        "content": "When marine scientist Sophia Rodriguez captures a mythical dragon in the Arctic depths, she ignites an ancient war between realms. Thrown into the luminous undersea kingdom of Aquaria, she discovers she is the prophesied \"Bridge\" between humans and the dragon king Tharros—whose enemies now hunt them both. As political strife fractures Aquaria and the primordial Leviathan stirs from the abyss, Sophia must master her awakening hydrokinetic powers alongside Tharros, a brooding commander, and a rogue witch. But their forbidden magic awakens a darker force: an abyssal guardian that hungers to devour all life. Can they forge alliances before the ocean itself tears apart?\nBeneath the Surface\nThe hum of technology echoed throughout the Genesis, a cutting-edge research vessel navigating the North Atlantic. Dr. Sophia Rodriguez stood at the observation glass, her hazel eyes surveying the vast expanse of restless waves. Despite the repetitive sound of the ship's engine, an unusual sense of foreboding coiled in her chest. Something about this area of the sea become special.\n\"Dr. Rodriguez, we're getting closer to the anomaly,\" Liam said over the intercom, calm but anxious.\n\"I'll be right there,\" Sophia said calmly, her heart racing. She tightened her coat around her shoulders and moved closer to the lab.\nFor the last six months, the Genesis served as her haven, a floating testament to human achievement. Every hall shone with superior generation, from the holographic displays in the control room to the docking bay's reduced part submersibles. Sophia, however, felt insignificant in the face of the ocean's mysteries, even though she was surrounded by reliable equipment.\nAs she entered the lab, a holographic map of the ocean floor became projected into the air. It pulsed with warm pink patches, indicating a peculiar thermal hobby.\n\"Observe this,\" Liam said, pointing to the projection. \"The temperature surges are unprecedented in our records. And the styles-\" He zoomed closer and saw faint concentric circles radiating outward. \"They are... intentional. \"Almost like a signature.\"\nSophia scowled and leaned closer. \"Water currents don't flow like this.\"\n\"exactly. \"It's almost as if the ocean is alive right here,\" Liam explained.\nThe thought became absurd, but Sophia couldn't ignore the strangeness of what they were witnessing. She paused to study the patterns before straightening. \"Prepare the submersibles.\" I need eyes on this abnormality.\"\nThe group moved into motion, their joy evident. Sophia stayed, looking, because the drone footage appeared on the main screen. The submersibles plummeted into the depths, their lights illuminating the darkness. The tide swallowed them whole, leaving nothing except an eerie glow in their beams to guide them.\nSophia's arms tapped against the console, an uneasy habit she couldn't break. The deeper the drones went, the stronger the ambiguous signals were. The dazzling rings became more intense, with modest bioluminescence emitted from their boundaries.\n\"Dr. Rodriguez, you might need to peer this,\" Liam explained, his voice unusually strained.\nSophia went toward the display, her breath caught in her throat. There, lighted by the submersible's lighting fixtures, transformed into something exceptional. Large coils of shimmering scales glided slowly through the water, glistening with an interior light that pulsed like a heartbeat.\nThe room became silent.\n\"Is it... alive?\" one of the younger researchers muttered.\n\"Be quiet,\" Sophia shouted, her gaze fixed on the display. The creature moved with deliberate ease, its length dwarfing anything she had ever seen. It wasn't just alive; it became cognizant. Each motion and shift of those glowing scales felt deliberate.\nThe submersible moved closer, its cameras focusing on the creature's delicate patterns. Because the group watched in astonishment, the creature transformed. For a fraction of a second, a massive eye filled the display screen, golden and unblinking.\nSophia's heart pounded. She could have believed it morphed into an unwavering stare at her.\nHours later, the creature vanished, but its presence remained like a shadow over the deliver. Sophia sat by herself in the lab, reliving the images. The way it moved, the way it examined the digital camera-it did not feel like an animal. It felt... clever.\n\"still at it?\" Liam's voice stunned her. He stood in the doorway, holding a warm mug of espresso.\nShe moaned and leaned lower back in her chair. \"I can't shake the feeling that there's more to this. Did you notice the way it looked at us?\nLiam nodded and placed the mug on the table. \"I did. Even still, it creeped me out.\nSophia offered a dry laugh. \"Creeped out is a real understatement.\"\nThey sat silently for a minute, the buzz of the spacecraft filling the air. Eventually, Liam spoke again. \"you think it's still accessible?\"\nSophia glanced out the dark window. \"I don't recognise. However, I don't think it's over with us.\"\nLater that night, the Genesis became unusually quiet. The majority of the squad had retreated to their lodgings, rattled by the day's events. Sophia remained awake, her mind unable to relax. The creature's images ran on repeat in her thoughts, its luminous scales imprinted on her memories.\nShe wandered through the ship, drawn inexplicably to the observation deck. The water stretched out before her, dark and vast. She put her hand against the glass, her reflection staring back at her. For a brief period, her own eyes appeared to flicker, their hazel colour changing to an unusual gold.\nShe jerked again, her heart pumping. It turned out to be a mild prank. It needed to be.\nThe ship rocked before she could hold on. Sophia grasped the railing for support as alarms rang throughout the halls.\n\"Dr. Rodriguez, record to the control room immediately,\" Liam said over the intercom.\nSophia ran down the hall, her pulse hammering. She entered the control room to find commotion. The main display flashed with static, and the delivery's stabilizers groaned under the pressure of strong underwater currents.\n\"What's happening?\" She demanded.\n\"The paradox's lower back,\" Liam said, his expression bright. \"And it's moving.\"\nThe concentric circles reappeared on the display screen, brighter than before. The water around them swirled fiercely, as if the ocean itself was being dragged in the direction of an important element.\n\"are we able to song it?\" Sophia requested.\n\"We're trying, but the contraptions are going haywire,\" responded Liam.\nThe ship rocked abruptly again, this time with greater difficulty. Sophia stumbled, grasping the console for support. The lights flickered, and for a brief moment, the entire scene became dark. Within the silence, a deep, resonant hum filled the air, as if it came from the sea itself.\n\"Did anyone else listen to that?\" one of the techs asked quietly.\nSophia nodded, her throat dries. It wasn't just a sound; it became a voice. Low and historic, it spoke in a language she couldn't understand, but the meaning was clear: \"Go away.\"\nThe hum got louder and vibrated through the Genesis' walls. The system sparked and the screens went dark. The ship's stabilizers failed, sending everyone plunging to the ground.\n\"Liam, what's taking place?\" Sophia yelled over the noise.\n\"I do not recognize! The paradox-it interferes with everything!\" Liam yelled and returned.\nSophia scrambled to her toes, her thoughts whirling. She needed to see for herself. Ignoring Liam's protests, she dashed to the observation deck. The scene that met her took the breath out of her lungs.\nThe ocean shone with electric blue light, the concentric circles expanding and vibrating with energy. At the center, the creature appeared, its scales brighter than before. It ascended from the depths, its massive bulk coiling about itself as it peered directly at the Genesis.\nSophia put her fingers against the glass, her anxiety forgotten in the face of such raw might. The creature's golden eyes fixed on hers, and all else vanished. She sensed its presence in her mind, a powerful pressure that murmured historical secrets and warnings.\nThe thing then vanished with a final faint pulse, leaving the sea calm once more.\nSophia went to her knees, her body shivering. Whatever this was, it was not over. It is no longer a long shot.",

        "content": "The Last Dragon\nSophia trembled as she held the console in the Genesis' management room. After the shimmering circles dissipated, the ocean returned to an eerie silence, but her instincts warned her that the creature was still around. It became ready. watching.\n\"Anyone, lower back to your stations,\" Sophia ordered, her tone rougher than she intended. The team sprang into action, but their looks revealed their discomfort.\n\"We've picked up movement once more,\" Liam said, pointing to the sonar. \"Southwest, a few kilometers from our current location. \"It is faint, but it is there.\"\nSophia leaned over the console. The signature was weaker than before, but still identifiable. Her pulse quickened. \"Prepare the containment systems.\" \"I want drones deployed right now.\"\n\"Are you extreme?\" Liam requested, his brow wrinkled. \"After what just befell?\"\nShe eyed him with a determined expression. \"We came here looking for solutions. That piece is the solution.\"\nHe gave a reluctant nod. Within minutes, the Genesis came alive with activity. The crew worked in deafening stillness, sending out drones equipped with stronger nets and electricity stabilizers. On the main screen, the underwater video confirmed the drones' descent, their brightness piercing through the dark depths.\nSophia's gaze did not waver. Some of the situations they were dealing with were unusual. It wasn't just an animal or a few mysterious herbal phenomena. It was something momentous, something that didn't belong in their world-or even in their own.\nThe anxiousness in the control room became overwhelming as the drones drew in on the feeble signal. The sonar beeped gradually, with each pulse bringing them closer. The sign disappeared without warning.\n\"What the hell?\" Liam mumbled as his arms flew over the controls.\n\"It's still there,\" Sophia said quietly, her instinct telling her something the machines couldn't. \"preserve going.\"\nThe drones moved cautiously. On the screen, the blackness of the ocean appeared to draw in closer, as if the abyss itself were alive. Suddenly, one of the drones came to a halt. The feed fluctuated, and the display was full with static.\n\"Drone three just lost power,\" a technician announced.\n\"Switch to Drone 2,\" Liam instructed. The second feed went live, showing the primary drone hanging in the water, its lighting fixtures dull. Something moved in the background-a flash of blue scales that was almost too quick to record.\n\"There it is,\" Sophia said softly, her pulse thumping.\nThe beast appeared before everyone had time to react. Its huge body coiled around the drone, its dazzling scales vibrating with energy. It became both beautiful and scary, a mythical creature brought to life.\n\"deploy the containment net!\" Sophia shouted.\nThe last drones went into action, freeing the internet. It rose through the water, its strengthened threads shimmering slightly as it closed around the creature. For a brief while, it thrashed, its motions so fierce that the Genesis groaned under the force of the currents.\n\"hold it regular!\" Liam yelled, his voice barely audible above the alarms. The strength stabilizers engaged, sending a pulse across the net. The creature froze, its glow dimming as the confinement system took over.\n\"Is it... working?\" someone inquired nervously.\nSophia grasped the console's edge as she watched the display screen. The thing remained, its huge form floating in the internet like a caught god. She sighed, her breathing unsteady. \"bring it up.\"\nThe Genesis's protective facility has become a marvel of engineering, intended to keep and examine huge marine specimens. However, nothing they had planned for came close to this. As the creature was reduced to the containment chamber, the room filled with a soft, ethereal light emanating from its scales.\nSophia stood at the statement window, unable to take her gaze away. It appeared smaller, curled up in the big tank, but no less menacing. Its frame shimmered softly, the light pulsing together with its breaths.\nLiam approached, his face a mix of astonishment and unease. \"What can we even call it?\"\nSophia didn't respond. Her focus was entirely on the thing. Something about it called to her, eliciting emotions she couldn't identify. It wasn't just an animal. It became additional.\nAs if in reaction to her thoughts, the thing changed. Its golden eyes opened and locked onto hers through the glass. She froze over. The relationship became instantaneous and electrifying, as if there was no distance between them.\n\"Sophia?\" Liam's voice ended the curse. She blinked, her heart pumping, and turned toward him.\n\"What?\"\n\"You had been... staring,\" he explained, frowning. \"like you have been in a trance.\"\n\"I'm exceptional,\" she exclaimed quickly, despite her shivering arms. \"Let's run a complete analysis. I wish to understand everything about this feature, including its biology and strength output.\nLiam nodded, but the challenge stayed. \"Be cautious,\" he said gently before going away.\nSophia returned to the tank. The thing had not moved, but its eyes remained fixed on her. She put her hand against the glass, and for a split second, the light from its scales flared brighter. She drew her hand lower back, her pulse racing. What was it attempting to tell her?\nHours passed as the crew worked feverishly to research the creature. Its electricity production skyrocketed, causing interference with their devices. Nobody may desire to explain the bioluminescence or the normal electromagnetic field it emitted. Then there was its size-significantly greater than any known marine species, with a skeleton form that defied sense.\nBut none of this defined what happened next.\nSophia was studying data inside the lab as the alarms went off again. She dashed to the preserving facility, her heart in her throat. When she arrived, the throng had already gathered, staring in stunned stillness.\nThe beast began converting.\nIts body shone brighter, its scales moving and retracting. As they watched, it began to cut back, its enormous shape folding in on itself. Limbs appeared where none previously existed, with the tail shrinking and the top redesigning. Within minutes, the dragon was long gone.\nIn its vicinity stood a man.\nThe room grew silent, the only sound being the low hum of the confinement subject. The individual looked up, his golden eyes penetrating and familiar. His dark hair clung to his face, and his bare chest rose and fell with each breath.\nSophia was unable to circulate. The closeness she felt earlier was deeper, more powerful now, as if an invisible thread connected them. The man's gaze latched on hers, and he leapt forward, his actions elegant despite the restrictions of the tank.\n\"What... is this?\" Liam regained control, his voice shaking.\nBefore each person could respond, the man raised his hand. The containment subject sparked, and the lights flickered. A deep growl echoed across the chamber, and the tank's glass fractured, forming a slender fissure that snaked over the floor.\n\"close it down!\" Sophia shouted, but it was too late.\nThe glass cracked, and the man went outside, water falling around him. The crew stepped away, worried expressions on their faces. Sophia stood on the floor, her coronary heart pounding in her chest.\n\"Who are you?\" she inquired, her voice firm despite the commotion around her.\nThe person cocked his head to analyze her. While speaking, his voice became deeper and more resonant. \"You don't realize?\"\nSophia frowned, her bewilderment clashing with the incredible sense of recognition she felt. \"recognize what?\"\nHe moved closer, his golden eyes glowing with depth. \"Have you already forgotten? \"What you are...what I am.\"\n\"What are you talking approximately?\" She demanded.\nThe alarms rang again just as he should have solved the problem. This time, it wasn't from the beast or the man. Something else occurred.\n\"We've got incoming!\" exclaimed a technician from the control room. \"multiple signatures, heading straight for us!\"\nSophia matured into the display. The sonar revealed six large things moving quickly towards the Genesis. Her stomach sank. Whatever was available, it was not nice.\nThe person-if he had become human-stepped in the direction of Sophia, his look serious. \"You delivered them here. Now you must face the consequences.\"\nThe room was filled with a faint, resonating hum. Sophia developed to become the man, fear and resolve battling within her.\n\"What are they?\" She requested.\nHis golden eyes narrowed. \"Hunters.\"",

        "content": "Supernatural Clues\nThe alarms blared through the Genesis, drowning out any other sound. On the main screen, the sonar display confirmed a handful of large things in quick succession. The tension in the control room became electric, with each breath sharp and every movement hastened. However, in the middle of the pandemonium, Sophia's attention became focused on the person who had previously been a dragon.\nHe stood unnervingly still, water trickling from his body. His golden eyes were filled with depth as he met Sophia's gaze. \"They're here for me,\" he said sincerely, his voice low but with basic weight.\nSophia clinched her fist. \"Who? \"What are they?\"\nHis lips twisted into a small smile, but it was devoid of humor. \"You're not equipped for that answer.\"\nBefore she could demand any more, the delivery jerked severely. Sparks fell from the ceiling as systems failed one by one. Liam gripped the edge of a console to support himself while shouting instructions to the others. \"Prepare for the effect! \"Everyone to the emergency stations!\"\nSophia tripped but kept her eyes on the person. \"If they're here for you, what can we do? How do you fight them off? Run?\"\n\"You may not be able to outrun them,\" he added, edging closer. \"however you might live on-in case you pay attention.\"\nSophia's irritability boiled over. \"Concentrate on what?\" \"You are speaking to me in riddles!\"\nHis expression softened slightly, but his tone remained firm. \"To the ocean.\" To the part of you that is aware.\nThe words hit a nerve, an echo of something Sophia couldn't quite grasp but felt deeply. Before she could respond, the delivery rocked again. A low, guttural noise rippled through the water-not from the Genesis.\nThe next few hours went in a blur. The beings, which the person had referred to as \"hunters,\" circled the spacecraft but did not assault. As a substitute, their presence loomed, an unspoken opportunity that kept everyone on track. By the time the fear subsided, the group was exhausted.\nSophia sat alone in her quarters, the hum of the ship's backup systems providing a faint historical background noise. Her thoughts turned into a barrage of unanswered questions. Who transformed into he? What were the hunters' names? And why did she feel connected to everything?\nShe closed her eyes, wanting to relax, but the moment she slept off, the urges began.\nThe first dream became fragmented, like pieces of a puzzle dispersed across her consciousness. She stood on the deck of the Genesis, but the water was unlike anything she had ever seen. The lake shimmered with light, its surface vibrant with color. Shapes flowed beneath it, huge, serpentine figures that danced like shadows.\nA voice that goes by her name. Deep, resonant, and hauntingly familiar. She became, but no one else did. The voice appeared again, this time softer. It was no longer merely a call; it had become a guide.\nSophia looked down at her hands. They shone faintly, the mild spread across her skin in intricate patterns that felt as natural as breathing. She raised her hand to the sea, and the water surged in answer, reaching for her like an old friend.\nBut before she could contact anything, the scene changed. Darkness devoured the gentle, and the dazzling ocean turned bloodless and lifeless. A pair of golden eyes appeared in the nothingness, peering at her.\n\"You've forgotten who you're,\" the voice said. It wasn't accusatory; it had shifted to sorrowful.\nSophia awoke with a start, her heart racing. She sat up and walked a hand through her hair. The radiance she had seen in the dream persisted in her thoughts, brilliant and unshakeable. It was not just a dream. It turned into a message.\nSophia returned to the lab the next day, attempting to shake off the dream and refocus on the current issue. The individual-Tharros, as he later revealed-was now housed in a guarded statement room. Despite the obvious hazards, she persisted on being the one to confront him.\nAs she entered, Tharros stood near the observation window, gazing out at the sea. He felt himself as majestic and untouchable, just as he did in dragon form. His skull got thin as she approached, recognizing her presence before she spoke.\n\"You're no longer human,\" Sophia said, her voice firm despite the storm of emotions swirling inside her. \"That tonnage is evident. But what are you?\nHe grew to be able to stand her completely, his golden eyes matching hers. \"you already know.\"\nSophia's jaw stiffened. \"Do not do that. Don't address me as if I were a participant in a sport. I haven't realized anything about this... about you.\"\nTharros took a step forward, his presence filling the space. \"You can't recall now, but it's in you. \"I felt it the moment we met.\"\n\"What are you speakme approximately?\" She demanded, frustration in her voice. \"Why do I feel... related to you?\"\nHis gaze softened, and for a fleeting moment, she sensed something vulnerable beneath his unshakeable exterior. \"due to the fact you're.\"\nSophia's breath tightened. She examined his face for ideas, but before she could press more, alarms sounded once more. Her stomach sank.\nLiam's voice arrived on the intercom. \"Sophia, we have a scenario. You need to get to the management room. Now.\"\nShe gazed at Tharros, torn between remaining and leaving. He nodded toward the door. \"cross. \"We will talk later.\"\nShe reluctantly turned and ran.\nIn the control room, anarchy ensued. The sonar came alive with interest, but nothing appeared on the displays. Sophia approached Liam, who began typing furiously at the console.\n\"What's occurring?\" She requested.\n\"It's the anomaly again,\" he replied, not looking up. \"But this time, it's everywhere. \"It's as if the ocean is responding to something.\"\nSophia gazed over the data. The measurements have been irregular, with bursts of energy emanating from all directions. Her thoughts raced. If Tharros become tied to the anomaly, is this also linked to her?\nAs the thought entered her mind, another remembrance surfaced-a flashback to her dream. The brilliant patterns on her skin, and how the water had reached for her. It wasn't just a coincidence. It was a clue.\n\"I need to head lower back to him,\" she stated abruptly.\n\"What?\" Liam gazed at her, as if she had misplaced her ideas. \"Sophia, we're in the middle of-\"\n\"I need solutions,\" she interrupted him. \"And he has them.\"\nBefore he could protest further, she had already left.\nWhile Sophia reentered Tharros' chamber, he turned to look for her, his expression unreadable. She didn't spend any time. \"What is going on right now? What does it have to do with you-or me?\nTharros looked her over for a second before speaking. \"Have you felt it? \"The pull.\"\nSophia hesitated but nodded. \"In my desires.\" And when I'm around you, it's overwhelming.\"\nHe drew closer, his voice low and steady. \"Because it is waking up.\" \"And so are you.\"\nHer pulse quickened. \"What's waking up?\"\nTharros' golden eyes darkened somewhat, as if the weight of his solution bothered him. \"The sea's heart.\" The energy that connects my type, your type, and the arena above together. It has been inactive for centuries, but something has changed. Something is rousing it from its slumber.\nSophia shakes her head. \"That does not make sense. \"I'm just... human.\"\nTharros inclined his head, a small smirk forming on his lips. \"You're not your usual self, Sophia. \"You would not have found me otherwise.\"\nThe phrases weighed heavily in the air. Sophia's thoughts reeled, but a small, unshakable part of her knew he was correct. The dreams, the feelings, the relationship-they were not coincidental. It was futuristic.\nThe ship jerked, cutting off connection quickly. Tharros' expression became stern. \"They're coming.\"\nSophia's stomach twisted. \"Who?\"\nHe didn't respond. Alternatively, he moved closer to the observation window, his eyes narrowing as if he could see into the depths. \"You'll find out soon enough.\"\nThe lighting flickered, and the room filled with the same deep, resonant hum Sophia had previously experienced. Her skin prickled, and the shimmering patterns from her dream appeared to burn themselves into her memory.\nSomething was coming, and she wasn't prepared.\nTurbulent Depths\nThe waves trembled deep beneath the surface of Aquaria, the enormous bioluminescent empire. Kael Stormwind, commander of the royal defense, stood on the entrance of the crystalline courtyard, his piercing blue eyes studying the shifting ocean currents. Something went wrong. He should feel it: an interruption in the glide, like a pulse out of sync.\nBehind him, the capital city bloomed in its usual brilliance. Coral towers spiraled into the sea's surface, their herbal glow throwing soothing light on bustling streets. But beneath the veneer of routine, uneasiness permeated Aquaria. Whispers about Tharros' departure had begun to spread, and Kael understood what that meant: instability.\n\"Kael,\" a harsh, demanding voice called. He grew to see Arin Blacktide, the mysterious sea witch, coming. Her dark hair swirled around her like a living shadow, and her violet eyes narrowed with concern.\n\"Arin,\" he said, his voice clipped. He respected her authority but questioned her motivations, which she reciprocated.\n\"You experience it as well,\" she added, more of a proclamation than a question. \"The king is long past.\"\nKael's jaws constricted. \"He will go back. \"He always does.\"\n\"This is extraordinary,\" Arin replied quietly. \"The water itself is stressed. \"You already understand what that means.\"\nKael hated admitting it, but she was right. The sea's enchantment became linked to Tharros' presence. Without him, the delicate balance of Aquaria's ecosystem-and its politics-were threatened. \"What do you want, Arin?\"\n\"To behave,\" she said really, stepping closer. \"You will be pleased to sit here and brood, but I am not. If Tharros is under attack, we cannot sit idly by.\"\nKael crossed his palms with a stern face. \"And risk a complete scale panic? No. Human beings must believe their king is safe.\n\"Lies won't keep them safe from what's coming,\" Arin said again, her tone stern. \"The Shark Clans are already stirring. The Whale Seers' forecasts become darker by the day. \"How long do you think we have before chaos takes hold?\"\nKael didn't respond. Instead, he became one with the currents, his mind whirling. Arin was not wrong. Tensions between the Shark Clans had been simmering for years, and without Tharros' power to keep them at bay, conflict seemed imminent.\nThe council chamber of the royal palace was filled with discontent. Representatives from each side fought over how to proceed in Tharros' absence.\n\"We need to mobilize the military,\" a Shark extended family emissary hissed, his sharp teeth glinting in the light. \"The king's withdrawal is a sign of weakness. If we do not act now, our adversaries will.\n\"Enemies?\" A Dolphin Pod diplomat snapped, her tone incredulous. \"The simplest risk here is your bloodthirsty ambition.\"\n\"Sufficient,\" Kael said as he entered the chamber. His authoritative presence immediately quiet the room. \"The infighting serves no purpose. Our primary focus must be on maintaining order until the king returns.\"\n\"And what if he doesn't?\" The Shark ambassador answered, his voice filled with determination. \"What then, Commander?\"\nKael's fists clenched, but his voice remained consistent. \"He will return.\" Until then, I propose that you remember who controls the command in his absence.\nThe emissary's eyes narrowed, but he said nothing more. Kael began to focus his attention on the council's relaxation. \"Tharros's absence is temporary. Our job is to protect Aquaria, not destroy it.\"\nThe room sank into an uncomfortable silence. Kael surveyed the faces in front of him, noting the combination of terror and mistrust. This wasn't just about Tharros; it was about the existence of their entire country.\nLater, Kael found himself in the throne room, his previous position being that of an empty seat of energy. The silence became deafening, broken only by the gentle buzz of the paranormal wards that protected the palace. He felt the weight of obligation bear down on him, more than it had ever been.\n\"You may not keep this collectively to yourself,\" Arin's voice reverberated out behind him. He did not turn.\n\"I don't have a preference,\" he said, his voice weary.\n\"You do,\" she said, striding into view. \"You just refuse to admit it. \"We are stronger together, Kael.\"\nHe gave her a sideways glance. \"And what could you expect me to do?\" Plan a coup? take the throne in Tharros' absence?\"\nArin smirked slightly. \"Do not be theatrical. I propose we work together-for Aquaria.\"\nKael's gaze hardened. \"I'll consider it.\"\nArin tilted her head, examining him. \"You are afraid. Now it's not about the Shark Clans or the council, but something deeper.\"\nHe didn't respond, but her remarks hit a nerve. She became decent. anything about Tharros's absence felt incorrect-like a little of himself turned into lacking.\nWhile the palace grappled with political instability, the deep sea tunnels shook with a darker force. Creatures long forgotten by human records began to rise, drawn by an imbalance of energy. Whispers of an ancient evil travelled through the submerged nation-states, carried by currents that froze the blood of those who heard them.\nArin's divination pool in her coral tower lit up softly as she performed her charms. The photographs appeared to be broken and traumatic, depicting shadowy beings and dazzling eyes, as well as an ocean split apart by struggle.\n\"Display me, Tharros,\" she muttered, her palms floating above the water. The pool's surface rippled, and for a brief moment, she saw him-certain and constrained, encircled by light and metal. However, before she could distinguish anything, the vision faded.\nArin tightened her hands, frustrated. Whatever she did to keep Tharros became effective, but she couldn't decide what it was. She wanted for better records-and faster.\nMeanwhile, Kael roamed the village, providing confidence to the locals. Despite his confident demeanor, doubt gnawed at him. The Shark Clans were mobilizing, with warriors gathering along the border. The Whale Seers' songs had grown to be melancholy, and their predictions spoke of a reckoning that would forever change the sea.\nKael understood he couldn't keep Aquaria together on his own. But trusting Arin-a witch with her own timeline-felt like a bet. Nonetheless, the decision will not be his to make.\nThat night, when the currents slowed and the city fell into a restless slumber, Kael stood at the capital's threshold, peering into the unknown. The water here was colder and darker, as if it concealed secrets and tactics that no one dared to explore.\nA small gleam caught his vision, and his breathing quickened. It became ephemeral, but unmistakable-the same gentleness that had enveloped Tharros. Kael's pulse quickened. He wasn't long gone. Not completely.\nBehind him, Arin appeared, her look unreadable. \"You felt it, didn't you?\"\nKael nodded, his jaw tightened. \"He's alive.\"\n\"For now,\" she answered bitterly. \"however if we don't act soon, he received't be.\"\nKael turned to face her fully, his determination sharpening. \"Then we act. together.\"\nArin's lips were endowed with an exceptional smile. \"eventually.\"\nHowever, as they prepared to seek for their monarch, the shadows in the trenches increased. Something ancient stirred, its waking linked to Tharros' absence-and its gaze was fixed on Aquaria.\nBreaking Barriers\nSophia stood inside the lab, arms crossed, staring at the glass enclosure in which Tharros was imprisoned. Despite everything-his change, his cryptic language, the hunters circling outside-he remained unnervingly calm, like a predator biding its time.\n\"Run the final series,\" she said Liam, her voice taut with recognition.\n\"You sure approximately this?\" Liam asked, his hands leaping over the controls.\n\"We don't have a preference,\" Sophia responded. \"We want to recognize what we're handling.\"\nAs the test began, the room became energized. A low hum hung in the air, and the advanced sensors inside the chamber lit up as they attempted to study Tharros' electrical discipline. Sophia kept her gaze fixated on his, searching for any signs of emotion, but his golden eyes remained constant.\n\"What exactly are you hoping to locate?\" Tharros inquired abruptly, his husky voice reduced by the hum.\nSophia blinked, surprised. He hadn't talked since the experiment began. \"Answers,\" she responded, defying her discomfort. \"Who are you? \"What are you?\"\nTharros inclined his head, a small smirk forming on his lips. \"And if you don't like what you locate?\"\n\"I'll deal with it,\" she replied firmly.\nHis sneer broadened, but he said nothing more.\nThe readings on the console soared without warning. Alarms blared, and the glass chamber around Tharros began to light softly. Liam grumbled under his breath while attempting to adjust the device.\n\"close it down!\" Sophia yelled, racing to the console.\n\"I'm trying, but it's no longer responding!\" Liam yelled again.\nTharros' expression changed within the chamber, from a smirk to something more sinister. His eyes shone brighter, and the power around him grew, crackling like a storm.\nSophia felt a shiver go down her spine. This was not just a response; he was doing it. \"Tharros, stop!\" she commanded.\nHe shifted his look to her, and for a brief moment, she saw something primordial in his eyes. \"You desired solutions, Sophia,\" he replied, his voice calm but powerful. \"permit me display you.\"\nThe glass cracked.\nThe power of the explosion knocked Sophia off her feet. She landed hard on the floor, knocking the air out of her lungs. While she looked up, Tharros emerged, standing in the center of the room, the brilliance of his strength casting long shadows on the walls.\nThe crew tried to recover, with some escaping and others shouting instructions. Liam reached for the emergency containment controls, but Tharros lifted a hand, causing the console to spark furiously, rendering it useless.\nSophia pushed herself to stand, her heart hammering. \"You don't have to do this,\" she replied, her voice calm despite the commotion around her.\nTharros looked to her with an enigmatic expression. \"You do not understand, Sophia. I am not your prisoner. \"I am your answer.\"\nBefore she could process his statements, he moved-fast, incredibly quickly. In a blink, he was in front of her. The section shifted as he put his arm around her waist and sprang through the enormous hole in the wall.\nThe frigid water swallowed her, taking away her breath. Sophia's instincts urged her to resist, but Tharros' grip became immovable. They sank lower, the Genesis disappearing into space as the sea engulfed them whole.\nSophia fought towards him, her movements frenzied, but his voice reached her, calm and steady despite the water. \"Sophie, stop fighting. Breathe.\"\nShe shook her head, terror spreading. Breathe? Is he insane?\n\"Consider me,\" he whispered, his golden eyes fixed on hers.\nSophia paused, then hesitantly took a tiny breath. To her surprise, the water moved effortlessly into her lungs, almost like air. She gasped as she realized she could breathe underwater.\n\"What... how?\" She maintained control, her voice thin and incredulous.\nTharros did not offer a solution. As a substitute, he tightened his grasp and propelled them forward with an efficient kick that slashed through the water like a blade. The currents considered the element for him and bent to his desire.\nMinutes-or perhaps hours-passed before they eventually slowed. Tharros launched her, and Sophia floated in the still water, recovering her breath. The sea around them had darkened and become numerous, but an unexplainable warmth held the sat back at bay.\n\"You're not human,\" Sophia said, her voice wavering from terror and surprise.\n\"No,\" Tharros replied actually.\n\"Then what are you?\" She pressed. \"Why take me?\"\nHe swam closer, his presence overwhelming despite the immensity of the ocean. \"Because you are no longer what you thought you were studying, Sophia. You do not belong in that world. \"You belong in mine.\"\nHer coronary heart raced. \"What are you speakme about?\"\nTharros' glare softened somewhat, and for the first time, she saw something other than power in his eyes. There has been a profound and historic letdown. I was interested in you, Sophia. Simply because you have shown interest in me. It is not a twist of fate. \"It is destiny.\"\nSophia shook her head, her mind reeling. \"That doesn't make sense.\"\n\"It will,\" he answered. \"but first, I need you to believe me.\"\nSophia paused. Each instinct told her to run, fight, or do something other than cooperate with this guy-this dragon. However, something deeper, more primordial, directed her to live.\n\"Why me?\" she whispered.\nTharros smiled faintly, a glimmer of warmth bursting through his austere façade. \"because you're the handiest one who can.\"\nBefore she could react, the water around them shook. A deep, resonant hum echoed throughout the ocean, becoming louder by the second. Tharros' expression hardened, and his body tensed.\n\"They've found us,\" he said.\nSophia's stomach sank. \"The hunters?\"\nHe nodded. \"live close to me.\"\nWithout waiting for a response, he seized her hand and pulled her farther into the waves. The water became chillier, the pleasant diminishing until they were engulfed by blackness. However, even in the pitch black, Tharros' presence transformed into a lighthouse, his golden eyes directing her on.\nThe hum intensified, and Sophia felt the water vibrate across her skin. Then, out of the darkness, shapes appeared: sleek, terrifying bureaucracy that moved with lethal precision.\n\"Live in the back of me,\" Tharros told his voice corporation.\nSophia complied, her coronary heart pounding in her chest. The hunters closed in, their bright gaze locked on Tharros. He stood on his floor, his strength radiating around him like a shield.\nThe lead hunter struck with startling velocity. Tharros moved faster, confronting the onslaught head on. The intensity of the collision sent shockwaves through the water, nearly knocking Sophia off balance.\nShe looked in awe and dread as Tharros fought, his movements a flurry of strength and skill. The hunts were relentless, but he kept his ground, protecting her with each attack.\nHowever, it was not adequate.\nOne of the hunters broke through, aiming directly for Sophia. She froze, terror paralyzing her. Tharros turned, his golden eyes widening as he saw the threat.\n\"Run!\" He shouted.\nBut there was nowhere to run.",

        "content": "Depths of Destiny\nThe chilly water squeezed against Sophia's skin like a thousand needles as the hunter closed in. Its smooth, predatory shape glided with ease, defying the turmoil around her. She couldn't breathe, not because of the water-Tharros had shown her how-but because of the primitive horror that gripped her chest.\n\"Run!\" Tharros' voice echoed in her head like a tidal wave.\nHer body refused to respond. The hunter's jagged maw opened, giving off an eerie bioluminescence. Every instinct urged her to go, but she was paralyzed by the crushing reality of her impending destiny.\nA sharp current tore through the water as Tharros drove himself towards her, his golden eyes blazing with rage. Time seemed to slow. Sophia saw the exact moment he stepped between her and the hunter, his form sparking in a corona of raw lightning. The hunter struck, but Tharros blocked its enormous jaws with his bare arms. The force of the effect resonated across the sea, knocking Sophia back.\n\"stay behind me!\" Tharros screamed, his voice unwavering.\nSophia gritted her teeth and swam closer, despite the panic in her chest. She would not cower. Not anymore. Not now, when so much is at risk. Tharros struggled with the beast, his movements a symphony of electricity and accuracy, but he couldn't always keep them at bay. There were extra shadows darting through the darkness, circling like wolves encircling prey.\nSophia's heart raced as she forced herself to imagine. If she remained idle, they would both be overwhelmed. The water around her hummed with an unknown energy that she instinctively knew had transformed into hers. Worry no longer gripped her; it had transformed into electricity.\n\"Allow me to help!\" she shouted, her voice echoing over the sea.\n\"No!\" Tharros' response was sharp, slashing through the conflict like a sword. \"You're now not equipped.\"\n\"strive me!\" Sophia aimed lower back.\nBefore he could respond, a second hunter lunged toward them. Sophia pushed her hand forward on impulse, and the water rippled in response. A wave of pressure erupted from her palm, meeting with the hunter and propelling it backward into the abyss.\nTharros hesitated for a chopped up second, his golden eyes fixed on hers. \"you haven't any idea what you simply did, do you?\"\n\"No longer, honestly,\" Sophia acknowledged, her voice shaking despite her success.\n\"Then research quickly,\" he said, his attention returning to the approaching hunters.\nSophia's thoughts raced. She should sense it now: the sea is bowing to her will. It was not just water; it was alive and full of energy. She reached out with her thoughts, wanting them to comply. The currents around her responded, swirling in a vortex, pushing the hunters further away.\n\"Correct,\" Tharros remarked, his tone indicating approbation. \"Now maintain them there.\"\nShe nodded, intent on maintaining the barrier as Tharros released his full strength. He moved with passion, his body blurring as he ripped through the attackers with relentless precision, leaving no doubt that he had transformed into their king. The water surrounding them hummed with power, and Tharros' bioluminescent glow illuminated the dark depths.\nFor a minute, it appeared that they had the upper hand. However, the hunters did not retreat. Instead, they regrouped, making their activities more organized and strategic. Sophia's temporary barrier began to weaken under the pressure.\n\"We can't keep this up,\" she continued, worry rising in her voice.\nTharros gritted his enamel. \"maintain on just a little longer.\"\nA sharp cry pierced the water, and Sophia turned to see one of the hunters breaking through. Its claws slashed at her, and she or he braced for impact. However, before it could reach her, a flash of silver raced through the water, suspending the creature and sending it spiraling away.\nSophia blinked, attempting to process what had just occurred. Then she noticed him.\nKael.\nHis lithe, muscular form moved with lethal ease, dispatching the hunter with a shimmering light spear. His eyes, a piercing blue, fastened on hers for a brief while, filled with both remedy and determination.\n\"You're past due,\" Tharros muttered, with a note of gratitude in his tone.\nKael grinned, his demeanor annoyingly confident. \"You gave the impression of you may use the help.\"\nThe two men settled into a groove, battling side by side with ease that suggested years of acquaintance. Kael's weapon flashed through the water, each attack unique and destructive, while Tharros' raw lightning annihilated their adversaries. Sophia focused on maintaining the barrier, her confidence building as she realized how much she could influence the currents.\nBut the hunters kept coming, seemingly indefinitely. For every one they defeated, the other two looked on, their bright eyes filled with venom. Sophia's power began to diminish, and her control over the water weakened.\n\"We must stop this,\" Tharros replied, his voice tight with worry.\n\"Working on it,\" Kael responded, his tone stern.\nA thunderous rumble resonated throughout the sea. The water surrounding them became chillier and darker, as if something far more historical and effective was stirring. The hunters froze, their predatory attention going closer to the source of the noise.\nSophia's breath froze in her throat as a gigantic shadow appeared from the depths. It grew unlike anything she had ever seen-a leviathan whose shape shifted and writhed as if the ocean itself had come alive. Its presence grew oppressive, and its power overwhelming.\n\"Stay at the back of me,\" Tharros said, his voice urgent.\nSophia hardly had time to respond before the leviathan launched a loud roar that sent shockwaves through the ocean. The hunters scattered, and their once-coordinated attack devolved into pandemonium. However, the leviathan was not interested in them. Its eyes became fixated entirely on Sofia.\n\"what's that?\" She muttered, her voice shaking.\n\"The past,\" Tharros stated, his countenance opaque. \"And it's right here for you.\"\nSophia's pulse raced as the leviathan approached, its massive body obscuring the faint light on the sea floor. Every instinct screamed for her to leave, but something deeper-something primal-kept her grounded in place.\n\"Whatever happens, don't allow it to contact you,\" Kael advised, his voice low and demanding.\n\"Why? \"What will it do?\" She requested, her chest squeezing with worry.\nNeither man replied. Their silence became more scary than any explanation could have been.\nThe leviathan paused, its large, dazzling eyes fixed on hers. It lunged without warning.\nThe Prophecy’s Shadow\nSophia couldn't think about how they escaped the Leviathan. The moments following its thrust were a swirl of noise and turmoil. Tharros had yelled something she couldn't understand, Kael had dragged her into the crushing currents, and then there was complete blackness and the unrelenting hammering of her coronary heart.\nWhile moderate, it became unlike anything she had ever seen. Warm, golden, and alive. It didn't flicker like the Genesis' harsh synthetic glow or pulse irregularly like deep-sea bioluminescent organisms. It became consistent, bright, and enticing, pouring from what appeared to be towering arches made of living coral.\nShe blinked, bewildered, as Kael helped her get to her feet. \"where?\"\n\"Aquaria,\" Tharros replied, his voice husky. His gaze was not on her, but on the vast space front of them.\nSophia followed his line of sight, her breath seizing. They were on the edge of a massive courtyard, surrounded by a city that appeared to be alive with activity. Crystal and coral systems spiraled in the direction of a light-reflective surface. The schools of vivid fish weaved through the spaces between, their movements synchronized like dancers in an ancient rite.\n\"Stunning,\" she whispered.\n\"Deceptive,\" Tharros mumbled beneath his breath. His tone jolted her out of wonder.\n\"What's wrong?\" She asked, taking a step forward him.\nHe didn't respond. As a substitute, he walked forward, his stance rigid and his visage unreadable. Kael hesitated, staring at her with something that conveyed the perception of the situation.\n\"Stay near,\" Kael said softly, following Tharros.\nSophia trailed behind them, her anxiety increasing with each step. The courtyard grew large, its floor covered in delicate mosaics that gleamed dimly. As they walked, individuals began to emerge from the shadows: tall, sleek beings with both human and unearthly abilities. Their eyes, like Tharros', shone with a golden glow.\n\"who are they?\" Sophia whispered.\n\"They may be Aquarians,\" Kael said. \"Tharros' humans.\"\nTheir stares sliced through her, filled with a mix of curiosity, distrust, and something she couldn't quite place. Whispers reverberated throughout the group, their words incomprehensible despite their significance.\nSophia's chest tightened. She felt exposed and vulnerable, like if every mystery she'd ever tried to keep concealed was being revealed. She instinctively sought for Kael, but he had already moved away, his focus on Tharros.\nThe dragon king paused in the center of the courtyard, his presence commanding. The whispers stopped, replaced by an oppressive silence. Then, from the far end of the courtyard, a person advanced.\nShe was hanging, her dark hair pouring over her shoulders like liquid ink, and her garments glowed with iridescence. Her eyes, unlike the others, were a piercing green, and they focused upon Sophia with such intensity that her stomach twisted.\n\"Arin,\" Tharros said, his tone courteous yet apprehensive.\n\"Tharros,\" she responded, her tone silky and funky. \"You've returned.\"\nHe tilted his head but said nothing more. The girl, Arin, moved her eyes to Sophia, her expression unreadable. \"and you've delivered her.\"\nSophia bristled at the scorn in her tone. \"i've a call.\"\nArin raised an eyebrow, a small smirk playing over her lips. \"Do you now?\"\n\"That's sufficient,\" Tharros said sternly. \"She is here due to the fact she has to be.\"\n\"needs to be?\" Arin repeated with a sarcastic tone. \"Or because you need her to be?\"\nSophia's arms tightened into fists. She had no idea who this person was or what her problem was, but she was not going to let herself be put down to. \"when you have something to mention, say it.\"\nArin's smile grew. \"Feisty. I'll see why you're attracted to her.\"\n\"Arin,\" Kael interrupted, his voice firm. \"This isn't the time.\"\n\"It never is,\" she said, taking a step back, her gaze calm. \"Very well.\" Let's hear what the monarch has to say.\"\nTharros turned to face the gathered gathering, his jaw tightened. \"Aquaria is in danger,\" he began, his voice steady but filled with an anxiousness that made Sophia's stomach turn. \"The hunters become braver, and the Leviathan stirs. \"The balance is breaking.\"\nA murmur spread through the gang, their golden eyes flashing with apprehension.\nTharros persevered. \"However, we are not without hope. The prophecy describes a merger, a confluence of energy on the way to restoring what has been lost.\"\n\"And you observed she's the key?\" Arin inquired, her tone suspicious.\n\"I don't assume,\" Tharros responded, his voice rising. \"I recognize.\"\nThe crowd's murmuring became louder, and their gazes shifted between Tharros and Sofia. She felt like a bug beneath a magnifying glass, with every eye examining and condemning her.\n\"Why her?\" inquired the person known as out.\n\"She's no longer one of us,\" the others remarked.\n\"She's human,\" a third voice said, dripping with disgust.\nSophia opened her mouth to cover herself, but Tharros spoke first. \"She is extra than human.\"\nThe throng grew hushed, their attention drawn back to him.\n\"She bears the markings,\" he continued, shifting his gaze to Sophia. \"display them.\"\nSophia blinked, anxious. \"Show them?\" Show them what?\n\"The markings,\" Tharros said softly. \"They appeared during the course of the battle. \"They are proof of who you are.\"\nShe stared at him, her mind racing. Markings? She didn't consider anything like that. However, she remembered the strange light under her skin and how the water appeared to respond to her. She slowly and hesitantly lifted her palms. The group watched, holding their collective breath.\nInitially, nothing occurred. But soon, thin lines of light began to develop on her pores and skin, forming complex patterns that pulsed with otherworldly strength. Gasps echoed across the gang, joined by whispers of disbelief.",

She became indifferent in being pointed out, as if she were not there. \"What does this mean?\"\nTharros paused, his gaze softening. \"In a way, you are the bridge between worlds.\" \"The only one who can bring us together.\"\nSophia shook her head, her heart racing. \"I didn't join up for this.\"\n\"No one did,\" Tharros replied calmly. \"but fate doesn't ask for permission.\"\nBefore she could react, the ground underneath them began to shake. The light in the courtyard faded, and a low, resonant hum permeated the air. The gang scattered, their whispers becoming yells of terror.\n\"What's occurring?\" Sophia asked, her panic rising.\nTharros' expression stiffened. \"It's right here.\"\n\"What's here?\" she asked.\n\"The Leviathan,\" Kael said coldly, placing his hand to the sword at his side. \"It's discovered us.\"\nThe hum became louder, and the floor shook more forcefully. Sophia's heart quickened as she appeared round, attempting to make sense of the turmoil. The shadows began to shift from one side of the courtyard to the other. Something massive and ancient appeared, its shape veiled but its presence clear.\nTharros moved forward, his physique exuding strength. \"Live at the back of me,\" he said, his tone harsh.\n\"No,\" Sophia answered, surprising herself with the energy in her voice. \"I'm now not hiding.\"\nTharros turned to her, his golden eyes flashing. \"This isn't your fight.\"\n\"Sure, it's miles,\" she responded, meeting his eyes. \"You mentioned that I am the bridge. Allow me to prove it.\nHe paused, his jaw stiffening. Then he nodded. \"live close.\"\nSophia nodded, her anxiety replaced by a steely purpose. She was not going to run, no matter what happened. She could confront it head on. This time, she refused to back down.\nShadows in the Court\nThe courtyard fell still now, but for the distant murmur of the sea's everlasting symphony. The leviathan's departure had left a gaping dread in its wake. Sophia stood inside the center, her heart beating and her bright insignia flickering as the strength she didn't quite comprehend faded.\n\"You shouldn't be here,\" someone screamed from the shadows of the crowd.\nSophia's gaze fixed on a group of figures near the courtyard's edge. They were dressed in sleek, dark robes, their expressions a mix of distrust and disapproval.\n\"This isn't the time,\" Tharros hissed, standing in front of her. His demeanor transformed to forceful, leaving little space for debate.\n\"It's precisely the time,\" responded one of the robed figures, a towering man with sharp abilities and cold, glittering eyes. He advanced, his posture tight and belligerent. \"The presence of a floor dweller here goes against all we stand for. You brought her into our sacred town and paraded her before our humans, for what? \"A prophecy?\"\nSophia scowled, her fists clenched. \"I'm right here, you understand. \"If you have anything to say, say it to me.\"\nThe individual's lip twisted in disgust. \"ambitious words for an interloper.\"\n\"That's enough, Veylor,\" Kael said, his tone strong. He walked to face Tharros, his attention fixed on the man. \"Sophia has verified herself.\"\n\"demonstrated what?\" Veylor sneered. \"Is she a hazard? That she brings the Leviathan to our doorstep?\"\n\"She is the one,\" Tharros replied, his tone steady yet cautious. \"The markings don't lie.\"\n\"The markings,\" Veylor snarled, his hatred evident. \"You area your religion in symbols and riddles even as our human beings suffer.\"\nSophia's chest tightened. She didn't know these people, didn't understand their background, but she felt the weight of their judgment weighing down on her. She glanced at Tharros, looking for some reassurance, but his eyes was fixed on Veylor.\n\"We're done right here,\" Tharros said, his tone quite final. \"The council will meet tomorrow.\" Any objections can then be raised.\nVeylor paused, his silver eyes narrowing. Then he bowed his head, though the gesture had changed to something more respectful. \"Very well, my king.\" However, know this: many people share my concerns.\"\nHe strode away, his fans trailing behind him. The group began to disperse, and their whispers filled the courtyard like a rising tide.\nSophia exhaled, the tension she hadn't realized she was carrying leaving her body. \"Who become that?\"\n\"Veylor,\" Kael said, his face grim. \"Leader of the Conservative Faction.\" He has been a thorn in Tharros' side for years.\"\n\"Why does he hate me a lot?\" She requested, her voice quieter.\n\"It's no longer just you,\" Tharros replied, his gaze remaining where Veylor had stood. \"He opposes something that threatens the vintage ways.\"\n\"And I'm a risk,\" Sophia said, the conviction settling deep in her chest.\n\"You're extra than that,\" Tharros stated, turning to her. His eyes softened, however simplest slightly. \"You're a symbol of exchange. And trade terrifies them.\"\nSophia nodded, though the burden of his words didn't make the situation any less complicated to bear. \"What now?\"\n\"Now,\" Kael stated, \"we rest. day after today may be... complex.\"\nSophia didn't sleep an awful lot that night time. The visitor quarters Tharros had led her to have been lovely-walls of shimmering coral, a mattress that seemed to flow on currents of water-however her thoughts refused to quiet. each time she closed her eyes, she saw the leviathan, felt the weight of the court docket's judgment, heard Veylor's venomous words.\nShe subsequently gave up and wandered to a balcony overlooking the metropolis. The view was breathtaking. Aquaria turned into alive, its sparkling systems pulsating with a rhythm that felt nearly like a heartbeat. yet the splendor best deepened her unease. She turned into an interloper here, no matter what Tharros stated.\n\"You're up early,\" a voice said, startling her.\nShe became to look Kael leaning towards the entrance, his fingers crossed. He regarded more cozy than she'd ever visible him, although his sharp gaze hadn't lost its part.\n\"Couldn't sleep,\" she admitted. \"an excessive amount of on my thoughts.\"\nKael nodded, stepping out onto the balcony. \"It's plenty to soak up.\"\n\"That's setting it mildly,\" she said with a wry smile. \"I didn't exactly plan on becoming the face of a prophecy.\"\n\"You're dealing with it higher than maximum could,\" he said, sudden her.\n\"Am I?\" she asked, her voice tinged with doubt.\nKael studied her for a second, his expression considerate. \"You're still here, aren't you?\"\nSophia laughed softly, even though there wasn't a lot humor in it. \"I bet I don't have a choice.\"\n\"There's continually a preference,\" Kael stated, his tone critical. \"and also you've chosen to live. that says some thing.\"\nShe looked at him, looking his face for any sign of the hostility she'd felt from others. but there has been none. most effective a quiet intensity that made her experience, for the primary time because she'd arrived, that she wasn't completely by myself.\n\"thanks,\" she stated softly.\nKael nodded, his gaze drifting lower back to the town. \"Get some rest. day after today can be... thrilling.\"\nThe council chamber become not like anything Sophia had ever seen. It become good sized, its walls coated with shimmering crystals that contemplated the bioluminescent mild of the city. on the middle turned into a circular platform surrounded through degrees of seats, each occupied through a member of the council.\nSophia stood beside Tharros and Kael, her palms damp with nerves. Arin turned into there too, although she lingered at the threshold of the chamber, her inexperienced eyes looking everything with a calculating sharpness.\nThe council members murmured amongst themselves as Tharros improved. His presence silenced them right away.\n\"we face a crisis,\" he began, his voice strong and clean. \"The leviathan has woke up. The hunters grow bolder. Our humans are in chance.\"\n\"and also you accept as true with she is the solution?\" one of the council individuals asked, gesturing closer to Sophia.\n\"I do,\" Tharros stated firmly. \"The markings have regarded. The prophecy is unfolding.\"\n\"The prophecy is vague,\" any other council member argued. \"It speaks of a bridge, however it does now not call her.\"\nSophia felt the load in their skepticism pressing down on her. She desired to talk, to defend herself, however the words stuck in her throat.\n\"She has shown her electricity,\" Kael stated, stepping ahead. \"She fought alongside us against the hunters. She held them returned while we'd had been crushed.\"\n\"And what of the leviathan?\" Veylor's voice reduce through the chamber like a blade. He stood inside the shadows, his silver eyes sparkling. \"Did she stop that too? Or did she draw it here?\"\n\"sufficient,\" Tharros snapped, his golden eyes blazing. \"This isn't approximately blame. It's approximately survival. The prophecy speaks of harmony. If we're to face towards what's coming, we need to embrace it.\"\n\"And what in case you're wrong?\" Veylor challenged. \"What if she brings our destruction in preference to our salvation?\"\nThe chamber erupted in a cacophony of voices, council participants arguing heatedly. Sophia stood frozen, her pulse pounding in her ears. She felt out of area, like a chess piece on the incorrect board.\n\"enough!\" a new voice boomed.",

Her presence become commanding, her green eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.\n\"Tharros is right,\" she said, her voice calm however company. \"The prophecy is unfolding, whether we love it or no longer. Rejecting it's going to handiest weaken us.\"\nVeylor's jaw tightened, but he stated not anything. the alternative council individuals exchanged uneasy glances.\n\"We can not have enough money department,\" Arin continued. \"not now.\"\nTharros nodded, his gaze sweeping over the council. \"we will reconvene the next day to discuss our next steps. till then, I recommend you bear in mind what's at stake.\"\nThe council participants murmured their settlement, even though their expressions remained cautious. As they started to report out, Sophia exhaled, the tension in her chest easing slightly.\n\"you did nicely,\" Kael said, his voice low.\n\"I didn't do whatever,\" she answered.\n\"You stood your ground,\" he said. \"That's greater than most could've carried out.\"\nShe managed a small smile, even though it didn't attain her eyes. the weight of the whole thing nonetheless loomed over her, and she or he couldn't shake the feeling that the worst became but to come back.\nLater, as she wandered through the town, she felt a presence in the back of her. Turning, she found Arin watching her, her expression unreadable.\n\"What do you want?\" Sophia asked, her voice sharper than she supposed.\nArin's lips curved right into a faint smile. \"to peer what sort of female has Tharros so captivated.\"\nSophia bristled. \"I'm now not right here for him.\"\n\"perhaps not,\" Arin said, her tone amused. \"but you are right here. And that's enough.\"\n\"What's that intended to intend?\" Sophia demanded.\nArin's smile faded, her expression turning serious. \"It way you're within the center of a sport you don't apprehend. And in case you're not cautious, you'll be the one who loses.\"\nbefore Sophia ought to reply, Arin turned and disappeared into the shadows, leaving her on my own together with her mind-and a developing feel of unease.\nThe Depths Within\nSophia awoke to an uncomfortable silence, her chest heavy from the weight of unresolved questions. The faint buzz of Aquaria's living buildings, the gentle ebb and drift of the water, appeared muffled-as if the metropolis itself was holding its breath.\nShe scratched her temples, still hearing Arin's cryptic warning resonate in her mind. You're in the middle of a game you don't recognize.\n\"Then I'll need to figure it out,\" Sophia said to herself, pushing off the side of the floating bed.\nA delicate knock stopped her thoughts. The door slid open before she could reply, showing Kael. His steely stare softened somewhat as he noticed her.\n\"Come with me,\" he said, his tone leaving no room for disagreement.\n\"To where?\" Sophia asked, narrowing her eyes.\n\"You'll see,\" he replied, his face inscrutable.\nKael took her to a chamber that was unlike anything she had seen in Aquaria. The barriers were smooth, practically identical, and a faint glow of bioluminescence danced across their floor. The center of the room was transformed into a circular pool, its water gleaming with an ethereal glow.\n\"what's this vicinity?\" Sophia asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\"The Mirrored Image Chamber,\" Kael explained. \"It's where Aquarians go to reconnect with the magic of the sea.\" It was now time to see Tharros' concept.\nSophia paused, staring toward the water. The light seemed to pulse, as if calling to her. \"And what am I presupposed to do?\"\n\"Step in,\" Kael stated sincerely.\nSophia's breath tightened. The water seemed alive, almost sentient, and the prospect of immersing oneself in it sent shivers down her spine. However, something deeper-an intuition she could not forget-drew her ahead.\nShe took a big breath and walked into the pool. The water became warm and pleasant, and as it swelled around her, she felt a strange strength vibrating against her skin. When it reached her shoulders, she paused, unsure what to expect.\n\"Near your eyes,\" Kael explained.\nSophia obeyed, and the arena around her faded into darkness. Initially, there was nothing. Then, gradually, she began to sense it: the heartbeat of something monumental and effective. It wasn't just the water; it transformed into Aquaria's essence, which flowed through her veins.\nThe markings on her pores and skin began to shine, reflecting off the chamber's walls. She gasped as a sudden surge of electricity rushed through her, overwhelming and exciting her.\n\"what's this?\" She muttered, her voice shaking.\n\"Your connection to Aquaria,\" Kael said, his voice unwavering. \"The magic recognizes you.\" It has been watching for you.\"\nThe power increased, and Sophia's head became overwhelmed with pictures. She saw the leviathan, its huge body writhing in the depths. She observed Tharros' golden eyes, which were full with commitment. She noticed herself, status in the center of it all, her tattoos glowing like a beacon.\nThe visions ended just as unexpectedly as they had began. The mild faded, and the water stilled. Sophia opened her eyes, her chest heaving.\n\"What what simply came about?\" She requested, her voice trembling.\n\"You awoke a part of yourself,\" Kael said. \"A element that's usually been there, ready.\"\nSophia stepped out of the pool with wobbly legs. \"This connection... is tremendous. How am I supposed to manipulate it?\n\"That's what we're right here for,\" Kael said, a slight smile on his lips. \"You're no longer by myself on this.\"\nThe next few days had been a blur. Sophia began to experiment with her newly acquired skills under Kael's supervision. The connection with Aquaria's power was both exciting and disturbing. She discovered how to control the water around her, sculpting it with her mind. She realized she should feel the sea's strength and currents as if they were an extension of her own body.\nHowever, it was not a smooth ride. The magic was perilous and unpredictable, and it had completely overpowered her at times. For the duration of one training appointment, a simple workout to develop a little cutting-edge turned into a raging maelstrom that nearly pulled her under.\n\"cognizance!\" Kael yelled, his voice fading amid the tumult. \"Don't allow it control you.\"\n\"I'm attempting!\" Sophia snapped, struggling to regain control. The vortex eventually subsided, leaving her exhausted and irritated. \"that is not possible.\"\n\"It's no longer,\" Kael said firmly. \"You're stronger than you realized. \"You simply have to believe in yourself.\"\nSophia glanced at him, her frustration turned to commitment. She would not give up. No, not just now. No longer is there much at stake.\nTharros appeared one night while she exercised alone in the Mirror Chamber. He looked at her for a moment, his golden eyes thoughtful.\n\"You're pushing yourself too hard,\" he said, stepping closer.\nSophia approached him, her hands still shining slightly. \"I do not have an option. \"If I don't figure this out, people will die.\"\n\"You can't save anyone if you burn yourself out,\" Tharros remarked softly.\nSophia exhaled, letting the strength leave her fingertips. \"I just... I feel like I'm battling for something I don't understand. Like I'm trying to solve a puzzle with half of the pieces missing.\"\nTharros nodded with a critical face. \"It's because you are. The charm of Aquaria is historical and complex. It does not give without obstacles.\"\n\"Then how am I presupposed to master it?\" Sophia inquired, her frustration evident.\n\"You don't,\" Tharros responded. \"You learn to paint with it.\" I agree with it. \"Just because it trusts you.\"\nSophia frowned, his comments both reassuring and frustrating. \"That's simpler stated than executed.\"\nTharros grinned slightly. \"not anything really worth doing is ever easy.\"\nSophia's confidence rose as the days passed. She still struggled and tripped, but each setback taught her something new. And slowly, she began to detect a manipulative experience she had not previously considered feasible.\nSomething changed one morning, during a schooling session with Kael. They had been practising limiting currents and shaping protective shields. It turned into an exercise she'd tried and failed before, but this time something worked.\nThe water responded to her order, creating a shimmering wall around her. It was not perfect, but it held, and for the first time, she felt a sense of accomplishment.\nKael grinned. \"You're getting there.\"\nSophia grinned lower back, and the weight on her chest eased slightly. \"One step at a time.\"\nHowever, not everyone was satisfied with her development. Veylor's presence hung over her like a storm cloud, his contempt obvious. He stared at her for the entirety of council meetings, his silver eyes cold and calculated. She could sense his resentment, his belief that she did not belong, and it gnawed at her.\nOne night, as she returned to her lodgings, she discovered a be aware placed below her door. The handwriting was unexpected, but the message was clear: be wary about who you trust.\nSophia's blood was bloodless. She surveyed the hallway, but it had become vacant. Clutching the be aware, she locked the door behind her, her thoughts racing. Who'd left it? What did they understand?\nAs she glanced at the notification, a disturbing thought occurred to her. Aquaria had become a metropolis of secrets and tactics, with him or her at the core. However, whether she changed into the most vital factor to saving it-or destroying it-remained to be seen.\nTides of Desire\nSophia couldn't shake the uneasy feeling she had after reading the note. It whispered across her head like an unwanted shadow as she immersed herself into schoolwork. The water around her swirled in rhythmic patterns as she focused on the sporting activities Kael had assigned her, but her consciousness dwindled with each passing minute.\n\"Your stance is off,\" Kael said.\nSophia turned towards him, her abilities clenching with frustration. \"I'm attempting.\"\n\"Trying isn't enough,\" Kael replied, moving closer. His blue eyes were piercing and fixed on hers. \"You are overthinking. Avoid resisting the present. \"Let it guide you.\"\nHis words ignited something in her, a moment of clarity in the middle of pandemonium. She took a long breath and let her fingers rest on her facets. The water responded right away, its currents wrapping around her like an arm.\n\"There,\" Kael whispered, his voice softening. \"sense that?\"\nSophia nodded as her heart raced. The relationship became clear, an emotional thread that connected her to the sea-and to Kael. His presence hung over her, not threatening, but compelling. She became uncomfortably aware of how close he had gotten, the heat of his stare scorching the water between them.\nHer voice caught in her throat as she began, \"Kael\"\n\"I understand,\" he said, cutting her off. His jaw tensed and he took a purposeful step backward. \"we can't let this distract us.\"\nSophia grimaced, her perplexity increasing. \"allow what distract us?\"\nKael paused, his hands clenched into fists at his sides. \"The pull,\" he said finally. \"It's more potent than I thought it might be.\"\nSophia's heart thumped painfully in her chest. \"What are you speakme approximately?\"\nKael shifted away, his shoulders irritated. \"A prophesy. It's not so much about energy or fate. It's all about connection. \"Approximately bonds.\"\nShe stared at him, her thoughts rushing to piece together his sentences. \"You imply you sense it too?\"\nKael did not respond, but the reality became written on his face. Sophia's breath hitched as the weight of his revelation dawned on her. Tharros was not the only one who felt a connection to her; Kael did as well. And deep inside, she knew he wasn't the simplest.\nLater that night, Sophia found herself exploring the town. The shimmering coral walls and glowing walkways had grown to be familiar, yet tonight they appeared to closing in on her. Her mind was a tangled web, with each thread leading her down a unique road.\nShe ended up near the coral gardens, a peaceful location she had grown to appreciate during her brief stay in Aquaria. The bioluminescent flora flowed gently with the currents, their light easing the tempest in her mind. She sat on a smooth stone and rested her head on her hands.\n\"You're overwhelmed,\" a soft, musical voice remarked.\nSophia looked up and saw Arin just a few feet away, her naive eyes glinting like emeralds in the dim light. The sea witch's presence was both disturbing and fascinating.\n\"Understatement of the century,\" Sophia mumbled.\nArin moved closer, her motions swish and deliberate. \"The magic is difficult to bear, especially for those who have not been reared with it. It's hardly surprising you're struggling.\"\nSophia sighed, her tiredness obvious. \"To say I am struggling is an understatement.\" \"I feel like I'm drowning half the time.\"\nArin angled her head, scrutinizing her with such intensity that Sophia's skin prickled. \"And yet, you keep battling. \"That's what sets you apart.\"\nSophia met her gaze, hoping to detect the same old hint of derision in Arin's tone. But it wasn't there. Rather, there was something gentler that caused her chest to constrict.\n\"I didn't think you cared,\" Sophia said, her voice softer.\nArin twisted his lips into a slight smile. \"I don't,\" she said, but her tone lacked conviction. \"However, I did locate you...\" fascinating.\"\nSophia felt a spark of something she couldn't quite identify. Intrigue? That became a common explanation for their tension, but there was no disputing that Arin's words weighed heavily in the space between them.\n\"Why are you truly right here?\" Sophia asked.\nArin drew closer, the coral's brightness reflected in her dark hair. \"due to the fact the pull doesn't discriminate.\"\nSophia's breath caught. \"You experience it too.\"\nArin's look remained constant, but her quiet sufficed. Sophia's pulse accelerated as the understanding hit. It was not only Kael. It wasn't just Tharros. Arin became attracted in her as well.\n\"This couldn't be happening,\" Sophia said, her voice quivering.\nArin came closer, her inexperienced gaze fixed on Sophia's. \"It is already going on. The question is, what are you going to do about it.\"\nThe next days had been a whirl of emotions. Sophia avoided Kael and Arin as much as she could, but the tension between them was too strong to ignore. Each look, every word, and every shared second seemed to be filled with energy, making her skin thrill and her mind run.\nTharros took notice of the direction. He wasn't one to miss a shift in dynamics, especially when it concerned the prophecy. One night, he confronted her in the reflection Chamber.\n\"You're distracted,\" he stated, his voice low but forceful.\nSophia gazed at him, her frustration rising to the surface. \"i wonder why.\"\nTharros' eyes narrowed, his golden stare harsh. \"This isn't the time for video games, Sophia.\"\n\"I'm not playing video games anymore,\" she lashed back. \"however you could have warned me approximately this.\"\nTharros's face relaxed slightly. \"You watched; I don't understand what you're going through. That I don't feel it either?\"\nSophia's chest tightened. \"That's the problem, isn't it?\" You all sense it. I'm stuck in the center, trying to figure out what any of it means.\"\nTharros drew closer, his presence overwhelming. \"This way, we can be certain collectively. Not by choice, but because of something greater than any individual. The sooner you hear that, the less difficult this may be.\"\nSophia shook her head, tears in her eyes. \"easier? For whom? Because it doesn't feel that way to me.\"\nTharros reached out, brushing against her arm. The contact sent a rush of heat through her, and for a little minute, the weight of everything appeared to increase.\n\"You're stronger than you realize,\" he murmured softly. \"You wouldn't be right here if you weren't.\"\nSophia looked up at him, her expression hardening. Then tell me what to do. \"How can I make sense of this?\"\nTharros paused, his eyes probing hers. \"Don't fight it. \"You embrace it.\"\nThe entrance of the chamber burst open before she could answer. Kael stood in the doorway with a grim expression. \"we've a problem.\"\nTharros stood erect, his golden eyes narrowing. \"What kind of trouble?\"\nKael's eyes moved to Sophia and then back to Tharros. \"Hunters are gathering. And that I'm not alone.\"\nSophia followed Tharros and Kael into the council chamber, her heart hammering. The tension in the room became obvious as the council members pondered their next steps.\n\"We won't be able to pay to wait,\" Kael muttered, his voice fading through the din. \"If the hunters are forming an alliance, we're out of time.\"\n\"An alliance with who?\" Tharros inquired, his tone harsh.\n\"Something darker,\" Kael answered, his jaw clenching. \"something we're now not equipped for.\"\nSophia felt a shiver go down her spine. She looked at Arin, who stood at the room's threshold, her expression unreadable. Their eyes met briefly, and Sophia caught a flicker of concern in the sea witch's eyes.\n\"We'll face it together,\" Tharros said, his tone firm.\nSophia gulped hard, the weight of his words settling in. It sounded simple, but nothing about it became easy. The draw between her and her so-called allies became stronger, and with a new threat looming, the stakes had never been greater.\nSophia's thoughts moved back to Arin's inquiry as the council's voices grew louder. What are you planning to do about it?\nShe did not have a response. Now, not yet. However, she knew one thing for certain: the tide was rising, and she needed to be prepared.\nCurrents of Trust\nThe council gathering ended in a nerve-racking impasse. Sophia remained in the rear as Tharros and Arin discussed strategy with the others, but Kael pulled her aside as soon as they exited the chamber. His demeanor turned to harsh, but there was a warmth in his gaze that made her uncomfortable.\n\"We need to speak,\" he said.\n\"speak about what?\" Sophia requested, crossing her arms.\n\"Aquaria,\" he said. \"And about you.\"\nSophia frowned. \"I don't have time for another lecture at the prophecy, Kael.\"\n\"It's not a lecture,\" Kael said, his tone calm but firm. \"You were pushed into the deep end without knowing what you were dealing with. I can help with it.\"\nShe hesitated, examining his face for any hint of an ulterior motive. There has been none except truthfulness. Later, she nodded. \"excellent. \"Where do we begin?\"\nKael took her to a remote cove beyond the main town, where the bioluminescent glow of the coral gave way to the darker, wilder vastness of the ocean. The currents here were stronger, and the water was cooler. It was both exhilarating and scary.",

        "content": "Sophia said, \"This area feelsspecific,\" her voice barely heard above the currents.\n\"It's miles,\" Kael explained. \"That is where the old magic runs most strongly. It is also where our people's past comes to life the most.\"\nHe motioned for her to sit on a cluster of clean rocks. As she settled in, he sat opposite her, his stance relaxed yet watchful.\n\"Aquaria wasn't always like this,\" Kael said, his tone unwavering. \"Millions of years ago, the ocean became a wild, uncontrolled area. Magic was not prepared or managed. \"It devolved into chaos.\"\nSophia leaned nearer, fascinated despite herself. \"What modified?\"\n\"The primary rulers of Aquaria,\" Kael explained. \"Tharros ancestors. They established the city's limits, controlled the currents, and formed strong ties with various underwater clans. However, their prowess arrived at a cost.\"\n\"What kind of cost?\" Sophia asked, her brow furrowed.\nKael's jaws constricted. \"They committed to the charm of the ocean. It strengthened them, but it also connected their futures to it. If the magic fails, so will they. And so does Aquaria.\nSophia let his words to soak in, the weight of their implications crushing down on her. \"And now the magic is breaking.\"\nKael nodded. \"The leviathan's rising, the hunters' aggression-it's all linked. The stability is fading, and we're not sure how to stop it.\"\nSophia looked down at her palms, the faint glimmer of her marks throbbing beneath the flesh. \"And you watched I'm a part of the solution.\"\nKael stretched out and touched her hand. The touch sent a jolt through her, yet she did not back away. \"I'm not simply assuming it, Sophia. \"I sense it.\"\nHer breath caught as she met his eyes. There was depth in his gaze, a raw honesty that left her feeling exposed. \"Kael\"\n\"Don't,\" he whispered gently, hardly a whisper. \"Do not say it is only a prophecy. Don't say it isn't real.\nSophia swallowed with difficulty, the words caught in her throat. She was at a loss for words and emotions. Everything she knew changed when his presence grounded her in unexpected ways.\nThe instant passed, but the air between them stayed electrified as Kael stood and stretched a hand toward her. \"Come on. \"Let us teach.\"\nSophia grasped his hand and allowed him to bring her to her feet. \"What now?\" \"Extra water manipulation?\"\n\"Something exceptional,\" Kael remarked, with a sneer on his lips. \"You want to learn to fight.\"\nSophia blinked. \"combat? Like, bodily?\"\nKael nodded. \"Magic is powerful, but it isn't consistent enough. You want to be able to defend oneself.\nHe guided her to a flat stretch of beach where the currents had been gentler. He picked up two narrow, coral-like staffs from a nearby rock and passed one to her.\n\"Start with this,\" he said, stepping back. \"let's see what you've were given.\"\nSophia held the personnel awkwardly, her fingers sweaty. \"I've in no way done this before.\"\n\"That's why we're starting now,\" Kael remarked, teasingly yet firmly. \"Come on. \"Show me.\"\nShe swung the staff clumsily, her movements clumsy and susceptible. Kael noticed the affects along with his own, a grin tugging at the corners of his mouth.\n\"Now, not bad,\" he said. \"For a beginner.\"\n\"beginner?\" Sophia fired again, narrowing her eyes. \"allow me strive that once more.\"\nThis time, she attacked with greater force, her movements spurred by determination. Kael blocked her again, but this time his look was one of surprise.\n\"Higher,\" he acknowledged. \"but you're still retaining back.\"\nSophia scowled at him, her wrath rising to the surface. \"I'm now not maintaining lower back.\"\n\"Yes, you are,\" Kael said, coming closer. \"You are afraid of making a mistake. Of losing the ability to manipulate. Stop wondering. Simply feel.\nSophia tightened her teeth, his words making her nervous. She increased the workforce again, this time relying on her intuition. She moved faster, her movements were more fluid. Kael easily stopped her, but their exchange had taken on a new complexity, with a rhythm that felt almost dance-like.\n\"exact,\" Kael said, his voice low. \"That's it.\"\nSophia misplaced herself in the motion, the rush of excitement propelling her to move faster and attack harder. For a brief moment, she felt invincible. But then Kael moved faster than she could follow, sweeping her legs out from beneath her.\nShe fell to the beach with a bang, the personnel slipping from her approach close. Kael stood over her with an enigmatic gaze.\n\"You're still too predictable,\" he replied, with no animosity in his voice.\nSophia grumbled and rubbed her elbow. \"you could've warned me.\"\n\"where's the a laugh in that?\" Kael remarked, offering a hand to help her up.\nShe accepted it, her inflammation subsiding as their eyes met. His glance conveyed something more than adoration. She felt it, too, a tug she couldn't resist.\n\"I'll get higher,\" she continued, her tone softening.\n\"I recognize you will,\" Kael said, keeping his grip on her hand. \"You've already come up to now.\"\nSophia felt a warmth spread through her chest, a sense of belonging she had not had in a long time. She averted her gaze, finding the situation too intense to bear.\nAs they traveled back to town, Kael began to teach her more about Aquaria's history. He mentioned ancient partnerships, conflicts waged in the shadows of trenches, and sacrifices made to maintain their fragile peace. His voice became more regular, and his comments were filled with a deep understanding of his fellow humans and their hardships.\n\"You care so much about this region,\" Sophia said, her voice tinted with admiration.\n\"It's my home,\" Kael stated unequivocally. \"I'll do something it takes to protect it.\"\nSophia nodded, her admiration for him increasing with each passing second. \"Thanks,\" she replied after a minute.\n\"For what?\" Kael inquired, staring at her.\n\"For helping me,\" she added quietly. \"For believing in me.\"\nKael smiled, lightening his generally severe features. \"you make it easy.\"\nSophia's cheeks reddened, and he or she looked away, wondering how to respond. However, before she could find the words, an unexpected chill swept through the water, causing her to quiver.\nKael tightened up, his fingers moving to the hilt of his sword. \"We're not by myself.\"\nSophia's pulse quickened as she surveyed the darkness. The sea around them appeared to darken, as the familiar glimmer of Aquaria faded into the distance.\n\"Live near,\" Kael said, his voice low and powerful.\nSophia nodded, her heart racing in her ears. Whatever became accessible, she knew one thing for certain: her education was not over yet.\nEchoes of the Deep\nThe shadows from the cove persisted in Sophia's mind long after she and Kael returned to Aquaria. Whatever had been watching them from the depths had vanished, but the kickback it left in her veins would not burn away. She had been getting stronger, but each new project reminded her of how much more she still needed to move.\nThe following morning, as she prepared to start her studies with Kael, a gentle knock resonated through the coral door. Sophia opened it to see Arin ready, her emerald eyes contrasting against the hallway's subdued glow.\n\"surprised?\" Arin asked, a smirk pulling on her lips.\n\"Definitely, sure,\" Sophia said, crossing her fingers. \"What brings you here?\"\n\"You've spent enough time learning brute pressure from Kael,\" Arin teased. \"Now it's time to analyze subtlety.\"\nSophia lifted her eyebrow. \"Subtlety?\"\nArin nodded and moved closer. \"You will never be able to grasp Aquaria's magic via raw force alone. It is alive, Sophia. It breathes, whispers, and sings. And it's time you listened.\"\nArin took her to a region of town Sophia hadn't seen before. The water here felt exclusive-calmer but throbbing with strength. They passed tall coral structures that lit weakly, their light paler than the relaxation of Aquaria's bioluminescent systems. The trail shortened and led directly into a small grove hidden amid a crescent of high cliffs.\nSophia's breath became caught. The grove morphed into something she hadn't seen before. The sensitive coral trees spanned overhead, their branches studded with shimmering orbs of soft. Shimmering plants swayed gently in the currents, their movements entrancing. In the heart of the grove stood a pool, its surface motionless and mirror-like, reflecting the vivid illumination around it.\n\"It's stunning,\" Sophia said, her voice barely a whisper.\n\"It's effective,\" Arin clarified, her tone respectful. \"The woodland is older than Aquaria itself. It is where the purest magic runs, uncontaminated by the palms of rulers or warriors.\"\nSophia turned to face her. \"Why convey me right here?\"\nArin's visage relaxed, and the sharp edges of her usual demeanor faded. \"Because you want to recognize what you are. \"What you are becoming.\"\nSophia scowled, her chest squeezing with uncertainty. \"And what exactly am I becoming?\"\nArin approached, her presence authoritative yet somehow reassuring. \"You are the bridge, Sophia. Between worlds and forces. You are the key to repairing what is broken. However, you cannot try this unless you grasp the magic that connects us all.\"\nArin motioned Sophia to accompany her to the pool. The surface shimmered as they neared, with tiny ripples spreading outward as if greeting them.\n\"Take a seat,\" Arin said, lowering herself to the pool's side.\nSophia paused before mimicking her. The water felt cool on her skin, yet it hummed with an electricity that made her nervous.\n\"What now?\" Sophia inquired, staring at Arin.\n\"Close your eyes,\" Arin instructed. \"allow the magic guide you.\"\nSophia moaned but obeyed. As she closed her eyes, the noises of the grove became louder-the delicate rustle of coral leaves, the faint buzz of the water, and the distant music of the ocean. Slowly, the strain in her shoulders relaxed.\n\"Experience it,\" Arin said, his voice low and calming. \"The magic isn't releasing you, Sophia. It is a part of you. \"Let it in.\"\nSophia concentrated on her breathing, following the constant rhythm of the water surrounding her. Initially, there was nothing. Then, like a faint whisper at the edge of her focus, she felt it: a slow and methodical pulse, similar to a heartbeat. It was not hers. It was not Arin's. It transformed into the grove itself.\nAs the sensation intensified and spread throughout her body, she exhaled sharply. She felt weightless, like if she were floating within the contemporary day of something massive and everlasting.\n\"Desirable,\" Arin remarked, her voice drawing Sophia back to the present. \"Now open your eyes.\"\nSophia followed instructions, and the sight in front of her took her breath away. The pool had altered. Its surface was no longer clear, but swirled with colors-deep blues, colorful vegetables, and glittering gold. Shapes began to form in the water: changing styles, illuminating runes, short snapshots of creatures she couldn't identify.\n\"what's this?\" Sophia muttered, unable to look away.\n\"The sea's reminiscence,\" Arin explained. \"Everything that has ever happened beneath the waves is here.\" Every achievement, grief, and mystery. And now it's yours to see.\"\nSophia reached out impulsively, brushing the pool's surface. The water rippled, and a fresh snapshot appeared-a figure she recognized immediately. Herself.\nShe stood in the center of the mirrored image Chamber, her markings as brilliant as ever. There were three figures around her: Tharros, Kael, and Arin. Their strength swirled together, generating a barrier of light that pushed back a shadow so dark that it appeared to swallow the ocean around it.\nSophia's breath tightened. \"what is this?\"\n\"The future,\" Arin said softly. \"Or one model of it.\"\nSophia pulled her hand lower back, her heart pounding. \"I do not comprehend. How do I know this is real?\"\n\"You don't,\" Arin said, her tone recalling the reality. \"The future is as fluid as the water. However, currents usually go somewhere.\"\nSophia glanced at the pool, her mind racing. She didn't want this-the responsibility and the electricity. It became hers regardless of whether she wanted it or not.\nSophia returned to her seat after what felt like hours, exhausted. Arin remained silent, looking at her with an unsettling intensity.\n\"Why are you helping me?\" Sophia inquired, breaking the silence.\nArin inclined her head, a tiny smile playing over her lips. \"because I see myself in you.\"\nSophia blinked, astonished at the admission. \"What do you suggest?\"\n\"I wasn't born into this life,\" Arin explained, her expression distant. \"I had to fight for my territory in Aquaria. To show that I belonged. You're doing the same, whether you know it or not.\"\nSophia watched her, trying to detect the sarcasm or ridicule she'd come to expect. However, there was none. For the first time, Arin seemed... inclined.\n\"Thanks,\" Sophia said, her voice subdued but honest.\nArin's smile expanded, but it didn't quite reach her eyes. \"Do not thank me yet. The most difficult phase still lies ahead.\"\nSophia scowled, prepared to ask what she meant, but a startling tremor beneath the trees broke her off. The water around them vibrated, and the shimmering plants faded as an eerie silence descended over the forest.\n\"What became that?\" Sophia asked, her pulse racing.\nArin's countenance deepened as her emerald eyes narrowed. \"trouble.\"\nThe tremor returned, stronger than before. Sophia stood, her heart beating as the grove's calm was replaced by an increasing murmur. Shadows began to emerge from the grove's rims, their figures flickering like smoke in the sea.\nArin rose beside her, her arms shimmering with a gentle emerald light. \"Live close,\" she urged, her voice steady but insistent.\nSophia nodded, the weight of her anticipated connection to the power pressing against her chest. Whatever happens, she may have to deal with it. She went towards the shadows alongside Arin, her tattoos beginning to shine again.\nThe Weight of the Crown\nTharros stood on the balcony of his apartments, his golden eyes riveted on the vast expanse of Aquaria before him. The metropolis shone softly in the faint light, its bioluminescent buildings pulsing to the steady rhythm of life. But this night, its splendor seemed muted, and its peace tenuous.\nHis palms grasped the railing, anxiousness coursing through his body. The council meeting statement repeated in his mind-Kael's warning about the hunters, a few factions' rising concern, and, most importantly, Sophia's simple presence at the center of it all.\nThe door creaked open behind him. Tharros talked without making a turn. \"I advised you I desired to be on my own.\"\n\"But, here I am,\" Arin replied, her voice filled with laughter.\nHe grumbled, but didn't argue as she approached. The soft rustle of her garments became almost drowned out by the low hum of the currents outside. She paused alongside him, her emerald eyes surveying the cityscape.\n\"You're brooding,\" she noticed, leaning on the railing.\n\"Now not now, Arin,\" he said, his tone harsher than he intended.\nArin raised an eyebrow, unconcerned. \"You have been like this for days. \"Can you explain why?\"\nTharros exhaled softly, his shoulders somewhat relaxed. \"It's nothing you don't already know.\"\n\"Ah,\" Arin replied, her smirk vanishing. \"this is about her.\"\nHe did not answer, but the flare of emotion in his eyes betrayed him. Arin straightened, and her expression softened in a way that surprised him.\n\"You're jealous,\" she said, not as a tease but as a statement.\nTharros stiffened as his grip on the railing tightened. \"I am her protector.\" It's my responsibility to secure her safety.\"\n\"Responsibility,\" Arin murmured, her voice tinged with doubt. \"Is that all it's miles?\"\nTharros grew to face her, his jaw tightening. \"What are you implying?\"\n\"I'm not implying anything,\" Arin stated, maintaining his eyes. \"But it's clear you care about her. greater than you care to accept.\"\nTharros moved aside, his quiet speaking for him. He despised how exposed he felt under Arin's scrutiny, yet there was no sense denying the fact. Sophia had gotten beneath his skin in a way that no one else had, and it was maddening.\n\"Kael feels it too,\" Arin added, her tone wary. \"So do I.\"\nTharros' eyes returned to her, a flash of rage breaking through his placid facade. \"I realize.\"\n\"then you additionally understand this isn't some thing any of us can manage,\" added Arin. \"The draw is stronger than anyone thought. However, that doesn't mean we should let it separate us.\nTharros moved away again, his countenance unreadable. \"less difficult said than accomplished.\"\nTharros awoke the next morning to find himself inside the royal education grounds. The large space was usually buzzing with activity, but today it was strangely quiet. Kael appeared there, sparring with a group of younger warriors. His actions have been flowing and unique, a great blend of energy and beauty.\nTharros stared for a second, his chest stiffening as he spotted Sophia's gaze following Kael. She stood on the edge of the arena, her countenance a mix of awe and curiosity. Tharros felt a primitive desire that he battled to conceal.\nKael noticed him and waived the establishment off, striding forward with his typical confidence. \"You're up early.\"\n\"needed a distraction,\" Tharros replied, his tone neutral.\nKael smirked as he wiped sweat off his brow. \"I didn't take you for the jealous type.\"\nTharros' gaze narrowed. \"cautious, Kael.\"\n\"I'm just pronouncing,\" Kael explained, his smirk fading somewhat. \"It's not a competition. \"We are on the same page.\"\n\"Are we?\" Tharros requested, his voice low yet charged.\nKael's expression hardened, as his lighthearted disposition gave way to something more extreme. \"You are the only one who said the prophecy is greater than us. Do not let your enjoyment get in the way of that.\"\nTharros said nothing, his gaze shifting quickly to Sophia. Her giggle could be heard throughout the area as she spoke to one of the younger warriors. It transformed into a sound that both calmed and unsettled him.\nKael followed his eyes and moaned. \"She is no longer a prize, Tharros. She is a person. And right now, she needs us to be aware of what's coming.\nTharros nodded grudgingly, his fists loosening. \"You're right.\"\n\"Of course I am,\" Kael said with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. \"Now, in case you'll excuse me, i have greater bruises to hand out.\"\nThe day was a flurry of meetings and preparations. The threat of the hunters grew progressively larger, and the council became increasingly concerned. Tharros barely had time to breathe, but his mind kept going back to Sophia.\nAs the evening approached, he sought her out. He saw her in the mirrored image Chamber, her fingertips glowing faintly as she practiced regulating the currents. She didn't notice him at first, her attention was completely focused on the water flowing around her.\n\"You're enhancing,\" he murmured, breaking the pause.\nSophia started, the sparkling water evaporating as she approached him. \"How lengthy have you been standing there?\"\n\"Long enough,\" he murmured, edging closer. \"You're getting better at this.\"\n\"Kael's been helping me,\" she said, moving a strand of hair away from her face. \"He's a very good instructor.\"\nTharros nodded, his face inscrutable. \"he is.\"\nSophia bent her head to analyze him. \"Is everything okay?\" \"You seem... stressed.\"\nTharros hesitated, his thoughts whirling. He wanted to tell her the truth and let her know how much she meant to him. But he couldn't. Now, not but.\n\"It's not anything,\" he finally said. \"simply the burden of the crown.\"\nSophia frowned, but did not press. Alternatively, she moved closer, her presence both reassuring and disarming. \"You don't have to carry it by myself, .\"\nTharros looked at her, his golden eyes softening. \"It is my obligation. \"My burden.\"\nSophia said, \"Perhaps,\" her voice soft. \"however that doesn't suggest you may't allow others assist.\"\nHer words hit a chord deep within him, and for a little moment, he allowed himself to believe that she was correct. However, the moment was short, and the barriers he'd built around himself dispersed quickly.\n\"Get some rest,\" he murmured, stepping back. \"day after today will be another lengthy day.\"\nSophia nodded, but her gaze remained on his as he departed. Tharros breathed as the door closed behind him, and the weight on his chest became heavier.\nLater that night, Tharros stood on the balcony again, the town silent beneath him. He couldn't stop thinking about the prophecy and the tug he felt for Sophia, Aquaria's delicate team spirit.\nA gentle knock interrupted his thoughts. He grew into Kael status inside the doorway.\n\"what's it now?\" Tharros inquired, his tone weary.",

        "content": "\"We want to talk,\" Kael remarked as he stepped inside. \"about Sophia.\"\nTharros stiffened but did not say anything.\nKael crossed his hands with a solemn gaze. \"We both get it, Tharros. The pull; the bond. Ignoring it does not make it go away.\"\nTharros clinched his jaw. \"And what do you advocate?\"\nKael sighed. \"We work together.\" For her and Aquaria. This is not about us. \"It is about the prophecy.\"\nTharros looked at him for a long moment, his golden eyes glowing with an intensity that made Kael nervous. But then, to Kael's surprise, Tharros nodded.\n\"You're right,\" Tharros said quietly. \"For as soon as, you're proper.\"\nKael's lips curved into a slight smile. \"Don't get used to it.\"\nTharros let himself a tiny snicker, and the tension between them subsided slightly. However, when the laughing faded, the gravity of their position reappeared.\n\"We'll face this together,\" Tharros stated, his voice firm. \"irrespective of what it takes.\"\nKael nodded, his face determined. \"Agreed.\"\nAs they stood in silence, the city below seemed to shine brighter, as if it were emitting a spark of yearning. However, in the distance, a shadow moved, reminding them that their efforts were far from done.\nThreads of the Deep\nSophia peered over the scrolls on the coral table in the palace library, her brow wrinkled with concentration. The delicate calligraphy, written in an Aquarian language she barely understood, flowed across the parchment like ocean currents. A stack of her old research notes was beside her, added from the Genesis at Tharros' suggestion.\n\"I don't see the relationship,\" she said to herself, going through her notes and scrolls.\nThe library fell silent, but for the gentle buzz of magical energy that seemed to permeate every corner of Aquaria. Sophia's frustration grew as she tried to make sense of the symbols, her scientific mind struggling with the enigmatic nature of magic.\n\"Speaking to yourself will not make it any clearer,\" Arin said, performing from the back of one of the tall coral shelves. Her voice was characteristically amusing and incisive.\nSophia jumped barely but quickly, concealing her amazement. \"What are you doing right here?\"\n\"I could ask you the equal,\" Arin said, moving closer. \"but i've a sense you're chasing solutions.\"\n\"I'm,\" Sophia admitted. \"though I'm starting to suppose I won't find them.\"\nArin leaned in opposite to the desk, her emerald eyes studying the scrolls. \"What exactly are you looking for?\"\nSophia hesitated before responding. \"I've been comparing Aquaria's magic to the heat signatures and strength readings we took with the Genesis. Something about them seems... linked.\"\nArin raised an eyebrow, fascinated. \"connected how?\"\nSophia ran a hand through her hair, attempting to organize her thoughts. \"The power we detected came to life. It did not act like anything we had found on the surface. The styles, the fluctuations-they had been too precise, too deliberate.\"\n\"And you observed it's related to Aquaria's magic?\" Arin inquired, her tone serious.\n\"I don't think,\" Sophia said, her voice steely. \"I know.\"\nArin's smile faded, replaced by genuine interest. \"Then show me.\"\nSophia took Arin to the mirrored image Chamber, her fingers full with notes and technology salvaged from the Genesis. The familiar hum of the chamber greeted them as they entered, its quiet waters shimmering slightly in the bioluminescent light.\n\"This,\" Sophia began, placing her notes on a nearby stone pedestal. These power readings were recorded along the same ditch where Tharros moved location.\"\nArin's brow furrowed slightly as she studied the graphs and figures. \"And?\"\n\"And,\" Sophia went on, \"the strength readings fit the patterns in Aquaria's magic.\"\nArin scowled and appeared suspicious. \"That's an ambitious declare.\"\nSophia approached the pool, her markings slightly gleaming as she reached out to touch the surface. The water rippled beneath her hand, reacting to her presence.\n\"I'll show it,\" she stated with resolve in her voice.\nShe closed her eyes and focused on the electricity surrounding her. The currents in the chamber pulsed in sync with her heartbeat, and the light of her tattoos became brighter. She reached deeper, allowing the magic to guide her.\nThe water began to whirl, with faint images appearing in its depths. They were hazy at first, but then shapes appeared-styles that matched the graphs on her notes. Arin's sudden intake of breath revealed what Sophia already knew.\n\"It's identical,\" Arin muttered, her tone tinged with wonder. \"How is that possible?\"\nSophia opened her eyes, her chest rising and falling with effort. \"because the charm of Aquaria and the strength we detected are equal. The sea is alive, Arin. It isn't just water; it's a living, breathing entity.\"\nArin glanced at her, a rare expression of uncertainty on her face. \"If that's genuine... it changes everything.\"\nThe news of Sophia's finding spread swiftly, and by the next morning, the council had met to discuss its consequences. Tharros, Kael, and Arin stood with Sophia's facet, creating a tense atmosphere in the chamber.\nSophia improved, but her nerves threatened to betray her. She took a long breath to prepare herself before addressing the council.\n\"I've located a connection among Aquaria's magic and the strength my team detected at the floor,\" she started to explain. \"The patterns are equivalent. \"This is not a coincidence.\"\nThe council mumbled to itself, their emotions a combination of cynicism and interest. Veylor, sat at the far end of the chamber, leaned forward, his silver eyes narrowing.\n\"What are you suggesting, surface dweller?\" He inquired, his tone oozing with contempt.\nSophia met his stare and refused to back down. \"I propose that the balance of Aquaria's magic is tied to the health of the sea itself. If the magic fails, it is because the water represents the death of life.\"\nA ripple of surprise swept across the council, their whispers becoming louder. Tharros lifted a hand to silence them.\n\"Give an explanation for,\" he said calmly but commandingly.\nSophia nodded, grateful for his support. \"My research revealed rising temperatures and unusual electrical spikes near the ditch. It's as if the water is crying out. And now, with the Leviathan stirring, it is clear that something is extremely wrong.\"\n\"And you think you could restore it?\" Veylor asked in a sarcastic tone.\n\"I don't understand,\" Sophia said, her tone unwavering. \"but I believe I'm part of the answer.\"\nTharros advanced, his golden gaze fixed on the council. \"We will not overlook this. If Sophia is correct, then the fate of Aquaria-and the ocean itself-depends on us.\"\nThe council remained silent, their discomfort evident. Veylor sat back into his chair, his countenance unreadable. Finally, he spoke.\n\"If she fails, it will likely be on your head, Tharros.\"\nTharros didn't hesitate. \"If we do not anything, failure is guaranteed.\"\nTharros pulled Sophia aside as the council disbanded, his countenance softer than she had expected.\n\"You did nicely,\" he replied quietly.\nSophia sighed as fatigue settled over her. \"I don't experience like I did.\"\n\"You stood on your floor,\" Tharros remarked. \"That's extra than most might've completed.\"\nSophia mustered a faint smile, but her thoughts remained somber. \"What if I'm wrong?\"\n\"You are no longer,\" Tharros declared forcefully. \"I believe you.\"\nSophia gazed up at him, her chest straining from the earnestness in his eyes. Before she could respond, Kael approached, interrupting the moment.\n\"We have a problem,\" Kael explained, his tone somber.\n\"What now?\" Tharros asked, his expression darkening.\nKael's jaws constricted. \"They're hunters. They are at the circulate.\"\nSophia's stomach fell, and the weight of her discoveries was immediately forgotten. Something came, and she realized they'd been going for walks out of time.\nThe Burden of Destiny\nThe council chamber became filled. Every seat was taken, and Aquarians from all factions crowded the upper balconies, their golden eyes fixed on the main platform, where Tharros stood with Kael, Arin, and Sophia. The air was filled with tension, expectation thick enough to taste.\nSophia's pulse quickened. The weight of so many gazes pushed down on her, and the odd whispers in Aquaria's historical language just added to her anxiety.\n\"This collecting is exceptional,\" Veylor commented, breaking the stillness. He stood in his customary spot, his silver eyes blazing as they scanned the gang. \"We are here no longer to act, but to discuss the means of prophesy. Is this what our once-proud council has been reduced to?\"\nTharros' golden stare penetrated Veylor. \"We're right here because the stakes require it. If you choose lack of expertise, I urge you go.\"\nThe chamber was filled with murmuring, and Veylor's lip twisted, but he did not respond. Tharros indicated for the room to be silent, his dominating presence acting as an anchor.\n\"Sophia's arrival has sparked the awakening of ancient forces,\" Tharros stated, his voice resonating throughout the chamber. \"The prophesy speaks of a bridge-of someone who can bring together what has long been separated. Whether you believe in it or not, her presence is not an accident.\"\n\"And yet, we still don't understand this bridge,\" another councilor said, her tone tinged with uncertainty. \"What is she supposed to unite for?\" The surface or the ocean? \"Or something more dangerous?\"\nSophia took a step forward before she should have, her want to speak overpowering her anxiety. \"The prophesy does not explain everything in detail, but isn't that the point? Prophecies manual-they do not give you all of the solutions. What we do know is that something is threatening the global, and it is related to me. Ignoring that will not change that.\"\nHer words hung in the air, and the silence that followed was almost oppressive. Then, to her surprise, Arin said.\n\"The girl is proper,\" Arin said, her green eyes keen. \"The prophecy is not designed to soothe us, but to prepare us. Whether you embrace her or not, the truth remains: trade is coming, and none of us are prepared.\nThe debate heated up as council members disagreed on what the prophecy meant. Some welcomed Sophia's arrival as a sign of hope, while others saw it as a portent of disaster. As the hours passed, the voices faded into a cacophony of discord, leaving Sophia to battle with her own uncertainties.\nKael leaned closer, his voice low so she could hear. \"If we let them, they'll keep talking in circles until the tide turns. Don't let their noise to distract you.\"\nSophia gave a slight nod, grateful for his steadying presence. Even with his help, she couldn't shake the feeling of uneasiness. She became into no bridge and no savior. She was merely a scientist who had strayed into a world she did not understand.\n\"sufficient,\" Tharros' voice bellowed, piercing through the confusion. The chamber grew silent, and all eyes turned to him. \"We are losing time. The prophecy refers to togetherness rather than departments. If we continue to debate over interpretations, we will doom ourselves before the opportunity even arises.\"\n\"And what's this threat?\" Veylor challenged with a bloodless voice. \"The Leviathan?\" What about the hunters? Or maybe it's her? He pointed directly at Sophia, his words like a knife struck at her heart.\nSophia's stomach knotted as the murmuring increased again. However, before she could communicate, Arin moved forward, her gaze fixed on Veylor.\n\"Be careful, Veylor,\" she advised with an icy tone. \"Blaming the woman is simple, but it won't help when the darkness comes. We have all seen the signs and symptoms. You cannot deny them.\"\nVeylor's jaw tightened, but he said nothing.",

        "content": "Tharros seizes the moment. \"Sophia is not our enemy. She is our ally, whether you want it or not. And, if the prophecy is to be believed, she may be the only one capable of preventing what is coming.\"\nAfter several hours of discussion, the council eventually adjourned. The chamber slowly emptied, with council members and bystanders whispering amongst themselves. Sophia lingered near the platform, tiredness tugging at her as the weight of the day pulled against her shoulders.\n\"You did properly,\" Kael said, approaching her. \"no longer many could've stood in front of them like that.\"\nSophia gave a bitter snigger. \"I didn't sense like I did well.\"\n\"You held your floor,\" Kael replied. \"That's more than sufficient.\"\nArin joined them, her keen stare softening as it rested on Sophia. \"You talked with conviction. That was what they needed to focus on.\"\n\"Did it even remember?\" Sophia inquired, her displeasure leaking through. \"It seems like all we did was speak.\"\n\"Phrases carry weight,\" Arin replied sincerely. \"even if it doesn't look like it.\"\nTharros approached with an inscrutable look. \"Tonight, the council will deliberate. They will not make a speedy decision, but at the very least they are listening.\"\nSophia caught his look, hoping to find encouragement. \"And what do we do within the meantime?\"\nTharros' jaw tightened, and for a brief moment, he felt as if he held the weight of the water itself. \"We put together.\"\nSophia was unable to sleep that night. Her mind raced with thoughts of the prophecy, the hunters, and the rising pressure around her. She walked through the palace, the calm halls offering little comfort.\nFinally, she found herself in the mirrored image Chamber. The water transformed into itself, its surface reflecting the gentle glow of the bioluminescent crystals above. She sat beside the pool, her reflection staring back at her, faint but undeniable.\n\"What do you want from me?\" She whispered to the quiet water. \"What am I alleged to do?\"\nThe river rippled, even though there was no modern-day. Faint shapes began to form inside its depths, patterns she recognized from her previous connection to the power. But this time, the shapes were crisper and sharper.\nShe saw the leviathan, its massive body writhing in the depths. She noticed the hunters, their sleek forms moving with lethal precision. She then recognized herself, standing in the center of it all, her tattoos flashing with mild as she held back the darkness.\nThe vision faded, leaving Sophia breathless. She peered at the ocean, her chest taut with fear and determination.\n\"nevertheless chasing answers?\" A voice came from behind her.\nSophia turned to face Tharros, who stood within the doorway, his golden eyes compassionate yet weary.\n\"Constantly,\" she responded quietly.\nHe moved closer, his presence grounding her. \"You can't find all of the answers here. \"But you'll find enough to keep going.\"\nSophia nodded, the weight of his words settling on her. \"I simply wish it's sufficient.\"\nTharros' stare lingered on her, a flash of unsaid communication traveling between them. But before either of them could speak, a powerful tremor shook the chamber. The water in the pool rippled furiously, and the faint hum of the palace's enchantment became increasingly agitated.\nSophia's heart raced as Tharros stepped in front of her, his presence unsettling. \"something's incorrect.\"\nThe tremor returned, stronger than before. A deep, resonant hum rose from the depths of the mirrored image Chamber, sending shivers down Sophia's spine.\n\"What's that?\" she whispered.\nTharros' golden eyes flared with depth as he gazed into the pool. \"the beginning.\"\nShadows in the Court\nThe palace had transformed into a fortress of light and water, but this night it felt like a cage. The worry from the council meeting persisted, compounded by the foreboding tremors in the contemplation Chamber. Aquaria seemed to hold its breath, the currents stronger, and the magic in the air agitated.\nTharros walked through the quiet corridors, his golden eyes studying the dimly lighted rooms. The day's debates had exhausted him, and despite his regular steps, the weight on his shoulders appeared unbearable. Each decision he made felt like a thread in a delicate web, with one incorrect flow threatening to unravel the entire thing.\nSophia returned to her lodgings, fatigued but determined. Kael and Arin waited in the back, ensuring that the council dispersed without incident. Tharros was suddenly on his own, his thoughts a raging maelstrom that he couldn't control.\nAs he approached the large staircase leading to the throne room, a faint sound drew his attention. A tiny alteration in the water that could not have happened by chance. Tharros froze up, his instincts sharpening.\n\"Display yourself,\" he ordered, his voice ringing throughout the chamber.\nBefore everything, there was nothing. Then a parent emerged from the shadows. The assassin moved with lethal ease, wearing dark, scaled armor and holding a shining blade. The currents around them talked of violence, and the air was heavy with intent.\nTharros' gaze narrowed. \"You dare assault me right here?\"\nThe murderer said nothing, and the quiet was more unnerving than any danger. They lunged, the sword slicing through the water with murderous accuracy. Tharros sidestepped, and the strike missed him by inches. His hand lit with golden mild as he summoned his power, causing the currents to bend to his will.\n\"idiot,\" Tharros hissed, his tone low and dangerous. \"You'll remorse this.\"\nThe altercation became violent. The assassin's actions were quick and deliberate, and their blade was an extension of their will. Tharros responded with raw power, each strike of his magic sending shockwaves through the ocean. The palace rocked as their struggle heated up, bioluminescent crystals flickering in response to the pressure of their attacks.\nThe assassin became professional, but Tharros became unstoppable. He escaped a violent blow and responded with a powerful strike that sent the attacker falling into a pillar. The assassins recovered quickly, their expressions disguised under black masks, but Tharros should feel their mounting displeasure.\n\"You're true,\" Tharros said, his voice mocking. \"but now not top enough.\"\nThe murderer charged once more, blade pointed at his chest. Tharros deflected it with a wave of his palm, and the pressure threw the weapon from their hands. Before the attacker could recover, he trapped them against the wall, his golden eyes blazing.\n\"Who sent you?\" He demanded, his voice a snarl.\nThe murderer fought, and their quiet was aggravating. Tharros tightened his grip, causing the water around him to vibrate with his barely contained wrath. \"solution me.\"\nBefore he could push similarly, a surprising explosion shook the palace. The shockwave sent Tharros spinning, and the assassin slipped from his draw close. Through the dust and turmoil, he noticed them retreating into the darkness.\nThe ruckus drew the palace guards, who prepared their weapons before pouring into the chamber. Kael and Arin arrived shortly later, their expressions dismal as they surveyed the situation.\n\"What occurred?\" Kael asked, his voice harsh.\n\"An assassin,\" Tharros remarked, his voice tight. \"They escaped at some stage in the blast.\"\nArin's emerald eyes narrowed as she assessed the damage. \"This was not at random. Someone intended you to be useless.\n\"Or wanted to send a message,\" Kael said, his attention shifting to the charred marks on the dividers.\nTharros clenched his fists, his rage barely restrained. \"They gained't prevail.\"\n\"We need to calm the palace,\" Kael said, his tone calm but forceful. \"if they got this near as soon as, they'll strive once more.\"\n\"I'll take care of the guards,\" Arin said, already turning to leave. \"This won't move unanswered.\"\nSophia arrived as they were getting ready to act, her face pallid and her markings barely shining. \"What's going on?\" she said, her voice filled with dread.\n\"A struggle for Tharros' existence,\" Kael stated frankly. \"We're coping with it.\"\nSophia's eyes widened, and her attention shifted to Tharros. \"Are you okay?\"\n\"I'm fine,\" Tharros said in a quieter tone than before. \"but this changes matters.\"\nSophia drew closer, her concern palpable. \"How? \"Who might try this?\"\nTharros paused, his jaw hardening. \"That's what we need to discover.\"\nThe council reconvened the next morning, with the surrounds thicker than before. Whispers filled the chamber as details of the assassination attempt emerged. Tensions were high, and belief was scant.\nTharros stood in the center of the room, his golden eyes examining the faces all around him. \"An individual within these divisions granted the assassin access. This was no outsider's assault.\"\nThe council erupted in whispers, and accusations flew between sides. Veylor remained silent, his silver eyes staring at Tharros with disturbing calm.\n\"You can't really trust that one person is accountable,\" a councillor argued. \"Who would benefit from such chaos?\"\n\"Masses could,\" Arin remarked, her voice breaking over the noise. \"Tharros' management isn't without its enemies.\"\n\"Enough,\" Tharros stated, his voice hard. The chamber fell silent immediately. \"This is not a debate. Whoever is accountable can be observed, and they will answer for their actions.\"\nVeylor grinned, sending a shiver through Sophia. \"Ambitious phrases, Tharros.\" Let's hope you can deliver.\"\nAs the conference ended, Tharros pulled Sophia apart, his countenance unreadable. \"I need your help.\"\n\"Me?\" she inquired, amazed.\n\"You're an outsider,\" Tharros said. \"You view things in a different way. If there is a conspiracy, you might say something that the rest of the people ignore.\"\nSophia hesitated, the weight of his request falling on her. \"I'll do what i will.\"\nTharros nodded, his golden gaze softening. \"I believe you.\"\nAs she exited the chamber, her mind raced with questions. Who would want Tharros to be useless? And why now, when Aquaria faces risks far bigger than political competition?\nHer thoughts were interrupted by Kael, who fell in step beside her. \"Be careful,\" he said, his tone critical. \"Whoever did this gained't prevent with Tharros.\"\n\"I recognize,\" Sophia said, her voice steady despite her anxiety. \"but I'm now not backing down.\"\nKael nodded, his admiration for her clear. \"suitable.\"\nThat evening, while Sophia reviewed the day's events in her chambers, a timid rap on the door startled her. She opened it to find a small package deal hidden on the floor, its surface engraved with strange symbols. Her pulse accelerated as she scooped it up; the weight was unexpected.\nInternal transformed into a single shard of blackened coral, its edges rough and sharp. It was accompanied by a warning, written in strong, distinctive script: You do not belong here.\nSophia's breath caught and her grip tightened on the shard. The warning was modified to clean. Instead of fear, she felt an overwhelming sense of dedication.\nWhoever was in the back of this wanted her out. And that became the only reason she wanted to stay.\nThe Truth Beneath\nKael stood on the edge of the reflection Chamber, his normally calm attitude noticeably strained. The flaming seas underneath him reflected the conflict in his heart. Sophia approached, her steps gentle but practical. She had only seen this side of Kael once before, during the conflict at the Coral Gates, when he said something about \"protective more than simply Aquaria.\"\nThe sections appeared to have fallen into area.",

        "content": "\"You've been unusually quiet,\" Sophia replied, her tone soft but curious. \"That's no longer such as you.\"\nKael drew closer to her, his dark blue eyes meeting hers. For a split second, the weight of his wordless reality shifted across his face. \"Sophia,\" he began, his voice hard and hesitant. \"There's something you want to realize.\"\nSophia grimaced and stepped closer. \"Kael, you are terrifying me. \"What's going on?\"\nHe groaned, his massive shoulders rising and falling as if he were bracing himself for impact. \"I have spent years concealing a part of me. Not because I wanted to, but because it made things less difficult-and safer. However, I will no longer disguise it. \"Not now.\nSophia clasped her hands, her heart hammering. \"Then inform me. I will recognize something even if it is far away.\"\nKael hesitated before eventually saying what had been on his mind. \"I am not merely a warrior. I'm a prince, the rightful inheritor of the Mer country.\nThe room appeared to hold its breath. Sophia blinked, unsure if she had heard him clearly. \"You're... royalty?\"\nKael nodded, his face serious. \"i'm. However, it is not as glamorous as it seems. The monarchy comes with chains, Sophia-chains that have hindered me from living a full life. However, with everything going on right now, I can't keep away from them any longer.\"\nSophia's thoughts raced. Will Kael, the stoic and resolute warrior, become a prince? The revelation turned everything she thought she knew about him on its head. \"Why didn't you inform everyone?\" Why now, not Tharros?\"\nKael's jaws constricted. \"Because utilizing it did not define me. I've spent my life as a warrior, demonstrating my worth via movement, not birthright. \"But now...\" His voice softened, and he looked at her with something like vulnerability. \"Now, I see that my silence might have executed more damage than exact.\"\nSophia moved closer, her fingertips brushing against his arm. \"Kael, you have already proven your worth a hundred times over. However, if disclosing this information can benefit us, it is the appropriate action to take.\"\nKael's lips quirked into a tiny smile, and thankfulness shone through his eyes. \"You always realize what to say, don't you?\"\nSophia smiled back, despite her heavy coronary heart. \"someone has to maintain you grounded.\"\nWhen Kael revealed his origins to the council later that day, the reaction was immediate and powerful. A few councilors were taken aback, while others were suspicious and overtly hostile. The voices increased, accusations and questions streaming through the air like arrows.\n\"Why would you keep this from us?\" one elder shouted, her shrill tone fading into the clamor. \"Do you no longer believe the council?\"\n\"Agree with had nothing to do with it,\" Kael responded, his voice steady throughout the tumult. \"I kept my heritage disguised so that I might serve Aquaria without bias. However, given the threats we are facing, my name could perhaps offer us with an advantage.\"\n\"A bonus?\" mocked another councilor. \"Or a liability?\" The Mer nation has not allied with Aquaria in a long time. What makes you believe they will focus on you?\"\nKael's gaze hardened. \"Because I am their prince.\" And I am willing to fight for their agreement.\nTharros, who had remained silent until now, now spoke. His golden eyes were riveted on Kael, inscrutable. \"Do you truly believe you will be granted human beings at the end of this time? Or will going back simply spread more discord?\"\nKael regarded Tharros' eyes without flinching. \"They will accept me because they don't have an option. The Mer nation requires a pacesetter, and I am prepared to take on that responsibility.\"\nTharros was silent for a long moment. Then he nodded, his countenance unreadable. \"thoroughly. But understand this: if your actions endanger Aquaria, prince or not, you will answer to me.\"\nKael tilted his head. \"I wouldn't anticipate some thing much less.\"\nSophia spent the evening in the palace gardens, looking for consolation among the bioluminescent blossoms. The lovely glow of the plant life became calming, but her thoughts shifted to anything but tranquil. Kael's admission had shaken her, not because it altered who he became, but because of the implications for the future.\n\"You're stricken.\"\nThe deep, familiar voice surprised her. She turned to see Tharros emerge from the shadows, his regal presence as intimidating as ever.\n\"Bothered is probably an understatement,\" Sophia conceded. \"Kael's information modifications the whole lot, doesn't it?\"\nTharros nodded, his face thoughtful. \"It does. however not always for the higher.\"\nSophia frowned. \"You don't accept as true with him?\"\n\"It's no longer about trust,\" Tharros explained. \"It is roughly the outcome of his revelation. Energy attracts enemies, Sophia. And now that his pedigree is known, his adversaries will come after him-and us.\"\nThe weight of his words crushed against Sophia's chest. \"Then we'll face them together,\" she said decisively.\nTharros' expression softened slightly, and for a minute, he appeared almost... proud. \"You're more potent than you recognise, Sophia.\"\nShe gave a tiny grin, but her heart remained gloomy. \"I just hope it's enough.\"\nThe periods I observed had been a whirl of preparations. Even as the palace was bustling with activity, Kael prepared for his journey to the Mer kingdom. But beneath the floor, fear bubbled. Whispers of betrayal and risk rang through the halls, and Sophia couldn't shake the feeling that something had gone wrong.\nThat night, as she was reviewing her notes in her chambers, a smooth knock on the door shocked her. She opened it to find a palace messenger with a sealed scroll. The symbol on the seal made her stomach drop-it was from the Mer nation.\nSophia broke the seal with shaky arms and unrolled the sheet. The inner message was simple but chilling:\n\"The prince's return is not welcomed. If he comes, he will share the same end as his predecessors. Don't forget this is your only caution.\"\nHer breath became stopped, and she tightened her grip on the scroll. Who had sent this? And what did this mean for Kael?\nA disturbance in the passageway outside her chambers interrupted her thoughts. She entered the corridor just in time to see a shadowy figure disappear around the corner.\n\"howdy!\" Sophia's voice echoed. She dashed after the discern, her heart thumping. But as she rounded the nook, the corridor became empty, save for the faint sound of footfall receding into the distance.\nThe next morning, Sophia saw Kael within the school corridor, his movements precise and controlled as he sparred with a defense. She waited until he finished before approaching, holding the scroll tightly in her palm.\n\"Kael, we need to speak,\" she continued, her tone firm.\nKael furrowed his brow as he wiped away the sweat. \"what's it?\"\nSophia passed him the scroll. \"This arrived at closing time. \"It comes from the Mer kingdom.\"\nKael read the message, his visage becoming darker with each word. When he finished, he looked up at her with his jaw set. \"They're trying to scare me off.\"\n\"Do you observed it's critical?\" Sophia inquired, her tone tinted with dread.\n\"It doesn't rely,\" Kael insisted firmly. \"I am going, no matter what. My humans want me, whether they know it or not.\nSophia nodded, her heart filled with admiration and fear. \"Then we'll prepare for some thing comes.\"\nKael placed a hand on her shoulder, his touch warm and soothing. \"Thank you, Sophia.\" \"I couldn't do it without you.\"\nAs he returned to the school corridor, Sophia couldn't shake the idea that the warning had become more than just a hazard. As the currents within the palace grew colder, she realized that the trek ahead would test all of them in ways they hadn't anticipated.\nShadows of the Deep\nSophia recalled the warning from the Mer state as she walked the castle later that night. The coral's bioluminescent glow cast solid shifting shadows that appeared alive, whispering secrets and strategies she couldn't hear. She wasn't sure if it was her anxiety or something more sinister, but every creak and flash of light caused her pulse to speed.\nHer steps brought her to the reflection Chamber, a place where she frequently found consolation. However, tonight the chamber was not empty. Arin stood at the edge, her figure sharp against the sparkling ocean. The ocean witch's normal grace seems to have abandoned her, leaving her shoulders sagged and her gaze distant.\nSophia hesitated, but something about Arin's posture drew her forward. \"Couldn't sleep either?\" Sophia inquired quietly.\nArin became, her emerald eyes gleaming like shards of broken glass. For a moment, she said nothing, and Sophia wondered if she should have left her alone. However, Arin nodded in the direction of the water. \"sit with me.\"\nSophia approached gingerly and lowered herself upon the cool stone next her. The silence stretched between them, thick and unspoken. Sophia finally said, \"You appear...exclusive tonight.\"\nArin gave a bitter snigger. \"different is a kind manner of putting it.\"\nSophia tilted her head, examining the girl next her. Arin transformed from her usual cool and furious demeanor. Seeing her like this, vulnerable and exposed, felt like looking behind a curtain she had no idea would be yanked back. \"Do you need to speak approximately it?\"\nFor a long time, it looked that Arin would not respond. But then she spoke, her voice soft and raw. \"Do you already know what it's like to be undesirable?\"\nSophia blinked, taken aback. \"What do you imply?\"\nArin's attention was riveted on the shimmering water, her expression unreadable. \"I was not born with vigor, Sophia. I was not nurtured for greatness. I used to not be anything. \"Much less than nothing.\"\nThe remarks hung in the air, piercing and biting. Sophia drew closer, her attention peaked. \"You are one of the most strong humans I have ever encountered. How could you have been nothing?\nArin pulled his lips into a bitter smile. \"Energy does not come from luxury, Sophia. It stems from an aching. From being solid, crushed, and left to rot. My parents-if you could call them that-bought me into the Shark Clans when I was only old enough to swim.\"\nSophia's breath caught. \"Sold you?\" Why?\"\n\"Money owed,\" Arin said bluntly. \"My father gambled away everything we owned, and when the creditors arrived, he offered me as a charge. They did not even hesitate.\"\nSophia glanced at her with horror. \"That's... immense.\"\nArin's smile turned somber. \"That's life in the trenches, Sophia. The Sharks do not care about innocence or justice. They care about power. They saw possibility in me-potential to be molded, twisted, and used.\"\nSophia had a wave of rage on Arin's behalf. \"How did you continue to exist?\"\nArin's gaze eventually met Sophia's, and the raw pain in her eyes caused her chest to clench. \"I didn't just live to tell the story, Sophia. I thrived. They requested a weapon, therefore I became one. I discovered their charm, suggestions, and harshness. And while I was strong enough, I grew to embody it all for them.\"\nSophia's heart hammered as she thought the atrocities Arin had to have endured. \"You escaped?\"\nArin nodded, her jaw tightened. \"I didn't suddenly break out. I destroyed them. Every absolute one of them. By the time I was finished, the Shark Clans understood not to move me.\"\nThe hush that followed became deafening. Sophia strained to find the perfect words, but nothing seemed appropriate. Finally, she said, \"I am sorry you had to go through that.\"\nArin shrugged, but her eyes revealed a spark of vulnerability. \"Do not be. \"It made me who I am.\"\nThey sat in quiet for a while, the weight of Arin's story settling on them like a thick fog. Sophia eventually broke the stillness. \"Why are you telling me this now?\"\nArin paused, then sighed. \"Because I see a lot of myself in you. Sophia, you are stronger than you realize, but strength may be a double-edged blade. It can protect you or isolate you.\nSophia frowned. \"I don't want to be isolated.\"\n\"Then be cautious,\" Arin advised, her tone softening. \"The more power you have, the more people will strive to steal it from you. They will betray, use, and harm you. And if you don't exercise caution, you'll end up like me-closed off and alone.\"\nSophia shakes her head. \"You're not alone anymore, Arin. \"You've got us.\"\nArin's lips curved into a slight smile. \"maybe. \"For now.\"\nAs the night progressed, their discourse turned to lighter topics-Aquarian politics, Kael's voyage, and Tharros' attitude. However, beneath the surface, Sophia couldn't ignore the feeling that Arin's narrative had become more than just a cautionary tale. It converted to a warning.\nWhile Sophia eventually returned to her chambers, the weight of the night weighed against her chest. She had just gotten into bed when an unexpected knock on the door shook her awake.\nHer heart raced as she opened the door and saw a palace guard, his face faded. \"Dr. Rodriguez, you're needed in the council room. Now.\"\nSophia grabbed her robe and followed the defend into the darkened corridors. When they arrived, she saw Tharros, Kael, and other councilors already assembled, their attitudes dismal.\n\"What's happening?\" Sophia asked, her tone tinged with worry.\nTharros improved, and his golden eyes became tougher. \"There has been an assault. \"A patrol near the Mer kingdom was ambushed.\"\nKael clenched his hands, his rage somewhat restrained. \"This was not at random. They've been conveying a message.\nSophia's stomach churned. \"What type of message?\"",

        "content": "Tharros passed her a scrap of parchment, the ink smeared but legible. It reads: The prince is not welcome. Turn again or face the consequences.\nSophia's blood was bloodless. She gazed at Kael, who matched her gaze with such determination that her heart ached. \"We can't ignore this,\" he insisted strongly.\n\"No,\" Tharros concurred. \"However, we cannot enter blindly. \"We want a plan.\"\nSophia couldn't shake the feeling that disaster was on its way after the council began strategizing. The shadows Arin had mentioned appeared to be the last to arrive, and he or she wondered how long they could keep them away.\nLater, after the conference ended, Arin approached Sophia inside the corridor. \"Be careful,\" she advised, her voice low. \"The deeper you pass, the darker it gets.\"\nSophia looked at her with a question on her lips, but Arin had already walked away, her vision obscured by the swirling shadows.\nSophia stood alone for a minute, the weight of their enemies-and secrets-on her shoulders. As the lighting flickered in the distance, she realized that the darkness was far closer than she had anticipated.\nMaelstrom of Fate\nThe tension in the air became tangible when Sophia, Kael, Arin, and Tharros convened within the mirrored image Chamber the next day. Each of them bore the burden of their personal fights, but now they were united by a single goal: to test the strength of their combined abilities.\nTharros stood in the center, his golden eyes glittering with a faint electricity. \"We want to know what we're capable of,\" he said, his tone dominating. \"If we're going to face what's coming, we should paintings together.\"\nKael nodded, his expression determined. \"But we don't even understand how our abilities interact. \"What if it backfires?\"\nArin smirked, her confidence a sharp contrast to Kael's discomfort. \"Is that the factor? To explore what happens when we cease holding our lower back.\"\nSophia's eyes moved between them, her heart thumping. She wasn't sure which scared her more: the unknown or the sheer energy seething just beneath the floor. \"Let's simply make certain we're careful,\" she said, her voice steady despite her anxiety.\nTharros advanced and extended his hand. \"We will start small. Focus on the relationship. Allow the energy to flow obviously.\"\nThey connected their fingers one by one to make a circle. The air around them became heavy, packed with a force that made the water ripple beneath their feet. Sophia felt a warmth sweep through her, an unusual yet soothing sensation that seemed to boost her own power.\nInitially, it became diffused-a gentle hum vibrating across the chamber. However, when their abilities united, the electricity became more intense and unstable. The currents around them began to swirl, and their velocity increased with each passing second.\n\"This feels... one of a kind,\" Sophia said, her voice tinted with amazement. She should feel the essence of each of them-Tharros' fire, Kael's manipulation, and Arin's mysticism-all combined with her own hydrokinesis.\n\"Consciousness,\" Tharros suggested, tightening his hold. \"Do not combat it. Let it guide you.\"\nSophia closed her eyes, giving in to the drift of strength. It became exciting, much like riding a wave that refused to break. However, as the energy increased, it became difficult to manipulate and contain.\n\"I suppose we're pushing too a long way!\" Kael shouted, his voice straining.\nArin's eyes twinkled with defiance. \"Or maybe we're no longer pushing far sufficient.\"\nBefore everyone could respond, the intensity had reached a breaking point. A deafening roar filled the chamber as a gigantic whirlpool formed underneath them, its force cutting through the water at unfathomable speed.\nThe whirlpool accelerated quickly, causing shockwaves throughout the palace. Fixtures collapsed, walls split, and bioluminescent crystals flared ominously. Guards surged inside the chamber, only to be thrown lower back by the relentless currents.\n\"spoil the connection!\" Tharros yelled, his voice barely audible amid the tumult.\nSophia attempted to allow pass, but her fingers would not move. The power pulled them together in a grip that was both scary and unyielding. \"I can't!\" she exclaimed, terror rising in her breast.\nKael gritted his teeth, his muscles straining as he fought the force. \"It feeds off of us! \"The more we withstand, the stronger it becomes!\"\nArin's expression altered from confident to worried. \"This is not simply electricity; it is something else. \"Something alive.\"\nThe whirlpool erupted again, its draw growing stronger. The chamber dividers began to buckle, with the ancient stone moaning beneath the pressure. Sophia felt herself being carried toward the vortex, with the power threatening to tear her apart.\n\"We have to give up this!\" Tharros screamed, his voice filled with desperation.\n\"How?\" Sophia responded by shouting back. \"We don't even understand what we've accomplished!\"\nSophia's mind raced as the whirlpool reached its apex. She should have felt her strength spin out of control, but there had been something else-something deeper, underneath the pandemonium. A faint but constant thread of concord weaves through the hurricane.\n\"stop combating it!\" She screamed, her voice cutting through the cacophony. \"We're making it worse!\"\nTharros looked at her, his golden eyes flashing. \"What are you pronouncing?\"\n\"consider me!\" Sophia stated, her voice firm despite the dread gnawing at her. \"Allow pass.\" absolutely.\"\nKael hesitated as his grip tightened. \"That's insane!\"\n\"It's the only way!\" Sophia insisted. \"just consider me!\"\nFor a time, there was nothing but the roar of the whirlpool. Then, individually, they let go of their resistance, submitting to the wave of energy. The change became instantaneous. The whirlpool slowed, its ferocious pull turning into a smooth swirl.\nSophia felt an eerie serenity rush over her, as the chaotic force reworked into something... breathtaking. The currents flowed around them, shining with a light that seemed to pulse in sync with their hearts.\n\"It's... stabilizing,\" Kael remarked, his voice filled with skepticism.\nTharros nodded, his look a mix of comfort and amazement. \"We're in control.\"\nFor a few minute, they stood there, amazed at the sheer electricity they'd unleashed. However, the peace was short-lived. From the depths of the swirl, a darkish form emerged.\nThe figure climbed slowly, its outline indistinct but undeniably humanoid. Sophia's breath caught as she saw it take shape-a thing of shadow and water, its eyes glittering with an eerie blue light.\n\"what's that?\" Kael muttered, barely audible.\nArin's face hardened. \"hassle.\"\nThe figure walked forward, its actions precise and purposeful. While speaking, its voice became deep and resonant, much like the crashing of waves. \"You have awakened the currents of the deep. \"Do you already know what you've completed?\"\nTharros stepped forward, defiant. \"who're you?\"\nThe being's attention shifted toward him, its blazing eyes narrowing. \"I am the Keeper of the Abyss. Also, you are trespassers.\"\nSophia's heart hammered as the Keeper's words hit home. \"We didn't imply to-\"\n\"Reason is inappropriate,\" the Keeper said, his tone frigid. \"The currents you've disrupted are historical and sacred. \"You have no right to wield such power.\"\nTharros tightened his fists, golden eyes burning. \"We want to defend Aquaria. If that means using electricity, then so be it.\nThe Keeper tilted its head, leaving its expression unreadable. \"Strength without know-how is destruction. And destruction is all you'll transmit.\"\nBefore all of us could respond, the Keeper lifted its hand. The whirlpool sprang to life once more, its force drawing them closer to the centre. Sophia felt herself sliding as the energy overwhelmed her senses.\n\"maintain on!\" Kael yelled, seizing her arm.\nTharros and Arin battled against the draw, their combined might barely sufficient to keep them grounded. However, the Keeper's strength was unstoppable, and its motivation was apparent.\n\"This isn't over,\" Tharros muttered, his voice filled with determination.\n\"No,\" the Keeper agreed, keeping its luminous eyes fixed on them. \"It has only just all started.\"\nWith one last burst of intensity, the whirlpool collapsed, leaving them gasping and dazed on the chamber floor. When Sophia looked up, the Keeper had vanished, but its caution lingered in the air like a shadow.\nAs they got to their feet, the reality of what had happened began to sink in. They'd tapped into something far greater than themselves-something they didn't fully realize. And now they had been marked.\n\"What the hell was that?\" Kael demanded, his voice quivering with rage and dread.\n\"The Keeper of the Abyss,\" Arin stated, her tone harsh. \"A father or mother of historical magic.\" And it is not pleased with us.\nTharros' jaw stiffened, and his golden eyes darkened with rage. \"Then we'll make them happy. \"Or we will ruin it.\"\nSophia shivered, but the Keeper's gaze remained vivid in her consciousness. \"We want to be careful. Whatever we have awakened... it will no longer allow us to cross.\"\nThe chamber grew silent, the weight of their movements pressing down on them. Sophia couldn't shake the impression that their true war had only just begun, as the flickering light of the crystals created dancing shadows over the walls.\nDark Omens\nA mirrored image The Chamber of Aquaria was a haven of serenity, a sanctuary where currents flowed quietly and bioluminescent coral formed gentle, shimmering lighting fixtures along the walls. However, something had changed overnight. The water hummed with unsaid tension, and the coral's glow had developed into vivid blues and vegetables that pulsed in unusual patterns.\nSophia stood by the chamber's side, watching as incredible patterns rippled across the floor of the deep pool. The currents carried faint echoes, unsettling whispers in a language she didn't understand. They began to weave together, creating an ancient chant that chilled her blood.\n\"What's causing this?\" she said, her voice shaking.\nTharros strolled beside her, his eyes fixed on the pool. His golden eyes danced with the scenario. \"This hasn't happened in centuries,\" he stated calmly. \"The reflection Chamber is meant to be an area of readability, not chaos.\"\nBefore Sophia could react, Arin entered the chamber, her countenance unreadable. She strode purposefully, her dark hair trailing behind her like a shadow. Her fingers held a little crystal sphere that shimmered slightly.\n\"It's all started,\" Arin remarked, her voice steady but full of significance.\nTharros grew sharp with her. \"What do you suggest?\"\nArin knelt by the pool, lowering the ball into the water. The brilliance in the chamber appeared to intensify, with the unusual styles moving violently. Arin closed her eyes and uttered a whispered incantation. The currents became strained and spiraled around the pool in erratic patterns.\nThe sphere began to pulse, and within moments, snap photos appeared on its surface-fragmented, hazy, like fragments from a shattered duplicate. A gigantic form coiled in the depths, barely visible but clearly dangerous. Sparkling eyes pierced the darkness, sending shivers down Sophia's spine.\n\"It's the Leviathan,\" Arin said, her voice just above a whisper. \"It stirs within the depths.\"\nThe council room became tense when the institution reconvened. The fractured picture had upset them all, and the room was suddenly filled with argumentative voices.\n\"How can we even recognize that is real?\" One councilor insisted, his fins twitching with excitement. \"Visions may simply be hallucinations. We can't make decisions based largely on shadows.\nArin's eyes blazed with rage. \"These are not just shadows. Traditionally, the reflected image Chamber served as a conduit for reality. The leviathan's stirring is not a hypothesis; it is a fact.\"\nSome other councillor scoffed. \"The truth? Based on what? \"A glowing pool and an orb?\"\nTharros lifted his hand, halting the argument. His demeanor turned stern. \"sufficient. We do not have the luxury of rejecting this. Whether you believe in the imaginative and prescient or not, we cannot ignore the symptoms. The oceans have been pressured for weeks, and the Shark Clans' actions are the most effective addition to the threat.\"\nSophia observed the exchange with her mind racing. The inventive and prescient had severely disturbed her, but she couldn't shake the suspicion that there had been more to it than prophecy. Technology and common sense had always been her basis, and now that she was confronted with something so perplexing, she felt compelled to discover answers.\n\"Maybe I can help interpret it,\" she said, her voice lowering in the tense pause.\nAll eyes focused on her, some interested, others doubtful.\n\"You?\" One councilor inquired, his tone uncertain. \"You are a scientist. What about visions and magic?\"\nSophia straightened her shoulders and refused to back down. \"I understand how to study patterns and find meaning where others see chaos. If there is something to understand, I will find it.\"\nTharros nodded. \"Do whatever you have to, Sophia. However, be cautious. No longer is all magic intended to be comprehended.\"\nSophia spent the next several hours in the palace's archive, surrounded by ancient manuscripts and schematics that seemed to blur the line between delusion and fact. Arin joined her, despite the apparent hostility between them.\n\"You believe you studied and can explain magic with technological know-how,\" Arin said skeptically as she turned through a tattered tome.\n\"I assume magic and science are more linked than we realise,\" Sophia replied, no longer looking up from the papers she was typing. \"There is a common sense to everything. We just need to find it.\"\nArin smirked, her demeanor softening slightly. \"That is a positive way of looking at it. However, not all things can be measured or quantified.\n\"Maybe,\" Sophia conceded. \"but that doesn't suggest we shouldn't try.\"\nThey poured over the texts together, their disagreements resulting in a tenuous cooperation. Sophia sketched out the styles she had seen within the Reflection Chamber, cross-referencing them with information on beyond disturbances in Aquaria. Meanwhile, Arin performed old incantations, hoping to glean some meaning from the leviathan's awakening.\nAs the hours passed, the sections began to fall into place. The currents, visions, and commonplace phenomena all pointed to one obvious conclusion: the leviathan was more than merely stirring. It was awaking.\nThat night, Sophia returned to the reflection Chamber alone, unable to shake the weight of their discoveries. The water had calmed down, and the styles had faded, but the air still felt heavy, as if the room itself had stopped breathing.\nSophia knelt beside the pool, her hands caressing the floor. The water grew less warm than before, almost frigid, and as she gazed into its depths, she was drawn into a trance-like realm.\nThe area around her decreased, giving way to an absolute darkness that appeared to press against her. Then she noticed them: bright eyes, huge and unblinking, staring at her from the abyss.\nA low, guttural voice boomed through the darkness, each sentence echoing deeply within her. \"The abyss hungers.\"\nSophia gasped, her breath caught in her throat. The vision shifted, the eyes fading into the abyss, and she fell, sinking in a sea of bloodlessness and worry.\nShe awoke with a start, her body shivering. The chamber fell silent, yet the water around her turned abnormally bloodless, sending chills down her veins.\nThe Leviathan's words lingered in her consciousness, a terrible reminder of what was to come. Is it a warning, or a summons?\nShark Clans Rise\nThe council chamber has become a cyclone of panic and discontent. Reviews of shark fighters patrolling Aquaria's borders had sparked unrest among the majority of the leaders. The undertone of dread was palpable, reverberating around the room as furious voices collided.\n\"Do you observed this is just a caution?\" Councilor Merik's voice became fierce, and his eyes darted around the table. \"This is a chance.\" A brazen one. \"The Shark Clans are preparing for conflict!\"\nAnother councilor, a slim man with white hair, leaned forward. \"So, what will we do? Wait for them to strike? This could be our simplest hazard to act preemptively.\"\nTharros stood at the head of the table, his commanding presence silencing the audience. His golden eyes were filled with silent rage as he said. \"We no longer wait, and we will not allow them to dictate terms. If the Shark Clans require a fight, we will give them one.\"\nHis announcement sent murmurs through the chamber, with some nodding in agreement and others obviously apprehensive. Kael, sat next to Tharros, lifted his hand to indicate quiet.\n\"With admire,\" Kael stated evenly, \"attacking now may be gambling into their arms. The Shark Clans are masters of misdirection. If they're displaying themselves so shamelessly, it's intentional. \"They want us to act rashly.\"\nTharros spoke to him, his voice slashing. \"So we don't do anything? Allow them to continue advancing on our territory?\n\"We circulate cautiously,\" Kael replied, avoiding Tharros' ferocious stare. \"Recklessness will value us lives we are able to't manage to pay for to lose.\"\nSophia watched the interaction from the back of the room, her chest straining from the tension between them. The stakes had never been higher, and their alliance's fragile stability seemed on the edge of unraveling.\nShe took a step forward, her voice firm yet steady. \"What if we accumulate greater statistics earlier than making any decisions?\"\nThe room fell silent, and all eyes focused on her. Tharros' frown softened slightly as he saw her. \"What do you suggest?\"\nSophia looked at Kael, finding reassurance in his steady presence. \"A reconnaissance mission. If we can discover their true objectives, we will be in a better position to respond. Kael, and I ought to lead it.\"\nKael nodded, his lips twisting into a little smile. \"She's correct. I recognise their approaches. If everyone can figure out what they're planning, it's us.\"\nTharros stopped, his mouth clenched as he considered the risks. Then he gave a pointed nod. \"fine. But be cautious. We can't find the money to lose any of you.\"\nThe waters around Aquaria's boundaries have grown darker, colder, and strangely silent. The palace's vibrant illumination seemed like a distant memory as Sophia and Kael led a small group through the murky depths. The silence became oppressive, interrupted only by the odd movement of currents around them.\n\"Stay close,\" Kael said, his voice low. He moved with accustomed grace, his sharp eyes probing the shadows for signs of movement.\nSophia followed with her senses on full alert. Each flicker of light, every ripple of water sent her heart racing. \"Do you sense that?\" she inquired softly.\nKael nodded. \"The currents are strong right here. \"Just as the water preserves its breath.\"\nThey swam gingerly, their dread growing with every passing second. The gang spread out, their weapons ready, but even the smallest sound seemed deafening in the hush.\n\"Hold,\" Kael replied unexpectedly, raising one hand. The organization froze up, their movements perfectly coordinated. His gaze narrowed, focusing on the shadows ahead. \"some thing's there.\"\nA figure came from the darkness. It transformed into a shark warrior, his towering frame covered in jagged armor inscribed with blazing runes. His black eyes gleamed with hatred as he approached, his movements fluent and methodical.",

        "content": "\"Stay again,\" Kael warned, moving forward to protect Sophia and the others.\nThe warrior paused a few yards away, tilting his head as if sizing them up. His lips curved up into a nasty grin. \"You shouldn't be right here.\"\n\"Let's imagine the equal to you,\" Kael said carelessly. \"What are your clans planning?\"\nThe warrior chuckled, deep and guttural. \"you suspect I'd proportion our plans with you, prince?\"\nSophia's breath caught at the name. She looked at Kael, whose expression clouded. \"How do you know who i am?\"\n\"I understand many things,\" the warrior remarked, his tone scornful. \"The abyss whispers to people who listen.\"\nSophia felt a calming sensation travel down her spine. \"The abyss?\" \"What does that imply?\"\nThe warrior's attention went to her, and his grin faltered briefly. \"You should leave while you still can. There are forces at work right here, much beyond your knowledge.\"\nKael tightened his hold on the weapon, his voice low and deadly. \"If you know something, please tell us. Now.\"\nThe warrior paused, strengthening his hold on the blade at his aspect. For a second, it appeared that he may assault. However, he took a step back, his grin returning. \"You'll find out soon enough.\"\nBefore anyone could respond, he dashed by them, disappearing into the shadows. His final words echoed throughout the water: \"The abyss hungers.\" \"And it will consume you all.\"\nBy the time they return to Aquaria, the burden of the encounter has become heavy on each person's shoulders. The council reconvened immediately, its initial terror replaced by grim resolve as Kael and Sophia realized what had occurred.\nTharros leaned in, his golden gaze piercing. \"He noticed the abyss. \"What do you think he meant?\"\nKael shakes his head. \"It is tough to mention. However, the Shark Clans behave with purpose. It is no longer appropriate for them to align with anything from the abyss.\"\n\"And the runes on his armor?\" Councilor Merik inquired. \"Did you apprehend them?\"\n\"No,\" Kael confessed. \"But they didn't feel right. As if they did not belong on this planet.\"\nSophia remained quiet, her mind repeating the experience over and over. The warrior's look, the way he examined her-it turned into as if he had seen something in her that even she did not understand.\nAfter the assembly was over, she found herself alone with Kael in the palace grounds. The soothing glow of the bioluminescent plants did little to alleviate her discomfort.\n\"You're quiet,\" Kael said, his tone pleasant.\nSophia groaned and crossed her fingers. \"Just thinking about what he said. Approximately the abyss. Have you noticed it's related to the visions we've been having?\"\nKael paused, his jaw stiffening. \"It is viable. The abyss has always been more than just a place; it is a pressure. One that should not be disturbed.\"\nSophia frowned. \"So, why did he study me like that? As if he knew something I didn't.\nKael winced and clutched his arm, perhaps before he could answer. \"What the-\"\nSophia's eyes widened as glowing symbols began to emerge on his pores and skin, throbbing slightly with blue light. \"Kael, your arm!\"\nHe looked at the marks in bewilderment, his breathing unsteady. \"I do not comprehend. These were not here earlier.\"\nSophia reached out, her arms brushing across the odd symbols. They had been warm and nearly alive. \"Do they harm?\"\nKael shook his head, but his expression remained concerned. \"No. But I can sense... something. \"As if they are linked to me.\"\nSophia's stomach lurched as she drew her hand back. \"What does it suggest?\"\nKael returned her glance, his eyes full with apprehension. \"I do not know. However, I have a sense that this is only the beginning.\"\nRifts and Alliances\nThe huge hall of Aquaria's council was alive with voices, the air thick with tension. Delegates from adjacent underwater kingdoms, formerly allies and friends, had arrived under a shadow of distrust. Their features were chilly, their eyes calculated, and their words-once warm and welcoming-felt sharp and full of distrust.\nSophia stood near the entrance, watching the sea of dignitaries mix in a rare display of unity. She emphasized the exchange's attitude, how the normal greetings had given way to formal nods and measured grins. The sensation of camaraderie she had felt most effective weeks before now seemed distant, almost unreal.\nTharros walked at the head of the corridor, his presence as imposing as always, yet he seemed uneasy with the assistance of the developing department. Kael turned into speaking to a group of warriors inside the nook, his posture stiff as he listened intently. Sophia's thoughts returned to the amazing marks she'd seen on Kael's arm-the symbols flashing faintly with an electricity she couldn't entirely comprehend. It unnerved her, giving her the impression that they were all being tugged in different directions by invisible forces.\nAs the delegates took their seats, Sophia noticed Arin near the back of the room. She was standing by herself, her gaze surveying the crowd. Despite the impression of authority she exuded, there was fragility in her posture, a subtle tightness in the way her fingers held the borders of her robe.\nThe gathering began, and Tharros took his place at the table. He greeted the visitors with his usual calm, but even his words felt heavy, strained. The issues at hand were serious: the Shark Clans' growing aggression, the unknown menace from the abyss, and the fragile peace that Aquaria had worked so hard to maintain.\n\"We're all on the same side,\" Tharros said, his voice reverberating throughout the chamber. \"The Shark Clans pose a risk to all of us.\" We must act as one if we are to preserve our way of life.\nSophia's attention shifted as she watched Arin once more. Her eyes met Arin's, and for a brief moment, she glimpsed the glimmer of something unspoken. Arin's look was unreadable, but Sophia could sense the weight of it.\nThen the major voice cut through the anxiousness, reducing the air like a knife.\n\"Are we without a doubt meant to simply accept that the very girl who conjured darkness to interrupt free from the Shark Clans now sits on the table as an ally?\" A tall, broad-shouldered man with dark blue scales scowled from the other end of the table. Volgar, a delegate from the Kraken Isles, was one of Aquaria's closest allies.\nSophia felt her heart skip a beat. She knew the political tides had shifted, but she hadn't expected this. Volgar's words were an immediate attack on Arin, and the charge stung.\n\"You may not be serious,\" Arin remarked, her voice full of harm and wrath. \"I've performed nothing but combat to protect this country.\"\nVolgar's bloodless eyes remained fixed on her. \"But your magic is derived from the very forces we've long struggled to contain. There are stories, whispers, that you carry gloom with you wherever you go.\"\nThe room became hushed, the anxiety apparent. The opposing delegates exchanged apprehensive glances. It became evident that Volgar was speaking not only for himself, but also for many others who were concerned about Arin's outcast status.\nArin clinched her fists, her black eyes sparkling with a fierceness that commanded everyone's attention. \"You could call it darkness, but I've used my magic to protect this kingdom.\" You must be grateful and no longer afraid.\nSophia improved, and her voice became more regular as she spoke. \"Arin has accomplished nothing except defend Aquaria. She's faced fights that many of us would have avoided.\"\nHer statements appeared to divert some of the hatred in the room, but Volgar was not discouraged.\n\"And what of the leviathan?\" He demanded, his voice rising. \"What about the abyssal energies seething within the depths? Are we to consider someone with that level of electricity?\"\nThe room moved when the Leviathan was mentioned. Sophia felt a frigid shudder run through her as memories of their final encounter with the ancient beast reappeared. The words \"The abyss hungers\" rang in her mind.\n\"Enough,\" Tharros said, his voice forceful. He rose from his desk, golden eyes sweeping the room. \"We're not here to accuse, but to unite. We've all seen the reviews. The Shark Clans are militarizing. They are combining with powers far darker than anyone has ever encountered. We can't afford to pay for these minor squabbles.\nKael went forward, his calm demeanor contrasted with the rising anxiousness. \"Tharros is correct. Now is not the time for old grievances. The Shark Clans are on the move, and they may not hesitate to strike. We must prepare.\"\nA murmur of agreement swept through the room, but the damage was done. The seeds of distrust had been planted, and it was clear that old alliances would be thoroughly examined.\nSophia could feel the weight of the moment bearing down on her. She looked at Arin, whose face had softened slightly, but the harm was still glaring in her eyes. Arin had been an outcast for a long time, fighting for a place in Aquaria that was never really hers. And now, the same worry that had driven her into the shadows appeared to be pushing her back.\nAs the delegates argued quietly, Sophia moved to Arin's side. \"They're wrong,\" she said quietly. \"You've validated yourself time and time again.\"\nArin gave her a faint, grateful smile. \"perhaps. but the greater I prove myself, the greater they worry me.\"\nSophia didn't know how to respond. The fear became real-she might want to see it in the delegates' eyes, in the way their shoulders tensed when Arin spoke. but there was something more she couldn't quite describe, a deeper layer of suspicion and hatred that appeared to have taken root in Aquaria's leadership.\nThe council assembly dragged on, replete with heated discussions, accusations, and ideas that went nowhere. Tharros strove to maintain the peace, but it became obvious that the cracks of their concord had been expanding.\nHours later, because the delegates began to go, Sophia stayed within the chamber, her thoughts racing. She had been inside the heart of Aquaria long time to know that everything had been about to come apart. The Shark Clans' hostility become one difficulty, however the splits within their personal management were some other.\nKael approached her slowly, his face a masque of effort. \"Are you all proper?\"\nSophia shook her head, the heaviness of everything urgent down on her. \"I don't recognise. It appears like we're losing manage.\"\nKael placed a hand on her shoulder, his contact warm yet forceful. \"We'll keep it together. We ought to.\"\nbefore Sophia could reply, a disturbance erupted near to the doorway. A guy, soaking wet in seawater, came into the room, his breathing ragged.\n\"A spy,\" one of the guards cried, running ahead to hold him.\nSophia and Kael grew to witness the man-a frail, shaking discern-being brought into the center of the room. His eyes were wide with fear, his garments ripped, and his pores and skin tattooed with bizarre, dark patterns.\n\"I... I didn't imply to,\" the spy mumbled, struggling to face the guards. \"They... dispatched me. To disrupt peace talks. I am now not... \"I am not one of them.\"\nTharros moved forward, his gaze bloodless. \"Who despatched you?\"\nThe secret agent gasped, his gaze moving uneasily between the council contributors. \"I used to be suspected of disrupting the negotiations. They require the peace to fail... the Shark Clans... the abyss...\"\nThe secret agent's frame stiffened, his eyes bursting with dread, before he should have died. With one last anguished cry, he sank to the floor, holding his chest. His hands twitched just as his body convulsed, and he detonated with one final, deadly burst of dark strength. The power of the blast sent everyone stumbling lower back, the air thick with the bitter smell of burning flesh.\nA blackened coral shard hit the ground, glittering faintly as it settled some of the debris.\nSophia gasped, her heart pounding. The shard... it was the same symbol she had seen etched into Kael's arm.\n\"The abyss,\" Tharros said, his voice a dismal whisper. \"It's right here.\"",

        "content": "Bound by Fire and Water\nThe sound of water slicing through the air filled the cavern as Sophia and Kael exercised their hydrokinesis. The learning environment became secluded, concealed from prying eyes, with the simplest light coming from the herbal glow of bioluminescent animals. Her movements were precise yet unstable, the water around her making jagged shapes as she battled to contain the strength within her.\n\"consciousness, Sophia,\" Kael's voice was calm but firm, and his gaze was focused on her. He glided fluidly, exhibiting the swish dance of water manipulation, which is both a warrior's art and a skill. \"You ought to command the water, no longer let it control you.\"\nSophia breathed sharply, pushing the water aside as she targeted again, attempting to mimic his movements. She became increasingly irritated with each failed attempt. The water swirled about her, responding with chaotic unpredictability, its power too wild to contain.\n\"I'm trying!\" she exclaimed, frustration building in her chest. She looked over at Kael, whose expression was impassive. \"This isn't as clean as it looks.\"\nKael smiled briefly, an unusual expression for him. \"not anything really worth studying is easy.\"\nSophia rolled her eyes and huffed. \"not certain I agree with that proper now.\"\nKael drew closer, his posture flexible and his body a reflection of the water's beat. \"here. Allow me to display you once more.\" His arms lifted, and the water around them complied, producing a truly beautiful spiral. \"You need to feel the current and how it flows. Your frame should be in sync with it.\"\nSophia looked intently as Kael handled the water, his movements seemed opportune, almost as if he and the water were one creature. She felt the heat of his presence alongside her, his confidence unshakable. The contrast between them became striking: her raw, undeveloped potential and his mastery of the element.\n\"I'm not you anymore, Kael,\" she whispered quietly, lowering her hands in defeat. \"I do not have control over it. I don't understand how you make things appear so clean.\"\nKael's gaze softened, and for a brief moment, the gravity of the situation seemed to rise. \"You'll,\" he murmured, his voice more compassionate than usual. \"It takes time, Sophia.\" \"But you've already come a long way.\"\nSophia nodded but did not feel reassured. The energy inside her transformed into a gift and a curse, which she couldn't completely control. The disappointment burned in her chest, and he or she felt a need for something she couldn't define-manipulation, balance, and serenity.\nLater, the sparring consultation began. As Kael and Sophia squared off, the schoolroom deep within Aquaria's core transformed into a large area reverberating with the sound of fighting. They've been practicing their combat methods, with Kael demonstrating her protective moves, how to exploit the drift of water to her advantage, and how to depict the flow of a battle. She was making progress, but the growing anxiety in her chest felt heavier than the vigor of the combat.\nKael moved first, bridging the gap between them with quickness. He turned around her in a seamless motion, pushing her into a defensive stance and compelling her to react. Sophia parried the blow, but the force of the water around them became more intense as her emotions surged. She battled to regain consciousness, her hand reflexively moving to deflect another attack.\nHowever, this time, something became unique. The water around her surged in response to her heightened emotions, and an unwanted energy burst from her palms, slamming with Kael's chest. The pressure propelled him sliding backward, smacking into the stone wall with a loud bang.\n\"Kael!\" Sophia gasped and rushed towards him, her heart pumping in her chest. She knelt beside him, her palms quivering as she examined for signs of harm.\nKael muttered, forcing himself up with a grimace, his chest rising and falling quickly. \"I'm excellent,\" he responded, though his voice was strained. \"It's no longer the first time I've been knocked down.\"\nSophia's chest tightened with guilt. \"I didn't imply to-I misplaced manage.\"\nKael placed a hand on her shoulder to steady her. \"You're not the only one who's ever lost control, Sophia. It is part of the technique.\"\nShe nodded, but the guilt gnawed at her. \"I in no way wanted to hurt everybody.\"\nKael relaxed his gaze, but his grip on her shoulder remained strong. \"You did not damage me. You simply need to learn to control your strength.\" He stood and wiped himself off, wincing slightly as he shifted his stance. \"The truth which you didn't strike me down is progress.\"\nSophia took a long breath, hoping to relax herself. She despised feeling this way, as if her feelings endangered everyone around her. She needed to investigate manipulation. Not only for her sake, but for everyone's.\nLater that day, when the sun set and the water turned golden, Tharros came across Sophia sitting on the edge of a pool in the education section. He approached slowly, his footsteps muffled in the moist stone room.\n\"You're right here,\" he stated quietly and consistently.\nSophia looked up, assembling his golden gaze. \"I couldn't prevent thinking about it.\"\nTharros sat alongside her, his presence as firm as always. \"Kael will do excellent. He is a warrior. \"The pressure you applied to him was insufficient to seriously injure him.\"\n\"I know,\" Sophia muttered. \"However, it wasn't all about him. I'm afraid of what my power can do. \"What it will do.\"\nTharros stared at her, his countenance opaque. \"That's why you want area.\"\nSophia met his harsh gaze. \"I am trying. I don't know if I can.\n\"you could.\" Tharros' voice was firm, but there was something softer beneath it, something that touched her. \"However, you'll want more than simply power. You will require cognition.\"\nSophia learned to be able to stand up to him fully, with her vulnerability propelling her forward. \"I want help.\"\nTharros stood and extended his hand. \"Then come with me.\"\nThe volcanic vent became a haven of seclusion, nestled deep beneath Aquaria's volcanic landscape. It was a place where only the most disciplined could teach, where the raw electricity of a fireplace and water met under unremitting pressure. The recent, sulfurous air became thicker, and the ground shook with the earth's warm current.\nSophia stood behind Tharros, peering into the shimmering fractures in the ground. The intense heat of the vent seems to nourish the burning willpower within her chest.\n\"This is how I learned to manipulate my fireplace,\" Tharros said, his voice firm despite the heat. \"This is a land of extremes. You must find ways to center yourself amidst chaos.\"\nSophia nodded, but she may want to feel the weight of the moment's decision. This was more than just physical education. This was a check on her very essence.\nAs they walked deeper down the vent, Tharros began to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of manipulation, showing her how to ground oneself and center her mind in the midst of turmoil. The water around them bubbled and hissed as the hearth and heat from the vent mixed with the ocean's chilly water. It became a constant conflict between forces, but one that demanded balance, field, and energy.\nSophia concentrated, allowing the warm temperature to surround her, but instead of becoming overwhelmed, she let the warmth permeate into her. The distinction between fire and water grew more apparent to her, and as she gradually began to control her abilities, she felt tied to something deeper than she had previously understood.\nHowever, while they rehearsed, the ground trembled beneath their toes. A deep rumble echoed from the volcanic vents, causing tremors in the air. The earth groaned as molten lava bubbled to the floor, and before they could respond, an unexpected eruption exploded from the vent's center.\n\"Get again!\" Tharros yelled, clutching her arm as they dashed toward the entrance.\nThe heat was terrible, and the floor shifted beneath their feet as the eruption's pressure pushed waves of fire and molten rock toward them. Tharros and Sophia collaborated with a shared appearance, bringing Kael's training to life as they combined their energies. Tharros adjusted the hearth to separate the molten rock, while Sophia used her water to extinguish the flames and cool the ground.\nThey worked flawlessly, pushing against the eruption's force as the lava spread. The disaster was successfully narrowly avoided, but the danger was far from ended.\n\"Appropriate,\" Tharros stated, his voice strained but pleased. \"You've found out some thing vital these days.\"\nSophia nodded, feeling the weight of the celebratory moment. But as she returned to the vent, she saw that something more worse was at work here. The eruption had not been natural. It became an indication of something bigger, more dangerous.\n\"It wasn't just an eruption,\" she explained, her voice shaking with realization. \"This was induced.\"\nTharros became to her, his golden eyes hardened with knowledge. \"The leviathan's influence is growing. And with that comes the opportunity we face.\"\nArin’s Gambit\nThe night became heavy with anticipation, with thick and humid air weighing down on Arin as she scoured the palace library's hidden recesses. Her arms brushed against countless antique manuscripts, their spines cracked and worn from age. But it was not one of the familiar scrolls she wanted. Her gaze searched for something forbidden, a spell deemed most effective by a few-and even fewer dared to say it out.\nShe spent hours flipping over the pages, the library's calm broken only by the delicate rustle of parchment. She felt it-a pull, a whisper that drew her deeper into the darkness of knowing, which she had long avoided. The voice inside her head became clear: that is the greatest way.\nArin's fingertips eventually came to a stop on a webpage that appeared to hum with its own power. The sentences were written in a language she scarcely knew, with old and twisted symbols. It became a prohibited magic, one that she had previously swore she would never touch. But Aquaria was about to dissolve, as the shadow of the leviathan grew closer. The fight between light and darkish became more than just a metaphor; it became real, and it was coming for everyone.\n\"Energy,\" Arin mumbled to herself, her gaze narrowing as she read the ritual. \"It requires a sacrifice.\" Part of the soul... but it will protect the palace from the abyss.\"\nShe closed the e-book, a feeling of worry coming over her. However, the selection had already been made.\nSophia entered the library late that night, expecting to see Arin and discuss the growing tensions between the council and the Shark Clans. She couldn't get rid of the fear that had held her heart as a result of the secret agent's explosion, and she needed to clear her head. Sophia's discomfort increased when she noticed Arin sitting in the farthest nook, her head bent over an antique tome, her countenance unreadable.\n\"You're still up?\" Sophia asked softly, walking towards her.\nArin did not look up immediately. Her eyes were clouded and distant as she did this. \"i discovered something.\"\nSophia's breath became caught. \"What do you suggest?\"\n\"The most useful issue that could defend us now,\" Arin replied, her voice barely a whisper. \"A spell.\" But it's risky. I need your help.\"\nSophia moved closer, her interest piqued despite the fear in the air. \"What type of spell?\"\nArin hesitated before opening the ebook in front of her. \"This one.\" Her fingers traced the delicate symbols. \"A barrier. Strong enough to withstand abyssal forces. However, the ritual is forbidden.\nSophia furrowed her brow. \"Forbidden? Why?\"\nArin's lips stiffened. \"As it requires a sacrifice. It extracts a portion of your soul in return for power. If we get stuck... correctly, we will be labeled as traitors. However, if we don't act immediately, Aquaria will fall.\nSophia's stomach sank. \"This sounds quite risky. \"The council will not permit it.\"\n\"I realize.\" Arin's voice became laced with solve. \"That is why we will not tell them. \"This is the most convenient method.\"\nSophia stood silently, her thoughts whirling. Arin's plea tugged at her, but the consequences were too great. \"But what if it goes wrong?\" What if we lose the ability to manipulate?\nArin met her stare, her face hardened with a combination of determination and terror. \"If we do not accomplish this, the abyss will take us all. We have no separate desires.\"\nSophia took a long breath, attempting to steady her pulse. She had always recognized Arin as walking a nice line between mild and dark, but this was something else entirely. \"You're asking me to interrupt the regulation... for Aquaria.\"\nArin stood, her eyes wide. \"I'm asking you to save it.\"\nThey made their way to the medieval shrine beneath the duvet of night, one of the last places unaffected by time and the relentless march of history. It was concealed deep within Aquaria, where magic flowed freely and the veil between worlds became thinnest. The river became still, the air thick with the scent of salt and dirt, and the stone walls of the shrine pulsed with an unusual electricity.\n\"That is it,\" Arin remarked, her voice echoing in the hole area. She took cautious steps as she neared the altar. A intricate symbol made of coral and bone decorated the ground, and the water surrounding them seemed to shift with unnatural eagerness.\nSophia appeared round, with discomfort creeping up her spine. \"What now?\"\nArin began to chant softly, her voice filled with historical energy as the symbols on the altar began to glow brightly. The air became hotter, and the water, which had been calm minutes earlier, began to ripple in response to her remarks. The magic transitioned into awakening.\nSophia took another step, her expression filled with astonishment and concern. The shrine pulsed with electricity, and the lines between light and dark blurred in front of her eyes. She may wish to sense it-this is no longer merely a spell, but a gateway. A tear inside the fabric of reality itself.\nAs Arin continued the chant, her eyes closed, her body quivering from the strain of channeling such raw electricity, the water surrounding them began to rise, swirling in strange patterns. It was as if the ocean itself was trying to force them back down, rejecting the magic.\nThe floor trembled. A rumble rumbled throughout the temple, and the walls splintered as if the entire structure were being dragged apart. The air had become oppressively dark, and Sophia's heart raced as the shadows within the water deepened.",

        "content": "Arin's voice faltered briefly, but she continued. \"We're nearly there.\"\nSophia's gaze flew about, and panic sprang in her chest. Something became incorrect. The shrine was growing unstable, with the power twisting and warping into something far more terrible than they had expected.\nThen, with a thunderous roar, the water exploded around them. A father emerged from the darkness, a creature so massive and historically significant that it appeared to swallow the light surrounding it. Keeper of the Abyss.\nIts body evolved into a fusion of shadows and water, its eyes shining with an unearthly flame. The temperature fell, and the air itself appeared to ice in its presence. It hovered over them, a dark, relentless presence.\n\"You dare meddle with powers you cannot manipulate?\" The Keeper's voice rumbled, shaking the foundations of the temple.\nSophia stumbled back, her pulse irregular. \"We didn't mean to-\"\n\"You don't have any rights,\" the Keeper declared. \"to evoke what sleeps within the depths is to evoke the starvation.\"\nArin's words became marginally audible, and her body shook in effort to maintain the barrier. \"We most effective wanted to guard-\"\nThe Keeper raised his hand, and the shrine trembled. \"Safety comes at a cost. And now you may face the consequences of your inattention.\"\nWith a final flick of its palm, the Keeper's shape shifted, leaving an ominous trace etched into the shrine's walls. The image blazed with a strange blue light, and Sophia felt the unmistakable tug of reputation in her chest. She had seen it earlier, in her visions.\nThe Keeper's voice resonated as it disappeared into the shadows, \"The abyss is coming for you all.\"\nAs the shrine returned to silence, the strange picture continued to glow. Arin sank to her knees, her breath raspy with exertion. The water around them returned to normal, but the weight of what they had accomplished lingered heavily in the air.\nSophia came to be like Arin, her voice shaking. \"What became of that? \"What have we just done?\"\nArin raised her head, revealing her expression. \"We have bound the abyss-for the time being. \"But we've also opened the door.\"\nSophia looked back at the mark on the wall. The image transformed into a promise-and a warning. The abyss was no longer a threat; it was here, and it was coming for them.\nThe Crumbling Peace\nThe ocean has never appeared so vast and terrifying. As news of the Shark Clans' expanding fleet spread throughout the undersea kingdoms, a wave of paranoia surged through the realms. Nobody was spared-the once-allied nations now looked at one another with distrust, their shared records of peace becoming a distant memory in the face of impending war.\nThe palace was quiet as Tharros gathered the final council members, the weight of his responsibility pressing hard on his shoulders. His golden eyes surveyed the room, yet the faces before him were filled with doubt and tension. He should have felt it in the air-his ties had weakened, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't stop the tide from rising.\nSophia stood alongside him, hands clenched tightly in front of her. She sensed the shift, the alternate within the room. The delegates' anxious murmurs became louder, and their voices were laced with worry.\n\"They're getting stressed,\" Sophia remarked gently, looking at Tharros. \"They're thinking the entirety.\"\n\"I recognize.\" His voice was strained from frustration. \"I want them to see the truth.\" The Shark Clans remain a threat, but they are no longer our most formidable foe. The abyssal forces are transferring.\n\"however how do you persuade them?\" Sophia asked. \"All they're looking for is someone who is guilty. Aquaria has emerged as a scapegoat.\nKael, who was standing on the opposite side of the room, was watching the drama unfold with great interest. He had always been cautious of alliances, but now it appeared like every diplomatic relationship they had fought so hard to establish was disintegrating in front of them.\n\"There's a way to turn this around,\" Kael replied quietly. \"however it received't be smooth.\"\nBefore they could discuss it further, the entrance to the council chamber slid wide, and a delegate from the Deepwater Isles entered with a stern scowl. The audience went silent as he neared Tharros.\n\"Your Majesty,\" the emissary replied, bowing slightly. \"The Shark Clans have sent a new envoy. They declare that Aquaria is home to an abyssal creature.\nThe accusation hung in the air, like a lifeless weight. Sophia's heart skipped a beat. She examined Tharros, whose face was long past ashen.\n\"Harboring an abyssal entity?\" Tharros repeated, his voice calm but strained. \"that is absurd.\"\n\"I wish it were,\" the delegate replied. \"But they have spread the phrase throughout the kingdoms.\" There are already rumors that Aquaria isn't what it appears.\nThe room devolved into chaos as the various delegates began speaking over each other. The coalition was collapsing right before their eyes. The accusations, however false, had found fertile ground, and Tharros now faced the possibility of losing everything.\nKael moved forward, his voice becoming quieter amid the background cacophony. \"If the Shark Clans are spreading these lies, we must prove them wrong. We cannot allow them to turn the tide against us.\n\"I understand,\" Tharros said, his voice heavy with the weight of responsibility. \"however it's getting tougher to preserve the peace.\"\nThe subsequent diplomatic session was as annoying. Delegates from the surrounding underwater kingdoms had gathered in Aquaria, their expressions filled with distrust and concern. The air became dense with whispers, and each phrase felt as if it could shift the balance toward battle. Sophia and Kael waited behind the vast corridor, watching Tharros attempt to rally support from the other kingdoms.\n\"We need to unite,\" Tharros declared, his voice echoing throughout the room. \"The Shark Clans pose a threat, but so do the entities that lurk beneath the waves. \"If we don't stand together, we risk losing everything.\"\nBut his statements have been regarded with skepticism. A few delegates were already on the scene, satisfied that Aquaria was hiding evil powers. It was evident that no matter how Tharros tried to present his argument, the consideration had already passed.\n\"Do you think we're fooling ourselves?\" Sophia inquired Kael, her voice just above a whisper. \"We've lost their consider.\"\nKael looked at her, his expression opaque. \"Consider can be rebuilt. However, it would be most useful if we could prevent the Shark Clans from using this against us.\"\nA commotion broke out in the front of the room before Sophia had time to respond. A pale and shivering delegate ran towards Tharros with urgent tidings.\n\"A spy,\" the delegate exclaimed. \"We have discovered an undercover operative among us. Someone from the shark clans. They have been sabotaging the summit.\nThe room froze. Eyes flashed to one another, and the air became thick with suspicion. Tharros has now ordered a search of the property, but the harm has already been done. The whispers became louder, spurred by worry and distrust.\nSophia and Kael exchanged looks, both aware that they were now in the thick of something far more hazardous than political scheming.\nThe search for the spy did not take long. Moments thereafter, a mysterious parent was carried into the room, his hands chained behind his lower back. The guards forced him to his knees, and the room fell silent as all eyes drew closer to him.\nTharros advanced, his gaze focused. \"who're you?\"\nThe person's face grew pale, his eyes darting about the room in a desperate quest for an escape that would never come.\n\"I... I didn't mean to-\" The secret spy faltered, but his words were cut short by Tharros' stern instruction.\n\"Resolve the query,\" Tharros replied, his voice bloodless.\nThe secret spy gulped hard and looked up at him. \"I... I was sent through the Shark Clans. They... wanted to destroy the meeting, to show you all in antagonism to one another.\"\nThe revelation sent shockwaves through the room. The delegates mumbled, throwing dubious eyes at one another. The knowledge of the betrayal lingered heavily in the air.\nHowever, before anyone could respond, the undercover agent's body became rigid. His eyes bulged, and a guttural scream burst from his throat. His arms trembled, and within moments, the secret agent's body began to shudder uncontrollably, his face contorted in agony. The crowd gasped as the spy's last words reverberated out in a frantic rasp.\n\"The Leviathan... is already unsleeping,\" he blurted out, his voice filled with fear. \"Its starvation drives the Shark Clans... and it's going to wreck you all.\"\nWith a final severe convulsion, the spy's body crumpled to the ground, rendered worthless.\nSilence was observed. The weight of his words hung over the room like a black fog. The delegates were taken aback, and the situation became extremely tense. The simmering fear had exploded into full-blown terror.\n\"The leviathan?\" Kael mumbled under his breath, his eyes wide. \"If it's conscious...\"\nTharros' visage worsened, and his words became increasingly urgent. \"We want to act now. The Shark Clans are just the start.\"\nSophia hurried to him, her heart beating. \"However, what can we do? We've already misplaced the agreement.\"\nTharros locked eyes with her, his demeanor firm. \"We engage in combat. For Aquaria. \"For everything we've built.\"\nEchoes of the Abyss\nAs they plunged into the deep depths, the water around them became a dense, stifling blackness, with the weight of the ocean crushing down relentlessly. The slight hum of their system rang through the eerie calm, a reminder of how far they had strayed from Aquaria's shelter. The currents here felt unique, almost alive-an unpleasant sensation that caused the hairs on the back of Sophia's neck to push upward.\nTharros guided the way, his golden eyes surveying the black waters with practiced ease. Kael followed closely in the back, his eyes darting around, ever attentive. Sophia delivered up the rear, her heart thumping in her chest as she struggled to catch her breath. Something in the depths seemed to pull at her, something ancient and primordial. She should feel the weight of the leviathan's presence even now, in the hush that surrounded them.\n\"We're getting close,\" Tharros said, his voice low and almost lost in the immensity around them.\nThe tiny group was despatched to investigate the peculiar seismic events that had been reported in the region. Even though earthquakes are uncommon underwater, they have rattled the trenches in recent weeks, indicating that something far greater than any natural power is at action. Something had shaken the very foundation of the sea earth.\nSophia may wish to feel the slight tug of the abyss, which looked to get stronger the deeper they went. Her hydrokinesis buzzed beneath her pores and skin, and the water responded to her presence while also recoiling. It seemed as if the currents themselves were wary of them, pushing back in subtle and invisible ways.\n\"I don't like this,\" Kael mumbled, his voice tinged with the scenario. \"The deeper we pass, the stranger it feels.\"\nSophia nodded, her eyes darting frantically around them. \"I agree.\" It's as if the water is alive and responding to us.\nTharros returned her gaze with a gloomy expression. \"something is down right here, we need to locate it.\"\nThey paddled on in quiet, the darkness drawing nearer with each passing second. Finally, as they rounded a curve in the trench, they noticed a shape in the distance-something large, partially concealed by the whirling currents.\n\"It's a shape,\" Kael explained, pointing forward. \"some thing constructed.\"\nThe ruins rose from the seabed, ancient stone walls covered in layers of silt and barnacles. They were definitely man-made-or sea-made-in some type of forgotten shape from a long time ago. The walls were inscribed with symbols, strange, jagged runes that pulsed dimly within the dim light in their fits. Sophia could feel her heart increase as she swam closer. There was something about the symbols that she couldn't quite grasp.\n\"This doesn't make sense,\" Kael muttered, barely audible. \"I've by no means seen anything adore it.\"\nTharros began swimming toward the figure, his eyes examining the partitions. \"these markings... they're warnings.\"\nSophia approached, her gaze fixed on the etchings. As she studied the symbols, she felt an incredible sense of fear flood over her and constrict around her chest. There, engraved in stone, is an image of the leviathan: its massive, coiled body snaking through the depths, its dazzling eyes gazing into the abyss.\n\"I've seen this before,\" Sophia said, her hand quivering as she traced the engraving. \"In my visions.\"\nKael's gaze shifted to her. \"What does it mean?\"\nBefore Sophia could respond, the ground underneath them rocked. The water looked to churn, and the currents twisted wildly. The ruins' partitions groaned, as if the soil beneath them was going to give way.\n\"We want to leave,\" Tharros insisted, his voice stern. \"Now.\"\nHowever, it was too late.\nCreatures began to emerge from the ditch's darkness-abyssal beasts with twisted and hideous forms and eyes that sparkled with an eerie light. Their movements had been fluid, almost unearthly, as they moved around throughout the organization, preventing any escape.\n\"circulate!\" Tharros yelled, unsheathing his weapon as he charged at one of the beasts. Kael moved quickly, flashing his blade through the water and slashing at the nearest thing.\nSophia's pulse raced as she sought for her abilities, her arms quivering as she summoned the water to fight again. However, her manipulation faltered, and instead of a focused circulate, a burst of lightning emitted from her palms, sending a shockwave through the water. The power was strong enough to knock one of the creatures down again, but it grew uncontrollable, like a tidal wave slamming over the entire area.\n\"focus!\" Kael yelled, but it was drowned out by the tumult.\nThe beasts closed in on them, their growls resonating through the water as they advanced. Sophia felt a rush of panic rise through her chest. She couldn't control it-no longer the water, no longer her feelings, no matter what. The electricity inside her began to spin out of control.\nThen, as if drawn by the pandemonium, a giant figure appeared in the distance-something much larger and older than the monsters.\nThe leviathan.\nIts massive figure moved into the depths, its coiled frame reaching across the ditch like a serpent from the sea. Its bright eyes remained fixed on them, and the water around them seemed to throb with its presence, as if the ocean itself was responding to its awakening.\nSophia's powers rose again, more powerfully this time. She could feel the water rushing beside her, but it was no longer something she could control-it was something she was being pulled into, a reality too powerful to confront. The water sparkled around her, showing the leviathan's form inside the depths-a shadow of impossible proportions.\n\"No,\" she exclaimed, her breath coming in rapid, terrified gasps. \"It's right here.\"\nTharros and Kael fought the animals, their weapons sparkling in the dark water, but it was evident that the real war was coming from the depths. The leviathan awakened, and the ocean appeared to move in reaction.\n\"pass!\" Tharros cried again, his voice piercing, but Sophia remained transfixed, her gaze fixed on the leviathan. Its shape was like a nightmare: too large, too antique, to recognize. It became into a natural power, a predator that dominated the depths simply by being present.\nThe ground shook once more, but this time it wasn't because of the beasts attacking them. The ruins began to deteriorate, with the stones moving as if the structure itself was being ripped apart by the leviathan's awakening. The water surrounding them became a furious whirlwind, drawing them into the abyss.\n\"Get out!\" Kael's voice cut through the clamor, and he grabbed Sophia's arm, dragging her toward the exit.\nThey swam through the pandemonium, fighting the modern while the ruins collapsed around them. The creatures, now agitated, scattered as if the leviathan's presence was enough to send them scurrying. But it didn't remember-their true enemy transformed into the darkness, which eventually closed in on them.\nAs they approached the surface, the leviathan's growl boomed across the sea, vibrating in their bones. Sophia looked back, her heart beating in her chest. The leviathan's eyes blazed in the depths, and its massive form looked to curl, as if it had been following them and pushing them towards the abyss.\n\"We need to go,\" Tharros replied, his voice hoarse. \"Now.\"\nThey burst through the floor of the ocean, panting for oxygen, but the feeling of the leviathan's gaze stayed, its hunger ever present.\nSophia's fingers shook as she brushed saltwater off her cheeks. The mark on her arm, a dazzling image from the ruins, pulsed slightly, as if in response to the leviathan's name.\n\"We've reawakened something,\" she muttered.\nTharros' eyes met hers, his face harsh. \"And now, we need to face it.\"\nAbyssal Currents\nThe anxiety in Aquaria became apparent, a thick fog of worry and doubt that seemed to hang over the entire situation. Tharros had called another emergency meeting in the grand council chamber. The room grew full with delegates and advisors, all eyes fixed on him as he stood in the front, his golden eyes flashing with intensity. He could feel their expectations weighing down on him. Time started running out.\n\"everybody, concentrate!\" Tharros' words rang out, causing quiet. \"The leviathan awakens. We can no longer afford to argue among ourselves. We must act now.\"\nHowever, while his words rang with authority, a murmur of disagreement echoed around the audience. Some councilors exchanged suspicious looks.\n\"How will we even understand what we're facing?\" Each of them, a councilor from the Northern Trench, demanded something. \"You expect us to risk everything based only on what? A few visions and some ruins? We need more than that to justify opening our borders for battle.\"\nSophia stood in the back of the room, her gaze fixated on Tharros. Her heart pounded in her chest, and the sights she'd had remained fresh in her thoughts. She may want to feel the weight of their gaze on her, the whispers of doubt and fear that hovered in the air like a typhoon cloud.\n\"The Leviathan is not just a fable,\" she continued, her voice steady but loaded with intense passion from her lower back. \"It is actual. I've seen it. The abyssal forces are rising, and if we don't stop them soon, it will be too late.\nKael's standing, which came after her, moved uneasily. His jaw tightened, and his gaze grew faraway. Sophia noted the strain in his posture, the way he stood just aside from the others. He was not a member of the council, but his role in the upcoming fight became clear.\nA councilor from the eastern Plains, with sharp features and a gravelly voice, scoffed. \"What do you want us to do, then? Kneel before your 'visions'? We've fought battles and shed blood for our country, and now you want us to believe that the ocean itself has turned against us?\nThe room appeared to shut in on her, the weight of their mistrust almost crushing. Sophia's breath stuck in her throat, but before she could answer, Arin spoke out, her voice breaking through the tension.\n\"Enough,\" she murmured, her eyes filled with a strong determination. \"This is not necessarily the time for petty disagreements. We all recognize that the Shark Clans are a good place to start. The leviathan moves beneath us. It is more than just a vision of our doom; it is a natural force that cannot be ignored.\"\nTharros offered Arin a brief nod of thanks, but the tension in the room had not subsided. Sophia's gaze shifted to Kael as the council continued to deliberate. He shifted his gaze to the floor, his arms gripped tightly in front of him, and for a brief second, she noticed something-a flash of shame, buried deep under the surface.\n\"What's taking place?\" Sophia asked quietly, going towards him.\nWhen Kael gazed up at her, his blue eyes darkened. \"I'm not sure I'm the character everyone thinks I am,\" he said, his voice low and almost too quiet to hear. \"I have spent my entire life hiding my past. However, while we really want solidarity, I'm wondering if I'm the one pushing us apart.\"\nSophia frowned. \"Kael, you have been nothing but dependable to Aquaria.\" You battled for us and for me. Whatever your background is, it does not change what you have accomplished.\"\nHe caught her gaze with a troubled expression. \"What if the beyond is what will break us apart? My bloodline is a curse, Sophia. The shark clans are aware of this. The other kingdoms understand it. and i-\"\nShe placed a hand on his arm and silenced him. \"You're not on your own in this, Kael. \"We are all in this together.\"\nArin, in the meantime, began scouring one of the historical texts she had discovered days before. The e-book became worn, the pages yellowed with age, but the secrets it contained were valuable. She had worked tirelessly to decipher the text, looking for any clue that could help them bind the leviathan before it fully awakened.\nHours passed as the debate in the council chamber raged on, but Arin's focus remained unwavering. She had found something-a passage hidden deep within the text. She'd read it over and over, her heart racing with each phrase.\n\"It's here,\" she whispered to herself, her voice barely audible.\nThe ritual was described in cryptic terms, but it was clear: if they were to stand a chance against the leviathan, they needed to unite their powers. All four of them: the warriors, the sorceress, and the chosen one. Their abilities could combine to create a force strong enough to bind the leviathan's power.\nHowever, the text became clear about the fee. This ritual would no longer be performed without a sacrifice.\nArin knew what she had to do.",

        "content": "The council session eventually got here to a near, nevertheless not whatsoever had been resolved. the talk had most effective increased the gaps inside Aquaria, and the fracture lines of their alliances have been growing larger. The council had achieved little development, and with every passing hour, the urgency of the state of affairs have been bigger clear.\nSophia become exhausted, her thoughts reeling from the arguments and the developing feel of isolation. no one seems to agree with in what she had seen, what all of them had felt. The strength of the leviathan was actual, but the country got divided, and it converted into pulling them apart.\nAs she left the council chamber, she saw herself by myself inside the corridor, her footsteps ringing within the stillness. the weight of the circumstance landed on her shoulders, and she or he closed her eyes, willing herself to live strong.\nhowever when she opened them, she was not on my own.\nA parent stood on the end of the corridor, its presence almost like a shadow. She tensed, ready to shield herself, but the parent advanced, revealing an acquainted face.\nIt turned into Tharros.\n\"What are you doing here?\" Sophia requested, amazed.\nTharros' countenance was somber, his eyes expressing the gravity of the situation. \"I couldn't stand watching the kingdom tear itself apart. We want to act, Sophia. \"If we don't, Aquaria will be lost.\"\nShe took a stride in his direction. \"However, the council is divided. How can we resist something as powerful as the Leviathan if we refuse to recognize one other's truth?\"\nTharros took a long breath, laying his palm on the hilt of his sword. \"We don't have the luxury of deliberating. We have to act. We have no different desire.\"\nSophia nodded, her determination strengthened. \"Then we'll combat. For Aquaria. \"For everything we've built.\"\nAs the days passed, the preparations continued, but the gaps in their alliance grew deeper. Tharros worked frantically to get what assistance he could, but the country was divided. persons who had once stood by using his aspect had been now questioning his each flow, divided between loyalty and worry.\nThe very last strike occurred as a messenger arrived with a letter from the Shark Clans.\n\"Open warfare,\" the messenger said sadly, passing the message to Tharros. \"they may now not stop till they have got the whole of Aquaria below their control.\"\nThe room grew hushed, the reality of the situation sinking like a stone into their hearts.\nSophia became Tharros, her voice low. \"They recognize we're vulnerable. They believe they are able to weigh us down.\"\nTharros nodded, his mouth fixed in a stern expression. \"And they're correct.\" But we can no longer cross silently.\nAfter the Shark Clans declared war, there was no turning back. Aquaria was on the verge of disaster, and all they could do was brace themselves for the approaching cyclone.\nThe Depths Awaken\nThe waters around Aquaria had darkened in recent days, bringing with them unexpected phenomena. The aquatic critters, which had formerly thrived in the vivid coral reefs, had begun to disappear, displaced by forces unknown. The previously prosperous underwater forests had wilted, their colors fading to pale grays. And as the days passed, the ocean itself seemed to weep, its waters churning with an unnatural restlessness, alive with an energy that no one could explain.\nSophia stood on the edge of the palace's topmost balcony, her eyes riveted on the sea in the distance. The horizon grew covered with an unpleasant blackness that appeared to grow every day. The sky had appeared as an unending shade of deep blue, casting an eerie light over the waves.\n\"I've never seen the sea like this,\" she added, her tone heavy with subject.\nTharros joined her at the balcony, his face gloomy. \"The sea seems to be asking for something. \"Something... ancient.\"\nThe council had reconvened behind them, the sense of urgency building with each passing hour. The last few days have been filled with news of useless coral reefs, altered sea creatures, and an overwhelming sense of uneasiness. Anyone felt it, but no one knew what it meant. The abyss grew closer, its impact spreading like a disease through the waves.\nSophia turned to face Tharros. \"What must we do?\" Confront it now, or wait until it's completely awake?\"\nTharros paused, his jaw hardening. \"We don't have much time. If we wait too long, we risk losing the entire thing to its force.\"\nKael stepped forward, his face hardened with purpose. \"We do not have the luxury of waiting. We want to find the source and halt it before it's too late.\"\nSophia's heart fluttered at the prospect of delving more into the thriller of the Leviathan's reappearance. She had seen the signals in her visions and felt their presence as an oppressive weight. But there was still a lot they didn't recognize. Should they stop it? And if they did, what was the fee?\n\"We'll look into the reefs first,\" Tharros told his voice companions. \"find the supply of this disturbance.\"\nBy the time Sophia and Kael arrived to the reef's edge, the sun had already set and the aquatic world had faded into darkness. Their movements had been quick and stealthy, with the currents drawing them deeper into the sea as the black shapes of coral and rock loomed around them.\nThe reef became abnormally silent. The brilliant colors that had formerly decorated the underwater world were now irrelevant, with the coral reduced to skeletal structures covered with a thick covering of dark algae. The water was chilly, and the pressure from the depths began to bear on them.\n\"Do you sense that?\" Kael inquired, his voice low as he surveyed the area.\nSophia nodded, leaning her palm against a nearby rock for stability. \"Something is off. \"The water feels alive, but not in an amazing way.\"\nKael held his blade more tightly, his instincts on high alert. \"live close.\"\nThey pushed onward, their gaze flickering back and forth as they traversed the eerie, calm waters. The species that had once lived on the reef were nowhere to be seen, and the longer they swam, the more stifling the quiet became. It seemed as if the entire reef had been abandoned: deserted and empty.\nThe water suddenly rippled fiercely, and animals emerged from the shadows-dark, twisted variants of the sea life that had once called the reef its home. Their bodies were swollen and deformed, and their eyes were sickly mild. They growled as they moved towards them, their gestures wild and inhuman.\n\"Get prepared!\" Kael exclaimed, drawing his sword.\nSophia held her arms out, calling the water to her, but as she did, she felt it-a burst of electricity that shot through her body, more intense than anything she'd ever felt before. The water responded, but it was wild, almost as if it had its own mind. She flung her hands forward, shooting a wave of energy toward the nearest thing, but the water merely fueled the creature's rage, its darkish figure striking out at her with inhuman speed.\n\"backpedal!\" Kael shouted as he chopped through one of the beasts, knocking it into the lake. The others did not retreat, instead advancing with even greater violence.\nSophia's heart raced as she tried to keep her consciousness, her abilities soaring out of control. The water around them writhed like a living thing, reacting to her anxiety and rage. She should listen to the monsters' piercing breaths and growls reverberating across the lake.\n\"assist!\" Sophia yelled out, but her voice was smothered by the thundering waves. The creatures have been unrelenting, bringing them closer to the reef's threshold.\nWhen the creatures closed up on them, a loud crack rang through the water. A enormous shadow loomed above them, and a beam of light broke through the water, lighting the scene in an ethereal radiance.\nSophia gasped. There, partially buried in the sand under them, transformed into an artifact-a massive, finely carved stone glowing with an alien charge. The water appeared to bend around it, as if intrigued by its strength. It was historical, older than anything Sophia had ever seen.\nSophia instinctively stretched out and touched the relic. The minute her fingers made touch with the stone, a strong burst of energy erupted, sending a tremor across the water. The animals recoiled, twitching their bodies as if struck by an unseen force.\nSophia felt her chest tighten and her breath stop in her throat as the strength of the item rushed through her. She should be able to see-or sense-it deep within her spirit. A black, coiled figure emerges from the depths, slithering through the water like a serpent. It became the leviathan. It was a wakeup call.\n\"No,\" she exclaimed, her vision blurred with the intensity of the connection. \"It is conscious. \"The leviathan is fully awake.\"\nKael clutched her arm, his eyes wide with alarm. \"We need to get out of here, now!\"\nHowever, before they could react, the floor under them rocked, and a terrible howl echoed through the water. The sea itself appeared to quake in reaction, with the currents twisting and buckling beneath the leviathan's awakening.",

        "content": "\"We must leave!\" Kael yelled, pushing her back in the direction of the surface.\nThe item in Sophia's hand pulsed one last time, releasing a wave of energy that rippled through the water, producing a shockwave that threw them all off balance. The water surged violently around them, the pressure almost crushing. The sea became combative again. The leviathan's energy grew, and it spread across the depths like a poison.\nAs they swam upstream, the reef's remnants began to collapse around them. The coral walls split and crumbled, sinking into the abyss. The black creatures, their eyes flashing with wrath, withdrew into the depths, disappearing into the shadows.\nSophia and Kael broke through the surface, gasping for oxygen, their bodies heavy with exertion. The leviathan's growls echoed across the water, rattling the ocean's foundations.\n\"It's coming,\" Sophia said, her voice shaking. \"It's already right here.\"\nKael did not respond. He did not want to. The look in his eyes told everything. They had stirred up something far worse than they had anticipated. And now they had to face the consequences.\nThe leviathan was awake, and nothing would ever be the same again.\nBreaking the Tide\nAquaria became under siege.\nThe earthquakes that shook the city's foundations were caused by more than just the Leviathan's distant growls. They were from the Shark Clans, and they were launching a full-scale assault. The major wave had emerged from the ocean's depths, like legendary monsters. They had been attacking from all angles, using their fast, synchronized motions to test the palace's defenses. The waters appeared to quiver upon their approach.\nSophia stood in the center of the castle, her breath short and shallow as she looked about the great room. The surroundings became thick with urgency. The council had a long-term goal that devolved into chaos, with contributors scrambling to safeguard their own territories, leaving Tharros to organize the city's defense.\nTharros moved across the room, his gaze focused and calculating. \"We don't have much time. The defenses will not last long in the face of a prolonged onslaught. \"We need to push them again.\"\nSophia nodded as her thoughts raced. The last preparations for the binding ceremony were almost complete, but they were no match for the carnage unleashed by the Shark Clans. Every second counted now. Each choice should mean the difference between life and death for Aquaria.\n\"I'll help with the ritual,\" Sophia said with determination in her voice. \"However, we need Kael and Arin with us. The power required to bind the Leviathan is too great for one person.\"\nTharros looked at her, his eyes narrowing. \"I will not spare anyone. They're already overburdened protecting the road.\"\nSophia returned his gaze, her expression hardening. \"If we don't stop the ritual, the barrier will come down. We do not have enough money to attend.\"\nTharros gritted his teeth but did not argue. \"quality. However, you are all being targeted. This is our final hazard.\"\nKael and Arin were already getting ready the ritual website when Sophia and Tharros arrived. The chamber beneath the palace have been picked for its proximity to the ancient energy sources that would conduct the magic. but while they collected throughout the ritual circle, the barriers trembled with the power of the attack out of doors. The sound of clashing metal and the cries of conflict resonated trough the palace halls.\n\"you may experience it, can't you?\" Arin remarked, her voice low as she grew to move closer to them. \"The strength. It's building-rising with the conflict.\"\nSophia nodded. \"The leviathan is feeding at the struggle. we've need to finish the rite now.\"\nTharros inspected the establishment, his face a masque of resolve. \"let's get it executed.\"\nWhile the 4 of them accumulated across the ritual circle, Kael's eyes lingered on Sophia, his demeanor challenging but laden with unsaid emotion. He became equipped, yet the weight of their duty appeared to dangle heavy on him.\n\"We're doing this collectively,\" Kael, his voice company, stated.\nSophia nodded sharply, her heart clenching. She could feel the weight of the assignment in advance. The ritual could demand everything from them. They would need to unify their powers in ways they hadn't done before. And in that union, they would either destroy the leviathan's grip on the earth... or unleash it completely.\nHowever, before they could begin, a yell sounded from the passageway.\n\"Tharros!\" A messenger rushed into the chamber, his face blanched with fear. \"The Shark Clans have broken through the outer walls. We will not maintain them!\"\nTharros' jaws constricted. \"We're out of time.\"\nWithout saying anything further, he turned and hurried towards the palace's gates. The others observed, briefly leaving the ritual web site in the background. The struggle for Aquaria was already in progress, and every breath they drew seemed to mirror the intensity of the situation.\nOutside, the war raged. The Shark Clans, unrelenting and brutal, had already begun their onslaught on Aquaria's heart. The palace's fortifications were under attack, and the sound of steel hitting scales echoed across the lake. Tharros led the charge, his blade shining in the low light, slicing through the enemies with accuracy. Kael, Arin, and Sophia watched, their weapons drawn, obstructing their path through the enemy trails.\nKael became in his element, his blade cutting through the water with lethal precision. Sophia's hydrokinesis flowed about her, using the currents to deflect and assault in one continuous motion. Arin, using her extensive knowledge of magic, constructed barriers of natural electricity to protect them from the continuous onslaught.\nEven with their combined strength, the Shark Clans had been overwhelming. They fought with a depth born of desperation, from the starving that would inevitably result from the leviathan's rising. The assault was no longer just a struggle; it had evolved into a coordinated strike, a ritual in its own right, satisfying the leviathan's thirst.\nAs they fought their way through the turmoil, Kael came face to face with the Shark Clans' chief, an imposing figure with deep red eyes and a large trident. Their swords clashed, and Kael's breath came in short bursts as he focused fully on the fight.\n\"you believe you studied you could forestall us?\" The commander snarled, his voice echoing throughout the pool. \"The Leviathan is already conscious. It is far from a matter of desire. We are its heralds. \"The waters may be remade.\nKael's coronary heart dropped. He realized the leader's words had been appropriate. The leviathan's energy was growing stronger by the second. However, he couldn't let them win.\n\"You're no longer the only ones who can manage the ocean,\" Kael hissed, rushing forward. The conflict was far from over, and their lives-and Aquaria's destiny-depended on the stability.\nLower back at the ritual location, the four of them had gathered, each concentrated on their respective component of the spell. Arin stood in the center, her arms uplifted, chanting the old incantations. The air surrounding them pulsed with strength, yet something seemed odd. The energy didn't flow as it should. Sophia should be stressed because her powers are no longer acting as expected.\n\"We want to attention!\" Arin shouted, her voice straining with effort. \"the connection has to be perfect!\"\nSophia nodded, but her thoughts raced. The enemy was at their doorstep. The leviathan's electricity evolved into a feeding frenzy, and they needed to act quickly.\nAs they finished the final incantation, the ground underneath them rocked and the chamber's dividers began to crumble. The water around them churned wildly, as if the ocean itself had rejected the rite.\n\"This isn't just the Shark Clans,\" Tharros whispered quietly, a palpable fear creeping in his chest. \"The leviathan's have an impact on is pushing lower back.\"\nArin's eyes expanded. \"It is battling us! It did not allow us to regulate it.\nThe air became heavy with anxiety as the final words of the ritual were spoken, but just as the barrier began to solidify, the Shark Clans played their trump card. Abyssal magic inundated the palace, undermining its defenses. The barrier flickered and then cracked, sending shockwaves into the ocean.\n\"No!\" Arin wailed, her palms reaching out urgently to keep the spell. However, the magic faded away, being drawn into the abyssal depths.\n\"We ought to hold them off!\" Tharros shouted. \"The barrier will fall. \"We need to finish this now!\"\nOutside, the battle raged on, but the voices of the fallen were drowned out by the leviathan's growls, which echoed through the deep depths. As the barrier eventually collapsed, the ocean around Aquaria trembled. The presence of the leviathan no longer posed a threat; it was now right here.\nThe city held its breath as the final Shark Clans were pushed back, but as the sounds of conflict faded, a new sound filled the air-low, guttural, and far more horrifying than anything before. The leviathan's voice echoed through the currents, threatening destruction.\nAquaria had survived the attack, but the real war had only begun.\nThe Leviathan Stirs\nThe ocean trembled. It was slight at first, a vibration that shook the very basis of Aquaria, but it has swiftly become clear. The town trembled as if the ocean itself had awakened, stretching and groaning as it emerged from the depths. The air became dense with salt and fear. No one knew how much longer the town's partitions could withstand the leviathan's energies.\nSophia stood on the balcony, her palms holding the railing and staring out into the horizon. The ocean, which was once serene and pure, has darkened and rippled with artificial waves. The air became heavy with anxiety, as if the planet was holding its breath.\n\"Be prepared,\" Tharros murmured behind her, his voice low and full of grim determination. He stood upright, looking every bit the chief he had become, yet even his stern demeanor couldn't conceal the weight of the situation. \"It's going on.\"\nSophia nodded, but her heart raced in her chest. She had known this second becoming was coming and felt it in her bones for days. The leviathan grew, and everything Aquaria had built ended up on the road.\nA enormous figure emerged from the depths, so large and incomprehensible that the ocean appeared to fold under its weight. The leviathan's appearance like a nightmare come to life, with its coiled frame rippling through the water and casting a shadow over the entire city. Its eyes gleamed with an ancient flame, a dark, malicious power that seemed to reach the very soul of the water.\n\"We don't have time,\" Kael said, his voice consistent but full of desperation. \"The city's fortifications won't last much longer. \"We want to finish what we started.\"\nSophia turned to him, her expression fading. She had felt the draw of the Leviathan before, but this time it was more particular. This time, however, its strength became all-consuming, drowning everything in its wake. The leviathan got fully awake, and its hunger became insatiable.\nTharros improved, his eyes narrowing as he took in the massive beast emerging from the depths. \"We'll want every best friend we can get.\" The prophecy is no longer a fiction; it is a caution. Either we stop this now or we lose everything.\"\nThe streets of Aquaria were already in pandemonium. The echoes of the leviathan's growl resonated throughout the town, causing panic among the residents. The palace walls shook, and beyond, the ocean surged in reaction to the leviathan's awakening.\n\"Absolutely everyone is afraid,\" Sophia replied, her voice shaking. \"What if the prophecy is wrong?\" \"What if we can't prevent it?\"\nKael's hand lingered on her shoulder, his eyes soft but steady. \"We will stop it. collectively.\"\nInside the council room, Aquaria's leaders were disorganized. Some advocated for rapid evacuation, while others persisted on preparing for battle. The tension was rising as allies debated whether the prophecy that had brought them together would be their salvation-or their demise. They were divided, unsure whether their most powerful wish had transformed into the ritual they'd all begun, or if they were on their way to certain death.\nArin paced, her expression stern, as she read through the historical passages again. \"There's a manner,\" she said to herself. \"There's usually a manner.\"\n\"What manner?\" Tharros inquired, his voice filled with impatience. He became truly suffering in order to keep the council together, while his awareness dwindled among them and anarchy erupted outside.\n\"The ritual,\" Arin explained. \"It can tie the Leviathan, but it requires anyone. Our powers are united. It no longer effectively prevents the leviathan. It is roughly controlling it. The most useful question is if we're powerful enough.\"\nSophia advanced. \"The attachment I felt... is more than just fear. The leviathan seems to want me there, as if it is reaching out to me. If I can manage it, maybe I can use that connection to stop it.\"\nKael shakes his head. \"Sophia, you could't-\"\n\"I have to,\" she interrupted, her voice full of conviction. \"It's my simplest desire.\"\n\"Wait,\" Arin said, her gaze piercing as she appeared among them. \"There is a trap. Sophia, the ritual demands more than your power. It takes from you. It bonds you to the Leviathan for all time.\"\nSophia's heartbeat skipped. \"What does that imply?\"\nArin hesitated, her expression solemn. \"It means that in order to avoid it, you must provide a portion of yourself. \"Something you can never get back.\"\nSophia's thoughts raced. The weight of the decision slammed against her chest. The leviathan's electricity grew, feeding off the worry, turmoil, and damage it caused. Should she sacrifice herself to shop Aquaria? Or would it be an enormous quantity, too unsafe to attempt?\n\"I'll do it,\" Sophia said, her voice steady even as her insides twisted with uncertainty. \"I'm prepared.\"\nKael's hand met hers, his grip strong. \"I can't lose you,\" he said quietly, but without hesitation. \"We'll do that together.\"\nThe floor trembled as the leviathan's roar shattered the air and echoed over Aquaria's streets. The city was awash in terror. The waters across the palace had risen, pounding into the barriers, and the ocean outside no longer provided a calming pressure. It evolved into a beast, a dwelling pressure of nature that tried to eat everything in its path.\n\"We don't have much time,\" Tharros stated, his voice full of desperation. \"It's now or in no way.\"\nSophia, Kael, Arin, and Tharros navigated to the ritual webpage online, deep within the palace. As they entered the chamber, the air was thick with electricity, and the walls were alive with the power of the magic they were about to perform.\nKael and Arin took their positions, side by side with Tharros. Sophia walked into the middle, her heart thumping. The water inside the room began to move, swirling around her as her link to the leviathan grew. The ocean seemed to respond to her, with a diffused current of energy pouring through the waves.\nAs they began the incantation, the waves outside grew louder. The lightning of the leviathan's presence shocked Aquaria to its core. Sophia should have felt it within herself, a profound, bone-chilling starvation that turned her stomach.\nBut she held solid, concentrating on the energy she needed to harness. The ritual evolved into operation-slowly and brutally, but it was working. Her link to the leviathan became clear, and she should be able to feel its raw energy rushing through her veins. The others were focused, their energies mixing, but Sophia's might became the driving force, drawing them toward the binding they needed to form.\nBut even as the ceremony began to take effect, the leviathan's growl echoed again. This time, it became unique-deeper, more primal. It was no longer merely a sound. It transformed into a force, a wave of energy that swept over them like a tidal wave.\nSophia gasped as the leviathan's might overwhelmed her senses. She felt it clawing at her, reaching into her soul and threatening to devour her. The arena around her blurred as the binding began to form, but it became increasingly harder to hang on. The ceremony eventually took its toll.\n\"maintain on, Sophia!\" Kael shouted, his voice distant, as the room twisted around her.\nThe water inside the chamber rose, and Sophia cried out as the leviathan's roar grew louder. The sea was alive with rage, and he or she should have felt it pulling at her, pushing her deeper into its depths.\nHowever, she refused to break. She could not. The city depended on her.\nWith one more rush of strength, the binding was completed. The water surrounding them exploded in a blast of light. The leviathan's roar faded as it disappeared into the depths. However, as the light faded, the environment around them appeared to tremble in response to the Leviathan's remaining influence.\nSophia sank to her knees, her breathing ragged, but the town had been saved-for now.\nHowever, as she looked up, she should pay attention to it, which was dim but distinct. The Leviathan's voice continued to ring across the currents, proclaiming that the conflict was only just getting started.\nSophia’s Leadership\nAquaria had survived the preliminary wave. The leviathan was forced back, at least for the time being, but the city was far from healed. The streets were littered with rubbish, and the previously clean coral barriers were now scarred by the scars of war. The air became thick with the leftovers of fear and the looming presence of the abyss, yet for the first time in days, the sun broke through the clouds, sending a dim light over town.\nSophia stood on the royal balcony, watching as the town slowly recovered. Her heart was heavy with the weight of everything that had happened, everything she had seen, but there was a sense of calm now, a deep tranquility that allowed her to breathe.\nHowever, that peace became unstable.\nThe once-divided council had begun to unite under Tharros' leadership, but Sophia may want to witness the shifting tides. They were now attempting to see her as more than just a symbol of desire, but as someone capable of making decisions and leading them into an uncertain future.\nBut what does it mean to steer? She wondered, her head clouded with uncertainty. She has always been one to follow and learn from others, but now, in the aftermath of the Leviathan's waking, the sector is turning to her to lead them forward.\n\"Sophia,\" Tharros said, interrupting her thoughts. He stood behind her, his voice lower than usual, and his presence grounding. \"We want you inside. \"The council is ready.\"\nSophia grew to become to him, her eyes fatigued yet determined. \"I understand. Let's move.\"\nWithin the palace, the council had already assembled. The anxiety was evident as each delegate took their place, focusing on Sophia. Tharros was at the head of the table, but it became clear that he could not lead this assembly on his own. Sophia's presence was essential today, not as a mere figurehead, but as a decision-maker.\n\"Thanks for joining us,\" Tharros said, his voice regular but with a hushed eagerness. \"The main priority is to maintain the dominion. We've made some progress, but there are still concerns about the Shark Clans' next move.\"\nSophia sat down, the room's focus fixed on her. Her arms lightly beat against the desk, a nervous dependence she had not fully shook. \"We do not have the money to continue expecting the Shark Clans to comply. We need a proactive strategy.\nArin, sitting next her, leaned forward. \"Agreed. However, we must also consider the long-term consequences. The leviathan isn't long gone. It is still there, deep within, and its influence has only just begun.\"\nSophia gazed at Arin, feeling the weight of her words. They had managed to confine the leviathan for the time being, but its lightning remained a constant threat, casting a huge shadow over everything. She should still feel its presence, hiding just beneath the floor of her thoughts. Every vibration in the water told her that it had not really been that long.\n\"We want to form alliances,\" Sophia said, her voice calm, her confidence growing with each syllable. \"The Shark Clans can be a problem, but they may just be one part of the solution. If we want to rebuild, we need the guide from each kingdom. We seek unity, not only in defense, but also in reason.\"",

        "content": "The room grew hushed as the council considered her words. Sophia may have noticed the eyes in the room shifting between her and Tharros as the tension increased. She could see they were paying close attention to her right now. They had always respected her, but now they were looking for something more-something she hadn't noticed within herself.\n\"International relations are essential,\" Sophia continued. \"However, we must recognize that the effects of the Leviathans extend beyond physical strain. It has touched the hearts of everyone around us-both allies and foes. We want to understand the mystery behind it, the mysterious forces at play.\"\nTharros nodded, his eyes fixed on her. \"We will not do this by ourselves, Sophia. We want you. no longer just as a frontrunner, but as someone who understands the alchemy that connects the water and the leviathan. Your connection with it... It's what will guide us.\"\nSophia's stomach constricted. She had been avoiding thinking about the magic, about her new relationship with the leviathan. It becomes toxic, ingestible, and increasingly potent with each passing day. She considered using it to guard Aquaria. But what if that electricity arrived at an unsustainable price?\n\"I understand what you're asking,\" Sophia said, her voice trailing off somewhat. \"But I won't be able to manage it. It is an excessive amount of. The strength, the connection-it is astounding.\"\n\"You did it earlier,\" Tharros replied carelessly. \"You've accomplished things that others couldn't. Sophia, your link to the Leviathan is the key. \"We have all seen it.\"\nShe peered across the table, gathering the gazes of each council member. There was a quiet, silent acceptance of the truth in their eyes, but it also grew filled with expectation. They wanted her to take the reins and guide them through the pandemonium.\nHowever, how could she lead them if she felt out of control?\nThe discussion went on, each selection weighing heavy in the air. Sophia's thoughts raced as they discussed potential alliances, commerce routes, and naval techniques. Throughout it all, the fundamental issue-the Leviathan's effect-loomed over everything. Each decision they took appeared to push them closer to a tipping point, and no one was sure which way the scales would fall.\nSophia felt exhausted when the council finally disbanded, as if the electricity had been sapped from her. She needed to leave, ponder, and breathe.\nTharros stuck to her as she exited the council chamber. \"Sophia, wait.\"\nShe paused, her heart racing in her chest. \"I'm not sure I'm the ideal person for this. \"I can't bear the weight of it all.\"\nTharros moved closer, his stare steady and unrelenting. \"You are the only one who can do that. We all feel the weight, but you've demonstrated time and again that you have the strength to carry it.\"\nSophia shook her head, tears threatening to fall. \"But I'm not only bearing the weight of Aquaria anymore. I, too, am carrying the leviathan's burden. It's my inner self, Tharros. I'm not sure how much longer I'll keep it at bay.\"\nHe placed his hand on her shoulder, grounding her. \"Then let us help you. You don't need to convey it on my behalf. \"We are always with you.\"\nFor a minute, they stood silent, the weight of his words sinking in. Sophia was unaware of the fate that lay ahead. She wasn't sure if she could keep Aquaria secure, or if the leviathan would eventually eat everything she adored. However, for the first time in a long time, she allowed herself to believe in something other than fear.\nLater that evening, Sophia stood at the edge of the palace, watching the first stars appear in the sky. The sea spread out before her, calm yet gloomy. The leviathan remained beneath the seas, as did Aquaria, who maintained her status and continued to fight.\nShe had no solutions, no clear path forward. However, for the first time, she felt a stirring deep inside her-an electricity that came from grappling with the abyss, both in terms of status and darkness.\nAnd with that, she knew she had moved into gear. She was prepared to deal with whatever happened next. Now, not just for Aquaria, but also for herself.\nAs she began to go back inside, she heard it-smooth at first, a faint rumble in the distance. The leviathan growls. It was a promise.\nThe storm was not over. However, they were prepared to face it head-on.\nUnveiled Edges\nKael's boots boomed across the dim hall, his feet crisp against the polished coral floorboards. He ran backward and forward, his heart racing as ideas collided in his mind. A warrior by blood and subject, he rarely allowed emotions to overrule his common sense, but tonight he became exclusive.\nTharros had been silent about Sophia for too long, and Kael couldn't ignore the rising tension between them. This wasn't just about the Leviathan or Aquaria; it was about her. \nThe door creaked open behind him. Kael paused, turning swiftly to watch Tharros enter the hallway. The Dragon King's visage became as serene as ever, but his eyes revealed the storm boiling within.\n\"Kael,\" Tharros said, his deep voice carrying the weight of centuries. \"We need to talk.\"\nKael squared his shoulders, his azure green gaze fixed on Tharros. \"speak? Or are you here to explain your use of her as a weapon rather than a person?\nTharros' brows furrowed together, and his lips tightened into a narrow line. \"Think about your tone, warrior. You forget who you're addressing.\"\n\"I know exactly who I'm speaking to,\" Kael said again, getting closer. \"And maybe that's the problem. You believe that if you studied, you could command everyone, including her.\nTharros' jaw tightened, and his implementing discern exuded authority. \"You suppose you study and understand her better than I do? You've been thinking about her for months, Kael. I've felt her connectedness to the world long before you even\"\n\"This isn't approximately who met her first!\" Kael interrupted, his voice rising. \"It's similar to how she feels now. And just now, she is being thrashed below your expectations.\"\nThe air around them became heavy, crackling with unspoken anxiety. They had been titans poised on the edge of a battlefield, neither prepared to back down.\nBefore Tharros could respond, a silky voice broke through the charged silence.\n\"sufficient.\"\nBoth men turned to face Sophia, her figure framed by the soft glow of bioluminescent coral. She wore a modest robe, her hair cascading about her shoulders, but it was her gaze that stopped them cold-stern, determined, and unyielding.\n\"This ends now,\" she murmured, taking a step forward. \"i'm not a prize to be fought over.\"\nKael opened his mouth, but Sophia lifted her hand to hush him. \"No, concentrate on me. Both of you. If this link between us comes to mean something, it was first valued. For me. For every other. \"Do you understand?\"\nTharros sighed slowly, his expression softening. \"Sophia, we simplest need to defend you.\"\n\"And you watched this facilitates?\" She inquired, her voice harsh but not rude. \"I can't command Aquaria or face the Leviathan if you're constantly fighting. \"We're stronger together, but only if we act like it.\"\nKael looked aside, remorse flaring in his eyes. \"You're correct. I let my delight get in the way.\"\nTharros nodded, hesitantly. \"As did I.\"\nSophia moved between them and placed a hand on each of their shoulders. \"Let this be the end of it.\" \"We have bigger battles to fight.\"\nThat evening, the council room grew strangely silent, with the usual hum of pastime replaced by a palpable sense of apprehension. Sophia sat at the top of the table, flanked by Tharros and Kael. The council members, a mix of merfolk, sea witches, and various Aquarian leaders, observed her with interest and anticipation.\nSophia took a long breath to stabilize herself. \"We've been behind schedule with this conversation long enough. The Leviathan remains a threat, although it is no longer the most effective one. \"We need to prepare for what's coming.\"\nArin, sitting across the table, leaned forward. \"So, what exactly is coming? \"The Leviathan has not moved in days.\"\nSophia responded, \"That's what concerns me.\" \"It is too quiet. I've been sensing something. A draw from deep within the water. It's difficult to explain, but it's more than just the Leviathan. \"There is something else.\"\nMurmurs spread around the room. Tharros cleared his throat, catching their attention. \"Sophia's instincts have shown to be reliable before. If she detects a totally new threat, we must take it seriously.\"\nOne of the elder council members, a grizzled and well-known mer, grimaced. \"So, what do you recommend we do? Mobilize our forces? Is there any likelihood of scaring the Leviathan further?\"\nSophia returned his look, her demeanor friendly. \"No. We want statistics first. If something is available, we want to recognize it before taking action. That is why I am proposing an excursion to the Abyssal Trench.\nThe room erupted with protests and whispers. The Abyssal Trench became a site of folklore and fear, rumored to be the source of the Leviathan's power and home to unimaginable beasts.\n\"Not possible,\" one councilor stated. \"no person who's ventured there has lower back!\"\n\"That is why we need to head,\" Sophia argued. \"If we don't recognize what we're up in opposition to, we'll be preventing blind.\"\nTharros lifted his hand to silence the room. \"Sofia is correct. This is a chance we should take. And I can lead the day trip myself.\"\n\"No,\" Sophia said firmly. \"I'm going.\"\nThe room went hushed again, astonished by her announcement. Tharros became to her, his face a blend of admiration and concern. \"Sophia, you don't need to\"\n\"Sure, I do,\" she added. \"This is not only about Aquaria. This is about me. My relationship to the Leviathan, to the ocean-it's all related to whatever is down there. I need to recognize it.\nKael stood with his voice steady. \"Then I'm going with you.\"\nTharros followed suit. \"As am I.\"\nArin smirked in her seat. \"Nicely, it appears we have our team. \"This should be thrilling.\"  \nLater that night, Sophia found herself on the royal balcony, staring out at the vast expanse of the sea. The superstars shimmered above, their light reflecting off the tranquil seas, but her thoughts had been anything but peaceful.\nA familiar figure approached, and she turned to see Kael standing a few feet away. His usual confidence was replaced by something quieter and more vulnerable.\n\"I couldn't sleep,\" he explained.\nShe smiled softly and gestured for him to join her. \"Neither ought to I.\"\nThey stood side by side in quiet for a second, the tension from before remaining like a shadow.\n\"Sophia,\" Kael began, his voice low. \"I apologize for how I acted. I let my emotions get ahead of me.\"\nShe looked at him, her expression warm. \"I recognize. However, Kael, we cannot allow our feelings for one another to cloud our judgment. We need to be stronger than that.\"\nHe nodded, his gaze focused on the horizon. \"I simply... I don't want to lose you.\"\n\"You didn't,\" she murmured calmly, placing her hand on his arm. \"But we need to tackle this together. anybody.\"\nBefore he could respond, an unexpected rumble resonated from the waves below. Their eyes widened as the tranquil waves began to churn furiously. A sickly green mild pulsed beneath the surface, becoming brighter with each passing two days.\nTharros appeared in the back of them, his look severe. \"The Leviathan,\" he announced. \"It's stirring again.\"\nKael drew his blade immediately, his protective instincts heightened. \"What's taking place?\"\nSophia grabbed her chest as a sharp anguish surged through her, and the warmth of her connection to the ocean burned stronger. Her voice became barely a whisper, but it was heavy with dread.\n\"It's no longer simply the Leviathan,\" she remarked, her eyes wide with terror. \"some thing else is awakening.\"\nThe Alchemy of the Unknown \nSophia's pulse quickened as the glittering inexperienced light of the water faded into the horizon. She grasped the balcony railing, her mind racing as she attempted to sense the Leviathan's draw. It was no longer just a feeling; it had become a living, continuous bond that grew stronger with each passing second. Her chest constricted. Every instinct told her that the time had come to leave.\nArin's voice lowered as her thoughts spiraled. \"you could sense it, can't you?\" She requested, coming out of the palace's shadows. Her tone softened, yet there was a harsh part beneath it. \"The Leviathan's strength is asking you.\"\nSophia nodded, her voice just above a whisper. \"It's adore, it's the within me. But I don't know what it requires.\"\nArin's face stiffened, her dark eyes gleaming like the ocean's depths. \"Then it's time to find out.\" \"Include me.\nWithout expecting an answer, Arin became and began walking towards the distant end of the castle, her movements practical. Sophia paused for a brief moment before following. The frigid air bit at her pores and skin as they descended into the heart of Arin's mythical grove, which she'd only heard tales of.\nSophia had never seen anything quite like the grove. Towering coral formations pulsed with a subtle, bioluminescent glow, sending shifting patterns of light and shadow over the enormous space. The air seemed alive, charged with a force that made her pores and skin tingle. It wasn't just magic; it transformed into something older, more primordial.\nArin moved toward the center of the grove, her presence imposing. \"That is where the strains blur,\" she explained, pointing to the brilliant coral around them. \"Magic and nature, technological know-how and chaos-all come together here. If we're going to acknowledge your link to the Leviathan, this is the place to do it.\"\nSophia made a timid step forward, her gaze darting over the grove. \"I don't know if I can do this,\" she said. \"Magic is not...logical. It does not follow policies.\nArin smirked, her lips curled into a knowing smile. \"That's where you're mistaken. Magic has its own good judgment-you simply have to focus on it.\"\nSophia grimaced and crossed her fingers. \"and how precisely am I imagined to do this?\"\nArin lifted an eyebrow, her attitude combining relaxation and assignment. \"near your eyes.\"\nSophia hesitated, but eventually obeyed. When her eyes closed, the arena around her appeared to alter. She may want to feel the grove's pulse-a steady, repetitive beat that resonated in her chest. It was weak at first, like the distant crash of waves, but it grew stronger as she targeted more.\n\"desirable,\" Arin said gently. \"Now, give permission to pass on everything you believe you know. Avoid striving to research and instead...experience.\"\nSophia inhaled deeply, feeling the grove's power rush over her. It became unlike anything she had ever experienced: fluid and unpredictable, yet unmistakably alive. It swirled around her like a living thing, brushing against her skin and straining at the edges of her consciousness.\n\"Magic isn't simply power,\" Arin insisted. \"It's intentional. It responds to thoughts, emotions, and instincts. You may not be able to manipulate it, but you can guide it.\"\nSophia exhaled gently, her hands quivering as she reached into the swirling modern. The magic hesitated, darting away like a scared fish, but she kept her actions mild and coaxed it closer. The strands of mild gradually drifted closer to her, surrounding her palms like ribbons.\n\"You're doing it,\" Arin said, her tone tinted with joy. \"Now, hold it regular.\"\nSophia focussed, her heart beating as she tried to maintain the connection. It was both exciting and terrifying, like walking a tightrope across a limitless abyss.\nHours passed as they worked, Sophia's scientific precision blending with Arin's flowing spellwork. They collaborated to produce a hybrid version that struck a delicate balance between structured algorithms and free-flowing mysticism. It was not easy. Sophia's attempts to pin down the magical currents were futile because they were continually altering.\n\"Magic doesn't like being forced,\" Arin informed her, watching as one of Sophia's outfits collapsed in a flash of light. \"you need to adapt to it, not the opposite way round.\"\nSophia grumbled and rubbed her temples. \"this will be so much less difficult if it accompanied some form of pattern.\"\nArin grinned, her voice taunting. Who says it doesn't? Perhaps you're just looking in the wrong spot.\nSophia grimaced, her thoughts racing. What if Arin proved to be right? What if the patterns were altogether different-something natural-rather than linear? She closed her eyes once more and let her mind drift. Slowly, the chaotic currents began to take shape in her mind, connecting with something deeper.\nAnd suddenly she felt it.\nA weak but amazing pulse beats in tune with her heartbeat. It wasn't coming from the grove or the magic around her; it was coming from within.\nSophia's eyes snapped open. \"There is something...inside me. I will sense it.\"\nArin's expression became grim. \"The Leviathan,\" she replied gently. \"Its energy is tied to yours.\"\nSophia's stomach churned as a wave of horror and realization washed over her. \"How? Why?\"\nArin shakes her head. \"I do not comprehend. However, if we recognize the relationship, we may be able to predict-and prevent-its activities.\nSophia's medical knowledge proved useful as they worked on their paintings. She used her hydrodynamics knowledge to map the Leviathan's energy pulses, flawlessly integrating them with Arin's spell matrices. The end result was a shimmering three-dimensional depiction of the sea's currents, with each pulse extending outward like ripples in a pond.\n\"It's heading for the trench,\" Sophia said, her voice tense. \"but why?\"\nArin's gaze clouded. \"The ditch is ancient.\" It's older than Aquaria and the Leviathan itself. It can't be exact about what it's looking for there.\nSophia's chest tightened. The thought of the Leviathan achieving the ditch caused her with fear that she couldn't explain. \"We have to prevent it,\" she insisted forcefully. \"before it's too late.\"\nArin nodded, but her expression remained bleak. \"It's not clean. The closer you get, the stronger your relationship becomes. If you're not careful, it may eat you.\"\nSophia swallowed hard, the weight of Arin's words settling on her. \"Then I'll need to be careful.\"\nSophia noticed something strange while they were packing their equipment. Her arm, where the Leviathan's pulse had been greatest, began to sparkle softly. She drew up her sleeve to reveal a delicate, intricate rune engraved into her skin.\n\"Arin,\" Sophia replied, her voice trembling. \"what's this?\"\nArin's eyes widened, and her usual serenity slipped. \"That...shouldn't be possible.\"\nThe rune pulsed, its glow becoming brighter as Sophia's connection to the energy around her became stronger. It felt alive, like an insignia or a seal, and it burned with such intensity that it became inextricably linked to the Leviathan.\n\"What does it mean?\" Sophia asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\nArin's gaze was distant, and her expression unreadable. \"It method you're extra connected to the abyss than any folks realized.\"\nSophia's pulse raced as the ramifications sank in. The Leviathan was more than just a risk; it had become a part of her, and it would not let her cross.\nThe Dragon’s Choice\nThe rune gleamed softly on Sophia's arm as she exited the grove, her mind jumbled with possibilities she couldn't help but clutch close. Tharros waited for her near the royal gates, his imposing parent highlighted by the delicate bioluminescent glow of the coral streets. His golden eyes searched her, detecting the faint uneasiness she tried to hide.\n\"You've been with Arin,\" he said, his voice calm but questioning.\nSophia nodded and pulled her sleeve down. \"We've made progress. The Leviathan is going into a ditch. \"We think we can track it.\"\nTharros examined her, his expression opaque. \"What about you?\" Did she tell you how perilous this link is?\nSophia's eyes hardened. \"I already recognize. However, this is not about me; it is about each individual.\"\nHis lips form a thin line. \"You're too quick to undergo the weight by myself.\"\n\"And you're too short to think you have to control everything,\" she blasted again, her tone constant but pointed.\nTharros stiffened, a hint of defensiveness crossing his face. \"manipulate is what continues us alive, Sophia.\"\nShe took a step closer, her voice lower but no less company. No, trust is. If we don't start relying on every different, this component will harm us.\"\nFollowing their altercation, Tharros retreated to the palace school grounds, her sentences chasing him like an unbreakable shadow. The vast arena shone softly in the moonlight, its sides covered with the shimmering scales of young dragons eagerly awaiting his teaching. Their wings glinted in the dim lighting, restless and alert.\nHe had trained dozens of them, turning their skills into sharp weapons for Aquaria's protection. These days, however, their intensity irritated him. He stood in the midst of the ring, his imposing presence drowning out their murmurs.\n\"Form ranks,\" he instructed, his tone stern.\nThe younger dragons obeyed, their movements rushed and chaotic. One stumbled over its tail, prompting a pointed scolding from its companion. Tharros frowned, inflammation rising beneath the surface.\n\"Awareness,\" he said abruptly. \"Your energy means nothing with out discipline.\"\nThe dragons froze up, scolded. Tharros sighed privately, his tone rougher than he had expected. He turned his back, his thoughts going to a memory he rarely allowed to surface.\nYears before, Tharros had stood in a similar ring, but on the other side of the command. His father's voice reverberated throughout the neighborhood, each word laden with authority.\n\"strength is the whole lot,\" his father had remarked, marching ahead of the line of younger dragons. \"Strength comes from control. If you can't control your strength, you're susceptible. \"If you percentage it, you're silly.\"",

        "content": "Tharros had watched as his father unleashed a torrent of golden fire, scorching the area's margins. The younger dragons watched in admiration, but Tharros felt a knot form in his chest. Even then, he understood that my own energy wasn't sufficient. However, thinking about his father wasn't an option.\n\"Never rely on others,\" his father told him later, his voice quiet but firm. \"They may simply disappoint you.\" \"Remember that, Son.\"\nTharros had carried those words with him ever since, wearing them as armor. However, standing in this arena, they felt heavier than ever.\nThe juvenile dragons continued their drills under Tharros' careful observation, their movements more focused but still lacking coherence. Certainly one of them, a lesser dragon with silvery scales, strained to keep up. It stumbled, its wing clipping anyone else's tail, and they both collapsed in a tangled mess.\n\"Enough,\" Tharros growled, his determination wavering. He stepped closer to the pair, his golden eyes narrowing. \"What become that?\"\nThe silver dragon looked up, its voice wavering. \"I-i used to be looking to preserve up, sir.\"\nTharros' stare softened briefly before quickly hardening again. \"Merely attempting is insufficient. \"In a real war, hesitation will get you killed.\"\nThe words he spoke felt hollow. He cast a glance at the others, who were annoyed and hesitant. They weren't responding to his authority; they were intimidated by it.\nThe realization stung.\nSophia emerged at the area's threshold, attracting the young dragons' attention. She folded her arms, her look blank as she studied Tharros. He approached her, his frustration seething beneath the floor.\n\"What are you doing here?\" he said, his voice rougher than he expected.\nShe lifted her eyebrow. \"I'm watching you crush them into the floor. \"How is that running out?\"\nTharros' jaws constricted. \"They want the subject. Without it, they will dissolve when it counts.\"\n\"Or maybe they'll fall apart due to the fact they're too afraid to depend upon each other,\" Sophia offered. Her gaze softened, and her voice dropped. \"You want to make them stronger, yet you are isolating them. Similarly, you isolate yourself.\nTharros glanced at her, her words striking a chord he had not anticipated. He wanted to dispute and defend his techniques, but deep down he knew she was correct.\n\"Show me,\" Sophia said, going past him. She spoke to the young dragons, her tone firm but type. \"Pair up. We're going to strive for something unique.\"\nTharros watched as she led them through a new activity, encouraging them to paint together rather than competing. They hesitated at first, unsure of the change in dynamics, but the tension gradually dissipated. The silver dragon, coupled with a larger one, began to discover its rhythm, making its movements smoother and more confident.\nSophia cast another glance toward Tharros, a faint smile pulling at her lips. \"See what takes place when you let them proportion the weight?\"\nHe crossed his palms, reluctant to admit she was correct but unable to deny the outcome.\nLater, Tharros took over the practice, incorporating Sophia's style. He intentionally paired the younger dragons, encouraging them to communicate and encourage one another. His instructions were strange at first because they were given overseas, but as the session went, something changed.\nThe silver dragon, emboldened by its associate's support, unleashed a flash of flame that illuminated the arena. The others cheered, their enthusiasm contagious. Tharros couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as he saw them triumph-no longer as individuals, but as a team.\nFor the first time, he allowed himself to return and let them take the lead. It labored.\nBecause the lesson was over, the young dragons dispersed, their laughter booming over the night air. Tharros stood in the center of the vacant expanse, his thoughts heavy. Sophia approached, her expression sweet yet knowing.\n\"You did true,\" she said confidently.\nTharros sighed and ran a hand through his dark hair. \"It's not smooth, letting move.\"\n\"It's well worth it,\" she said. \"And it's no longer all about them. \"You must also trust yourself.\"\nHer comments lingered as she departed, leaving Tharros alone with his thoughts. He looked up at the stars, which were mildly faint but consistent. For the first time, he felt the weight of his father's lessons ease.\nHowever, the quiet was short-lived. A profound tremor shook the ground beneath his feet, sending ripples through the region. Tharros' eyes widened as he braced himself, his instincts heightened.\nA low, foreboding rumble emerged from the palace's depths, like a growl emanating from the earth itself. It wasn't just a tremor; it turned into a warning.\nTharros' chest tightened as he approached the palace. Anything that was on its way has already arrived.\nKael’s Crossroads\nThe tremor had rattled the palace, and as the others dispersed to assess the damage, Kael remained still, his mind distant. His body moved routinely as he approached the warrior grounds, but his mind was somewhere else-trapped between the obligations of responsibility and the draw of something far more intimate.\nThe Leviathan's oncoming danger loomed on all sides, yet it transformed into Sophia, who ate his psyche. Her recovery, her bravery in the face of insurmountable challenges, had torn him apart in ways he could not explain. But Aquaria came first. It generally did.\nHe entered the educational facility, where his warriors awaited him. Their looks were a mix of determination and anxiety, reflecting the dread that pervaded the entire kingdom. Kael tightened his grasp on the trident by his side and addressed them.\n\"Shape up,\" he screamed, his voice steady despite the mayhem inside. The soldiers stepped into position, and the sound of clinking armor filled the air.\nKael started coaching them through drills, his commands distinctive, his tone sharp. However, his heart was not in it. He observed their actions, observing each fault and pause. They were unprepared for what was to come.\nNeither was he.\nAs the squaddies cycled through their formations, a memory surfaced unexpectedly. Kael observed himself as a boy, standing on the rocks watching the vast expanse of the sea. His father, big and imposing, stood beside him, his attention fixed on the horizon.\n\"You'll recognize someday,\" his father continued, his voice full of conviction. \"Kael, accountability comes first. constantly.\"\nKael, who was younger and more naive, had remarked, \"What if it costs you what you love?\"\nHis father's quiet served as an adequate remedy. Later that night, Kael overheard his parents argue. His mother's speech was a mix of sadness and rage, accusing his father of sacrificing their family for domination. His father didn't deny it.\n\"That's the cost of being a Stormwind,\" his father had explained. \"Love is transient. Obligation is eternal.\nKael had spent his entire attempting to live with the help of those phrases. However, when he stood in the arena, Sophia's face remained in his memory. The way she challenged him, seeing through his shields, made him reconsider all he thought he understood.\n\"Kael!\" one of the infantrymen exclaimed, snapping him back to the moment.\nThe young warrior had faltered during a maneuver, and his guard was heightened in response to his improper attitude. Kael approached him, his rage boiling over.\n\"Once more,\" Kael remarked sternly. \"If you could't get this right, you'll be the primary to fall whilst the Leviathan strikes.\"\nThe soldier's expression stiffened, but he complied. Kael moved aside, swiping a hand through his hair. His father's words weighed heavily on him, yet they no longer felt true. No longer totally.\nLater, when the sun fell below the horizon, Kael was summoned to the council room. He entered and found the elders sat in a semicircle, their countenance solemn.\n\"The Leviathan's energy grows,\" one of them remarked. \"Aquaria should stand unified, its warriors targeted. We do not have the money for distractions.\"\nKael crossed his arms, realizing where this was going. \"What are you saying?\"\nAn elder leaned forward, his eyes piercing. \"You have a bond with Sophia. There's a chance. She is linked to the Leviathan, and while her role is important, your attachment to her separates your mind. You must put dominion first.\"\nKael's jaws constricted. \"And you observed slicing ties with her will make me a higher chief?\"\n\"We assume it will make you a more disciplined individual,\" any other elder stated. \"You have a commitment to Aquaria, Kael. \"Not to her.\"\nThe phrases stung more than Kael wanted to acknowledge. He wanted to argue, to protect what he felt, but decades of ingrained allegiance kept him back. He exited the chamber, their shouts reverberating in his ears.\nHe discovered Sophia in one of the palace gardens, her gaze fixed on the stars. The gentle brightness of the coral lamps illuminated her face, and Kael looked at her for a brief moment. She appeared serene and constant, but he knew what she was carrying.\n\"Kael,\" she said, knowing his presence. She turned to him, her face kind. \"What's wrong?\"\nHe hesitated, then took a step closer. \"The council needs me to distance myself from you.\"\nSophia's eyes widened, but she quickly hid her amazement. \"due to the bond?\"\nHe nodded, his fists squeezing around his eyes. \"They consider it a distraction. That I can't fulfill my obligation if I'm...too close to you.\"\n\"And what do you think?\" She requested, her voice gentle yet steady.\nKael appeared distant, his chest constricting. \"I don't recognise. My entire life, I've been told that obligation comes first. That anything else is a weak point.\"\nSophia drew closer, her gaze unflinching. \"And do you accept as true with that?\"\nKael looked into her eyes, the anguish in his heart reflected in his countenance. \"I'm not sure how to select. I don't see a way to be both.\n\"You do not have to select,\" she stated firmly. \"However, you must determine what is important to you. Now, not to the council, not to your father, but to you.\nHer words hit a chord deep within him, a part of himself that he had long forgotten. He nodded, but the gravity of the decision hung over him.\nThe following morning, Kael returned to the warrior grounds. The infantrymen had already assembled, their weapons glinting in the early light. Kael entered the ring, his trident in hand.\n\"Who's prepared to spar?\" he inquired, his tone dripping with assignment.\nThe young warriors exchanged glances, and one improved-a tall, broad-shouldered merman with a determined gaze. Kael nodded and motioned for him to enter the hoop.\nThe spar began, their movements swift and deliberate. Kael pushed the fighter hard, assessing his reflexes and clearing up. But his own consciousness slipped as Sophia's words echoed in his memory.\n\"Attention!\" the young warrior yelled, capitalizing on Kael's hesitation. His strike landed, sending Kael falling back.\nThe area became silent. Kael steadied himself, tightening his grasp on his trident. He pushed forward, his motions crisper now, and dealt the warrior a decisive blow.\nThe group erupted in cheers, but Kael barely heard them. His indecision had nearly cost him the fight. It served as a strong reminder that he didn't have enough money to divide-neither in struggle nor in life.\nAs the troops left, Kael stayed in the arena, his thoughts heavy. Sophia's words echoed in his mind, her remarks cutting through the noise.\nWhat mattered to him?\nHe understands his father's training, the importance of subculture, and the council's expectations. After that, he thought of Sophia-her electricity, rebellion, and her concept in him.\nKael took a long breath as the answer crystallized in his thoughts. He would not choose between his obligation and his bond with Sophia. He could fight for each, even if it meant rejecting the council and rewriting the policies.\nAs he exited the arena, a tiny vibration rippled across the floor beneath his feet. It became subtle, almost imperceptible, but it sent a shiver down his back. The Leviathan started stirring again, and this time it felt closer.\nKael's remedy hardened. He could deal with whatever awaited him. For his state. For her.\nArin’s Shadows\nArin awoke abruptly, her breath seizing as the black strands of her nightmare clung to her brain. She sat straight in her bed, her chamber illuminated by the strange glow of the bioluminescent coral. Her palms trembled as she pushed them to her chest, hoping to stop the pounding of her heart.\nIn the dream, she stood inside Aquaria's heart, her power unwinding in a flood of disaster. Sophia, Kael, and Tharros were there, their faces filled with betrayal and fear as her strength consumed them. The Leviathan's voice murmured in her ear, a deadly lullaby.\n\"You have been born to destroy,\" it whispered in a seductive tone. \"You can't get away what you're.\"\nArin shuddered and pulled her knees to her chest. The dream had seemed so real, and the darkness so bright. And the worst component? A small part of her had desired it-to let go and embody the turmoil that simmered beneath her skin.\nThe coral tower pulsed slightly as Arin went through it, her bare feet brushing against the cool stone. This became her sanctuary, where magic flowed freely, untamed and uncooked. However, it has recently begun to feel more like a jail. The dividers seemed to close in on her, the air thick with the weight of her own might.\nShe paused in front of the reflect-like pool in the center of the tower, its floor vibrating with dark force. Her reflection peered back at her, but it wasn't her-it was a distorted version of herself, with malevolent eyes and a shadowy torso.\n\"No,\" she said quietly, stepping back. \"That's now not me.\"\nHowever, the reflection did not waver. As a substitute, it smiled, a cold, vicious expression that sent a chill down her spine.\n\"You couldn't run from this,\" it replied, its voice reverberating in her mind. \"you could't hide.\"\nArin grew distant, her arms tightened into fists. She had spent her entire life learning about and controlling her magic. But now it is sliding away from her, corroding all it touches. The darkness was spreading, and he or she had no idea how to stop it.\nDays are passed in solitary. Arin stopped the others, her attention fed by her attempts to seal away her energy. She constructed ward after ward, constructing complex spells to absorb the power. However, the more she attempted to resist it, the more intense it became.\nThe coral walls began to wither, their vibrant brightness fading into a dismal grey. The air became cooler, and the once-luminous tower dimmed under the weight of her spell. It was as if the darkness began to feed on her anxiety, thriving on her desperation.\nArin dropped to the floor, her power depleted. She leaned her head against the bloodless stone, her thoughts twisted. She was losing control. And if she can't stop it, she might become the very thing she's afraid of-a destructive weapon.",

        "content": "A gentle knock on the door broke through her misery. She did not pass, hoping that whoever it was would depart. However, the door cracked open and a familiar voice filled the room.\n\"Arin.\"\nSophia walked inside, her gaze scouring the gloomy, damaged surroundings. Her gaze settled on Arin, and her countenance softened with challenge.\n\"You've been hiding,\" Sophia replied, her tone calm but firm. \"What's taking place?\"\n\"Not anything,\" Arin mumbled, her voice scratchy. \"I'm first-class.\"\nSophia crossed her hands, unimpressed. \"You are no longer pleasant. Examine the surrounding area. \"It's falling apart.\"\nArin turned away, embarrassment tightening in her chest. \"I'm dealing with it.\"\n\"No, you're not,\" Sophia said, crouching alongside her. \"You're pushing everybody away. Whatever it is, you shouldn't have to deal with it alone.\nArin's eyes welled with tears, but she refused to let them fall. \"You don't recognize,\" she exclaimed, her voice shaking. \"I can't control it anymore. It spreads and corrupts everything. If I let it pass, I will hurt you. \"I'll hurt you all.\"\nSophia reached out and placed a hand on Arin's shoulder. \"You are no longer going to harm us. But if you keep this up, you may end up hurting yourself.\nArin's shields cracked, and she or he exhaled a quivering breath. \"I saw it,\" she said. \"In my goals. I betrayed you. The Leviathan manipulated me, and I let it. \"I became a monster.\"\nSophia's grasp on her shoulder tightened. \"That's not who you are,\" she insisted vehemently. \"You are greater than your magic, Arin. \"You are greater than your fears.\"\nArin returned her look, tears finally pouring over. \"How do you recognize?\"\n\"Because I've seen you fight,\" Sophia stated, her voice steady. \"Not only for Aquaria, but for all of us. For yourself. You're more powerful than you realize. and that I will not aid you in surrendering now.\"\nArin stood up, assisted by Sophia. They began to weave a new spell-one of transformation rather than suppression. Sophia directed her, their energies combining as they worked.\n\"Magic isn't just about manipulation,\" Sophia explained. \"It's all about balance. You don't need to fight it. You need to embody it.\nArin paused, her hands quivering. \"What if i can't?\"\n\"You may,\" Sophia answered, her voice steady. \"I consider in you.\"\nArin closed her eyes, letting go of her worries. She reached deep inside herself and touched the center of her magic. The blackness surged, wild and uncontrollable, yet she did not pull back. As an alternative, she welcomed it and allowed it to flow through her.\nThe space was filled with light and shadow, the two forces whirling together in perfect harmony. The withering coral began to sparkle again, its vibrant hues returning. The air became hotter, and the oppressive weight lifted as the spell was cast.\nWhen it was ended, Arin opened her eyes. The pool in the center of the room shone with a smooth, silvery light, its surface tranquil and pristine. The darkness was still there, but it did not feel like a menace. It felt like it was a part of her, one that she should eventually accept.\nAs they stood within the repaired tower, a melancholy music filled the atmosphere. It became weak, almost invisible, but it sent shivers down their spines. Sophia's forehead furrowed as Arin grew to become her.\n\"Do you pay attention to that?\" she said.\nSophia nodded, her face tight. \"what's it?\"\nArin's gaze turned to the pool, where the surface rippled gently. The song became louder, more urgent, as if appealing to something-or someone.\n\"It's a caution,\" Arin said quietly. \"something's coming.\"\nDefense Innovations\nSophia stood in the royal lab, her palms tracing the crystalline pattern of the console in front of her. The gap buzzed with power, a perfect blend of Aquaria's old magic and the present era. Bioluminescent panels flickered along the partitions, illuminating the finely carved runes, which pulsed with pale blue light.\nThe lab sprang to life, but it also caused tension in the room.\nKael rested against the furthest wall, his hands crossed, watching Sophia and Arin fumble with the prototype in the center of the room. His stare was piercing, but his usual self-assurance was tinted with uneasiness. Tharros paced close by, his golden eyes scrutinizing the diagrams projected above the console as his fury grew. They had been at this for hours, and the weight of their mission rested heavily on them.\n\"We want something that works,\" Tharros said, breaking the silence. \"The Leviathan isn't going to look forward to us to parent this out.\"\nSophia didn't look up, her focus steady. \"We're near. However, this is more than just speed; it must also be proper.\"\nSophia's goal for the project was to create a hybrid defensive machine that combined the best of Aquaria's magic with cutting-edge foreign technology. Arin was essential in constructing the paranormal foundation, creating spell matrices that could detect the tainted strength emanating from Leviathan-spawned monsters. Kael had redesigned his army tactics to include magical shields into traditional formations, while Tharros had provided the sheer power they needed to combat the corruption.\nHowever, combining their strengths had not been clean. Each brought a unique perspective, and their personal methods frequently clashed.\n\"Try adjusting the resonance discipline,\" Arin advised, her palms glowing faintly as she imbued the console with a blast of power. The prototype, a shimmering sphere intended to function as magical sonar, pulsed in response, sending forth waves of strength that reverberated around the room.\nSophia grimaced, tapping abruptly on the console's crystalline interface. \"The sector is quite volatile. \"If we push it further, it may overload.\"\n\"It won't if you let the magic flow instead of forcing it,\" Arin responded, her tone sharp.\nKael moved forward with a calm but firm tone. \"What happens if it doesn't remain in conflict? \"The soldiers will be exposed.\"\n\"That's why we're testing it,\" Sophia remarked, her voice rising with frustration. She took a step back and ran a hand through her hair. \"We're now not going to get this ideal on the primary strive.\"\n\"Then let me give it a push,\" Tharros said, his voice piercing through the growing tension. He approached the prototype, his golden eyes narrowing as flames began to flicker over his fingertips. \"We need to peer how it holds up below real pressure.\"\n\"Wait-\" Sophia started, but Tharros had already fired a controlled burst of dragonfire toward the orb.\nThe area was flooded with a dazzling flash of light as the orb absorbed the energy and intensified its brightness. For a second, it turned to paintings-the waves of magic had stabilized, resonating in perfect harmony with the times.\nBut suddenly the brilliance dimmed, becoming a putrid green. Sophia's spine shivered as she felt the subsequent electrical pulse.\n\"Close it down!\" she yelled.\nArin moved quickly and dispelled the charm with a pointed motion. The sphere dimmed, its power fading to a quiet hum. The room fell hushed, the weight of their impending failure settling on them.\nSophia sighed deeply, her fingers twitching. \"It amplified the Leviathan's have an impact on in preference to suppressing it.\"\nTharros' jaws constricted. \"Then we will strive once more. We don't have time to stay in this.\"\nSophia turned to him, her voice steady but forceful. \"If we do not get this right, we will end up making matters worse. \"We cannot rush this.\"\nThe crew gathered, everyone putting their recognition into resolving the fault. Arin redesigned the spell matrices, altering the flow of magic to prevent amplification. Sophia delicately adjusts the algorithms, using safeguards to stabilize the resonance subject. Kael evaluated defense configurations, ensuring that the machine could withstand both magical and physical attacks.\nAs they worked, the fear subsided, replaced by a peaceful determination. Each of them brought their specific strengths to the table, and the parts gradually began to fit together.\n\"We're getting somewhere,\" Arin said, her voice filled with cautious confidence. \"The magic is holding regular this time.\"\nSophia nodded, her fingers speeding across the panel. \"permit's take a look at the sonar once more.\"\nKael improved with his trident in hand. \"I'll trigger the simulation.\"\nHe activated a panel on the wall, and the chamber altered, with the crystalline systems morphing into a holographic battleground. Corrupted marine animals emerged, their movements unpredictable and disturbing. The prototype orb pulsed, releasing waves of electricity that lit the creatures in stunning clarity.\n\"It's running,\" Sophia replied, her voice tinged with relief. \"we will see their moves, even via the interference.\"\nTharros approached the orb, his gold eyes gleaming. \"permit's see how it handles this.\"\nHe launched another controlled stream of dragonfire, and this time the orb absorbed the energy without destabilizing. The magic waves grew stronger, forming a protective barrier shimmering with golden mild.\nKael advanced quickly, testing the defense with a series of hits from his trident. The barrier held, deflecting the attacks with ease.\n\"It's retaining,\" Kael said with a rare smile bursting through his usual stoicism. \"We've were given some thing.\"\nTheir solution, however, proved to be temporary. As they deactivated the device, a tiny tremor rippled across the facility, followed by an unsettling silence. The room's bioluminescent panels darkened, and a low, resonant hum permeated the air.\n\"what is that?\" Arin inquired, her voice stressed.\nThe hum intensified, and the lab's crystalline walls began to glow with an unnatural, unfamiliar light. Sophia's heart raced as she identified the tint, which had taken on the putrid tinge that had previously contaminated the ball.\n\"The Leviathan,\" she muttered. \"It's reacting to the prototype.\"\nA piercing crack reverberated across the room as one of the crystalline panels cracked, sending pieces flying. Kael moved immediately, sheltering Sophia with his body as the shards clattered to the ground.\n\"We ought to shut the whole thing down,\" Tharros replied, his voice stern. \"Now.\"\nArin moved abruptly, eliminating the lingering charm as Sophia turned off the console. The hum subsided, but the sense of dread lingered.\nSophia looked at the others, her demeanor somber. \"It's no longer enough.\" The technology works, but it attracts the Leviathan's notice. If we start it within the field, we may be able to direct it right to us.\"\nThe group stood silently, the weight of the revelation bearing down on them. They had made progress, but it wasn't sufficient. Now, not yet.\nSophia clenched her hands and her mind raced. \"We're lacking something,\" she added. \"something which could counteract the Leviathan's have an effect on without amplifying it.\"\nArin nodded, her brow wrinkled. \"We will figure it out. \"We should.\nA faint glow drew their attention to a corner of the facility, where a small pool sparkled with silvery light. It became a hallowed swimming pool, a remnant of Aquaria's past. The water rippled, and a soft voice resonated across the room.\n\"Time is short,\" it declared, the words carrying an otherworldly weight. \"The abyss stirs, and the bond must maintain.\"\nSophia's breath caught, and the warning sent a shiver down her spine. She looked at her friends, whose looks mirrored her concern. They didn't have much time left.\nFirst Strikes  \nThe seas near Aquaria's boundaries churned abnormally, their bioluminescent brilliance drowned out by a creeping blackness. Kael stood on the edge of the reef, trident in hand, gaze scanning the vast expanse. His troops had been hidden behind him, their armor reflecting the faint glimmer of the remaining light. The air felt thick and oppressive, like if something dreadful was waiting just beyond sight.\nA distant rumble reached his ears, followed by a chilly silence. Kael's grip on the weapon intensified. The Leviathan was no longer waiting.\nTharros' dragon form loomed behind him, its golden scales glinting slightly in the subdued light. \"It's starting,\" Tharros said, his deep voice tinged with panic. \"They're testing us.\"\nKael nodded. \"And we're geared up.\"\nHowever, as he spoke, uncertainty crept in. The prototype device Sophia and Arin had developed was not ideal, and the council's cautions about diversions lingered in his memory. His attention shifted to Sophia, who stood near the sonar instrument, her palms flying across the panel. She became the key in their scheme, but she was also the most vulnerable.\nThe first wave struck without caution. Shadowed documents surged through the water, their shapes altered by writhing tendrils of tainted energy. The monsters had been horrific, part fish, part element horror, with glowing eyes fixed on the Aquarian warriors.\n\"maintain the road!\" Kael demanded, his voice cutting through the confusion.\nThe troops advanced as one, their shields locking together to form a barrier. Kael raced forward, his trident cutting through the first beast with accuracy. Black ichor sprayed across the river, hissing as it hit his troops' enchanted armor.\nTharros released a torrent of dragonfire, its golden light illuminating the darker sea. The flames enveloped many creatures, sending screeches echoing across the depths as they dissolved.\n\"For now,\" Tharros mumbled, his attention riveted on the looming shadow in the horizon. The Leviathan wasn't far away, making its presence felt even when it wasn't there.\nArin hovered above the battlefield, her hands gleaming with dark strength as she formed a protective ward around the warriors. The barrier shimmered, returning the flood of animals that banged against it. But each hit damaged her magic, and the cracks spread like spiderwebs.\nSophia's voice crackled over the communications. \"Arin, I need more time! \"The sonar is picking up something-it's no longer just these creatures.\"\nArin gritted her teeth, her electricity fading. \"Whatever you're doing, do it faster. \"I can't keep this for all time.\"\nThe strain in Arin's voice conveyed a stab of remorse through Sophia. She worked furiously, her fingers blurring as she changed the sonar's settings. The gadget hummed, its waves rippling through the water, highlighting the creatures' weak points in flashes of glittering light.\n\"There!\" Sophia shouted. \"intention for the core-it's destabilizing their energy!\"\nKael relayed the order, and his infantrymen adjusted their movements. The tide began to rise as the creatures fell more easily, their warped documentation dissolving in the sea. However, the win was fleeting.\nA thundering boom rippled through the sea, shaking the reef's base. Tharros stiffened, his eyes narrowing as the water surrounding him became warmer.\n\"It's the Leviathan,\" he hissed. \"It's looking.\"\nSophia's chest tightened. \"It's reacting to the dragonfire,\" she realized with shaking voice. \"Tharros, stop using it!\"\nHe paused, his instincts conflicting with her prudence. The dragonfire evolved into their most powerful weapon, but if it attracted the Leviathan closer...\n\"Pull again,\" Kael said, his voice fierce. \"We'll preserve them with shields and spears.\"\nTharros returned to his human form, his visage aggravated. \"This is not sufficient. We're keeping them away, but they're looking into us. and that they are mastering.\nThe next wave was more tough and quicker. The corrupted creatures moved with terrifying coordination, focusing their attacks on vulnerable areas inside the Aquarian structure. Kael fought from the front, his movements accurate but restricted. His thoughts kept returning to Sophia, who had been discovered near the sonar instrument.\nA beast broke through the line and headed straight for her. Kael's coronary heart stopped. Without hesitation, he abandoned his duty and launched himself for Sophia. His trident hit real, piercing the creature's middle before it could reach her.\nSophia looked up, surprised. \"What are you doing, Karl?\" \"You're needed on the front!\"\n\"You had been uncovered,\" he said, his voice taut. \"I couldn't chance-\"\n\"Kael, I can handle myself,\" she interrupted, her tone confident. \"You need to steer them.\"\nHer words were hurtful, but she learned to be proper. Kael returned to the line, guilt nagging at him as he resumed his responsibilities. His hesitancy had cost them ground, and the infantrymen had been struggling to hold the line.\nArin's barrier eventually failed, the magical shield crumbling with a resounding crack. The monsters raced forward, their motions becoming more frantic now that safety was vanished.\n\"I can't keep this up,\" Arin said, her voice straining. Her vitality was almost drained, and the evil within her threatened to consume her entirely.\n\"Then fall lower back,\" Tharros instructed, his voice dominating. \"We'll cover you.\"\nBut Arin shook her head, summoning the last of her force. \"No. \"I am no longer executed, but.\"\nShe raised her fingers, sending her magic into the ocean. Tendrils of dark energy exploded across the creatures, ensnaring and dragging them into the depths. It became a hazardous pass, pushing her dangerously near to the brink of control.\nSophia's sonar instrument began to light brighter, and its buzz became more intense. The corrupted creatures paused, their movements irregular, as the sonar's pulses disturbed their vigor. Sophia's voice came through the speakers, full of urgency.\n\"They're withdrawing!\" she exclaimed. \"But this doesn't feel right. \"It is too smooth.\"\nKael's eyes narrowed. \"What do you imply?\"\nSophia hesitated, her eyes locked on the sonar readout. \"Those creatures...they're only scouts. The true pressure remains accessible.\"\nHer comments sent a shudder through the gathering. The war wasn't over-not even close.\nBecause the last of the animals had dissolved into the sea, the group gathered near the sonar gadget. The surrounding area became eerily quiet, with the bioluminescent glow returning to the reef in faint places.\nSophia stared at the tool, her countenance grim. \"The Leviathan's impact is spreading quicker than we expected. If this was just a glance at, we'd be in serious trouble.\"\nTharros placed a hand on her shoulder, his expression stern. \"Then we must prepare. \"No extra half-measures.\"\nArin nodded, her tiredness visible but her remedy unwavering. \"Something is coming, and we will confront it. collectively.\"\nKael maintained silence, his gaze fixed on the horizon. The shadow of the Leviathan drew closer, weighing heavily on his mind. He knew the upcoming conflict would test them in ways they could not have predicted.\nFragile Alliances\nThe neutral region shone beneath the bioluminescent glow of hovering coral spires. It was an uncomfortable assessment of the worry in the water. Sophia's heart raced as she entered the collection of Aquaria's opposing clans. The currents around her seemed to carry the weight of long-held grudges and unspoken hostility. Each party occupied its own segment of the coral amphitheater, obstructing the others as if millennia of mistrust had been compressed into a single moment.\nKael walked beside her, his trident firmly in hand, his regal ancestry as a mer warrior prince lending gravitas to their presence. His jaw tightened, worry coursing through him like an undercurrent. Arin took a step back, her dark magic creating thin tendrils around her arms. The Shark clan's emissary gave her a stern glance, but swiftly turned aside as Arin's golden eyes met his. Tharros, still recovering from their earlier war, remained in the background in Aquaria. Sophia took over as the leader.\n\"You recognize they'll check us,\" Kael whispered. His voice became low yet firm, his protective attitude barely hidden. \"and you don't have to do that on my own.\"\nSophia flashed him a quick smile, despite her nervousness screaming otherwise. \"We're stronger together,\" she responded, her voice firm. \"however this is something I need to show to them and to myself.\"\nThe Shark clan leader, an implementing parent with jagged scars on his scaled palms, moved forward. His voice sliced through the water like a razor. \"Dr. Sophia Rodriguez is a surface dweller turned Aquarian. You dare to seek alliances among those you know nothing about?\"\nMurmurs of agreement echoed around the amphitheater. Sophia's heart increased, but she held her ground. \"I may be new to your international,\" she started, raising her voice to match the challenge, \"but I am not new to the fight for survival. We faced the forces of the Leviathan together. Together, we can assure its defeat. \"Divided, we will all fall.\"\nThe chief's black gaze narrowed. \"The sentences are moderately priced, outsider. \"Prove your worth.\"\nKael advanced, his trident gleaming. \"She has nothing to show to you.\"\nSophia rested a hand on his arm, her touch gentle but forceful. \"Kael,\" she spoke gently. \"permit me.\"\nThe Shark's extended family chief grinned, his jagged teeth shining. \"thoroughly. An ordeal, then. We'll see if you're strong and foxy enough to steer. Fail, and you will leave this place in disgrace.\"\nSophia nodded, despite a kickback coursing through her. \"call your trial.\"\nHe indicated a black pit beyond the amphitheater. \"The Abyssal Gauntlet.\" Retrieve the pink pearl from the depths. However, proceed with caution. \"Few who input ever return.\"\nKael's hand tightened on his trident. \"This is insanity!\" he exclaimed. \"You're sending her to her death.\"\nArin's voice became chilly, and her magic swirled more noticeably. \"If she doesn't return, none of you may stay to see the Leviathan's reign.\"\nSophia silenced them all with a gaze. \"I'll do it,\" she replied, her voice steady. \"However, now not for you,\" she said, locking eyes with the Shark extended family chief. \"I'll do it for Aquaria.\"\nThe pit loomed before her, a cavernous maw of blackness that appeared to absorb the modest bioluminescent glow of the nearby waters. Sophia's breathing became shallow as she descended, and each action seemed premeditated. The stress increased with each stroke, and the quiet was stifling.\nShe may wish to sense the abnormal and chaotic transfer of currents. Her thoughts turned to Kael and Arin, their fear imprinted on their faces as she left. However, this became her trial, her opportunity to demonstrate that she was more than just a surface scientist. She has become a part of Aquaria.\nAn unusual movement caught her attention. A thing emerged from the shadows, its appearance deformed and unnatural-a tangled combination of scales and tendrils. Sophia felt her heart rush as its brilliant gaze fixed on her.\nShe evaded its initial thrust, her instincts sharper than she expected. She drew a little blade from her belt and attacked, the blade plunging into its sloped underbelly. The thing thrashed, its tendrils wrapping around her wrist, but she pulled free, her determination outweighing her fear.\nAs she descended, the water became colder and blackness engulfed her. Her sonar equipment pulsed slightly, directing her toward the purple pearl. It rested amid a bed of jagged coral, its brightness dim but clear.\nAny other shadow moved just as her arms caressed the gem. This time, it became larger and more ominous. A second beast, its fanged maw gaping, rushed up to her. Sophia's heart raced as she clutched the pearl tightly and turned to face it.\n\"Come on,\" she murmured, barely audible. \"I'm now not leaving without this.\"\nThe battle became furious, her blade striking true, but the creature's durability disconcerting. Just as it appeared she would falter, an unexpected flare of light illuminated the chasm. Arin's black and swirling power engulfed the beast, pulling it deeper. Sophia looked up to see Arin floating above, her countenance angry.\n\"I assumed you'd want a hand,\" Arin said, her tone nonchalant despite the strain in her voice.\nSophia's chest constricted in thankfulness. \"I had it under manipulate,\" she said with a slight smile.\nArin smirked. \"Of path you did.\"\nOnce they emerged from the chasm, the amphitheater fell silent. Sophia held the purple pearl aloft, her gaze steady as she presented it to the Shark extended family chief. His smirk faded, replaced by something comparable to admiration.\n\"You've accomplished what few ought to,\" he confessed grudgingly. \"possibly you're worth in any case.\"\nBefore Sophia could react, a wave of anxiety rippled across the crowd. The water deepened, and an uncanny calm settled over them. From the shadows appeared a man dressed in flowing inky black robes. The Leviathan's envoy.\nGasps echoed around the amphitheater as the emissary's rich, powerful voice filled the space. \"Fools,\" it remarked. \"You argue about alliances as the Leviathan's strength grows. Your camaraderie is a transitory illusion.\"\nSophia progressed, and her dread transformed into defiance. \"Then allow us to display you what solidarity can do.\"\nThe emissary's laughter turned to chilly, sending shivers down her spine. \"We will see,\" it said before disappearing into the shadows.\nThe hush that was witnessed became deafening. Sophia turned to face the assembled factions, her voice steady despite the panic in her breast. \"The Leviathan's emissary is right approximately one component,\" she argued. \"By ourselves, we are defenseless. \"But together, we stand a hazard.\"\nThere was a moment of indecision. The factions then advanced one by one, their cautious but firm nods of agreement. The union became weak, but it was the beginning.\nAs they dispersed, Kael's hand found hers, his touch firm and reassuring. \"You did it,\" he stated gently.\nSophia's attention shifted to the horizon, as the Leviathan's shadow grew closer. \"That is just the beginning,\" she muttered.\nAnd deep within her, a fire ignited-not of worry, but of solution. Something was ahead of her, and she was ready to face it. Together, they could face anything.",

        "content": "But as the waters moved, a malevolent tide carried a terrible reality. The Leviathan's next move would break more than alliances. It might peer into their innermost souls.\nWhispers of Chaos\nThe capital of Aquaria hummed with restless electricity. The bioluminescent streets, normally bright with the smooth glow of teeming life, appeared muted. Whispers slithered through the currents, bringing uncertainty and fear into every corner of the undersea country. Even if the coalition was strong, the Leviathan's shadow loomed greater than ever.\nSophia swam through the town with Kael and Arin. Her bioluminescent styles flickered softly, indicating her tiredness. She hadn't fully recovered from the ordeal inside the chasm, but there wasn't time to relax. The Leviathan became unsatisfied with indirect attacks. The ambassadors had come.\n\"They're already inside the metropolis,\" Kael whispered, his grip on his trident tightening. \"We're past due.\"\nArin's gaze shifted to the darkness, her golden irises blazing faintly alongside her power. \"Not overdue.\" It's simply no longer early enough.\"\nSophia's stomach knotted as she heard fragments of conversation from surrounding Aquarians. \"Why should we believe the Shark extended family?\" one wondered. Some others muttered, \"The surface dweller-she'll bring spoil to us all.\" The sentences were subtle yet cutting, chipping away at the delicate unity that they had worked so hard to establish.\nA previous ruckus piqued their interest. A small crowd had gathered near a coral archway, their voices agitated and angry. Sophia pushed through, with Kael and Arin protecting her.\nIn the center stood a shrouded discern with its face concealed. The determine's voice became low and clear, like the draw of a dangerous present day. \"Your leaders have failed you,\" it stated. \"They would alternatively ally with enemies than protect their personal.\"\nThe crowd muttered in agreement as their confusion grew.\nSophia stepped forward, her voice cutting through the noise. \"Sufficient!\" the gang grew to become to her, with some moving back in astonishment and others glaring with suspicion. \"You are being manipulated. \"Do not let fear divide us.\"\nThe shrouded figure inclined her head, as if amused. \"Will you recognize, outsider? You, who unleashed the Leviathan's wrath on us?\"\nSophia's heart raced, but she held her ground. \"I came here to fight for Aquaria, no longer in opposition to it.\" The Leviathan preys on our section. \"If we collapse, we will have already lost.\"\nThe discerner's chortle was chilly. \"Courageous words.\" However, phrases obtained will not save you.\nBefore Sophia could react, the father disappeared into the currents, leaving the audience perplexed and anxious. Kael's hand moved to her shoulder swiftly. \"That wasn't just some troublemaker. That was considered one of them.\nSophia nodded, her chest tightening. \"Leviathan's emissaries. They're causing concern... And it's working.\"\nTharros paced across the royal chambers, his dragon-like charisma scarcely restrained. The news of the emissaries' infiltration nagged at him. His attention focused on the holographic map of Aquaria's districts, each marked with mounting dissatisfaction.\n\"Sophia shouldn't be accessible,\" he hissed. \"She's too uncovered.\"\nThe message swam in, his expression fading. \"We uncovered a plot against Dr. Rodriguez, Your Majesty. \"Assassins are moving through the Coral market as we speak.\"\nTharros froze over, his golden eyes blazing. \"Mobilize the guards.\" \"I'm going by myself.\"\nThe messenger hesitated. \"however, sire\"\n\"Now!\" Tharros thundered, causing the room to tremble with the force of his authority. He transformed into a dragon, his scales shining like molten gold, and flew through the royal hallways, leaving a path of chaotic currents in his wake.\nSophia, Kael, and Arin had just exited the packed district when a shadow crept closer to them. Kael's trident came up just in time to deflect the sword intended at Sophia's heart.\n\"Assassins!\" he yelled, pushing Sophia into the back of him.\nThe fight began in a blur. The assassins moved at an uncanny pace, their attacks synchronized and deadly. Arin used her magic, snaring one attacker and tossing him against the coral wall. But for every one who stopped, every other seemed to appear.\nSophia's heart raced in her ears as she dodged a swipe aiming at her head. Her scientific mind shouted at her to analyze and compute a solution, but the turmoil left no room for reflection. She pulled her little, sharp blade and sliced at the next attacker, just nicking their arm.\nA dazzling blast of golden light lit the battlefield. Tharros roared into battle, his dragon form cutting through the assassins with terrible precision. His appearance turned the tide, and the ultimate assailants retreated into the shadows.\nTharros transformed back into human form, his chest heaving. He grasped Sophia's shoulders, his eyes burning. \"Are you hurt?\"\nShe shook her head, despite the fact that her hands trembled. \"I'm excellent.\"\nHis grip tightened. \"you could have been killed.\"\n\"However, I wasn't,\" she responded, her voice stronger than she felt. \"We cannot masquerade, Tharros. If we're going to win, we need to confront this head on.\"\nHis jaw tensed, but he nodded. \"Then we do it collectively.\"\nSophia thereafter worked tirelessly in her laboratory. Her connection to the Leviathan became a double-edged sword, and she or he intended to use it. With Arin's assistance, she planned a scheme to allure the diplomats. It became volatile, but they had run out of choices.\nArin observed her with a mixture of adoration and concern. \"You are pushing yourself too hard,\" she replied quietly.\nSophia did not look up. \"If we don't stop them now, it won't count.\"\nKael entered with a sour expression. \"It's time.\"\nSophia nodded, her arms quivering as she turned on the instrument. Pulses of power rippled out, invisible yet powerful, intended to trap the messengers in their location. She could feel the Leviathan's influence rising within her, a chilly, invasive presence that made her pores and skin crawl.\nThe emissaries arrived, drawn as moths to a flame. Shadowy beings appeared within the lab, their bureaucracy fluid and unnatural. The trap was activated, and obstacles of light and magic appeared to keep them contained. However, the Leviathan's energy became more powerful than they had imagined.\nSophia's body felt like it was on fire as she channeled her connection to the Leviathan and used it to weaken the messengers. Her eyesight clouded, and each nerve screamed in protest. The shadows writhed, their outlines fading as the air tightened around them. The emissary then disintegrated, emitting a silent cry.\nSophia sank to the ground, her bioluminescent patterns flickering erratically. Kael got fixated on her facet, his hands trembling as he lifted her. \"Sophia! \"Live with me!\"\nHer eyes flickered open, distracted. \"It's not over,\" she muttered.\nA voice rang from deep within her thoughts. Bloodless, frightening, and all too recognizable.\n\"You can not get away me.\"\nAs darkness enveloped her, the words sent a sigh of relief through her soul.\nFusion of Realms\nSophia's knees hit the lab floor with a foolish thud. Her chest heaved as she struggled to breathe normally, but the faint hum of the Leviathan's voice persisted in her mind. Kael appeared at her side, his strong arms grasping her palms and stabilizing her shivering body.\n\"You're pushing too hard,\" he said, his voice tight with annoyance and tinged with concern.\nSophia shook her head, forcing herself up. \"Kael, we don't have the posh to maintain back. \"Every second we waste makes it stronger.\"\nTharros stood at the entrance of the room, his molten gold eyes narrowing. He was observing her, but his concentration seemed to be elsewhere, as if he was considering a decision he hadn't yet dared to express. Arin, sat on the opposite side, twirled a strand of her jet black hair in her hands. Her face became inscrutable, but the tightness in her stance told volumes.\nThe bioluminescent walls of the lab flickered, projecting ghostly patterns on the sleek device Sophia had added from the floor. Wires entwined with charmed crystals, a chaotic fusion of science and magic-a symbol of the delicate partnership they were attempting to form.\n\"Any other surge like that,\" Tharros eventually muttered, breaking the horrific stillness, \"and also you'll burn yourself out.\"\nSophia ignored him, her gaze fixed on the flickering prototype in the center of the room. A protective grid powered by nanotechnology and imbued with magical potency pulsed unevenly, its gentleness reflecting the agony of its designers.\n\"We want to stabilize the middle,\" she said resolutely. \"without balance, this issue won't preserve against the Leviathan.\"\nArin let out a pointed snigger. \"stability? Among magic and generation? That's like expecting the seas to bow to the celebs.\"\nSophia grew closer to her, confronting her defiance head on. \"Then we make it bow.\"\nThe following morning, the lab was buzzing with activity. Kael and Arin worked in unpleasant silence, tuning the mystical conduits while Tharros watched the electricity output. Sophia, despite her tiredness, walked between stations with unwavering determination.\n\"maintain the power tiers beneath seventy percentage,\" she told him. \"If we cross better-\"\n\"-the system collapses, yes, we recognize,\" Arin said, her tone impatient. \"but inform me, Dr. Genius, how will we manage that after the center keeps rejecting the nanotech?\"\nSophia did not provide an instant remedy. Her thoughts raced, analyzing every failure and blunder. The Leviathan's whispers pierced the borders of her thoughts, a terrifying reminder of what they had been up against.\nKael looked at her, a dilemma carved into his functions. \"Sophia, we do not have the cash for any further disintegration. \"What is your plan?\"\nShe took a long breath, forced herself to focus. \"We're going about this the wrong way. The nanotech isn't rejecting the magic; it's simply opposing it since it doesn't identify it. \"If we can program it to mimic magical patterns rather than override them-\"\n\"application magic?\" Arin snorted. \"You clearly are insane.\"\nSophia's lips curved into a slight smile. \"Coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment.\"\nThe move forward came hours later, amid the peaceful buzz of darkness. Sophia sat pass-legged on the ground, surrounded by a sea of shimmering projections. Her hands moved quickly across her keyboard, writing algorithms that danced between technology and sorcery.\nArin approached with caution, her keen wit softened by curiosity. \"What are you doing?\"\nSophia whispered, \"Teaching the Nanotech to Listen,\" without looking up.\nArin crouched alongside her, peering at the flickering code. \"It won't paintings.\"\nSophia eventually met her gaze. \"It has to.\"\nThe next check proved to be their final opportunity. The prototype hummed with power, and its center shone with an ethereal brilliance. Sophia stood ahead of it, her heart racing as she triggered the system.\nThe room was enveloped in a dazzling brightness as the grid sprang to life. Lines of mild extended across the partitions, generating troublesome patterns that pulsed in unison. For a brief, stunning moment, it worked.\nIt did not continue after that.\nThe glow dimmed, flickered, and eventually died. The middle sputtered, causing a shockwave that sent everyone sprawling. Sparks flew, and the air became thick with the acrid odor of failure.\nSophia drove herself up, coughing. \"What came about?\"\nArin's voice grew sharper. \"Your treasured tech rejected the spell. again.\"\nKael slammed his fist into the wall. \"We don't have time for this!\"\n\"sufficient.\" Tharros' voice cuts through the tumult like a razor. He advanced, his presence commanding. \"Sophia, what are we missing?\"\nSophia clenched her fists, her mind racing. The Leviathan's murmurs intensified, taunting her and condemning her failure. And then, through the noise, readability emerged.\n\"Emotion,\" she whispered.\nArin frowned. \"What?\"\nSophia became to her, her eyes bright with purpose. \"Magic is more than just power; it is also about emotion. intent. \"Nanotech cannot replicate that.\"\nTharros furrowed his brow. \"Then how will we bridge the gap?\"\nSophia moved toward the center, her fingers trembling. \"We do not. We use it. \"Let the magic guide the tech.\"",

        "content": "The final check was unlike any before it. Sophia stood in the center, arms resting on the blazing middle. Kael, Arin, and Tharros formed a protective circle around her, feeding their combined energies into the system.\n\"Cognizance,\" Sophia said, her voice steady despite the maelstrom screaming within her. \"sense the connection.\"\nThe room was bursting with enthusiasm. Magic streamed through the grid, combining with nanotech in a symphony of light and strength. The air crackled with intensity as the machine stabilized, shining brighter than ever before.\nSophia sensed the Leviathan's presence rise within her, a cold, invasive pressure that threatened to crush her. She clinched her enamel, directing the lightning and bending it to her will.\nThe center pulsed once or twice, and then-\nIt held.\nCheers erupted, but Sophia did not heed. She staggered lower back, her imagination and foresight swirling. Kael caught her before she fell, his hands steadying her shaking body.\n\"Sophia,\" he said urgently. \"Are you-\"\nHer eyes flickered open, but they were unfocused and faraway. \"It's coming,\" she said softly, her voice barely audible.\nTharros moved closer, his expression gloomy. \"What's coming?\"\nSophia fixed her focus on him, and for the first time, her eyes were filled with worry. \"The leviathan. \"It knows.\"\nAs the core's brightness faded, a chill descended over the chamber. The air became heavy and stuffy. Then, from somewhere deep within the city, they heard a low, guttural sound that sent shivers down their spine.\n\"What turned into that?\" Arin inquired, her tone just above a whisper.\nTharros' jaws constricted. \"The Leviathan's caution.\"\nKael strengthened his grip on Sophia, who went limp and breathed shallowly. The gathering lapsed into a tense stillness, the significance of their win obscured by the impending peril.\nOutside, the seas of Aquaria darkened, and the town's bioluminescent glow faded into shade. The Leviathan moved in the depths, unseen but sensed.\nA Beast Awakes\nThe sit-back in the water was unlike anything Aquaria had experienced previously. Sophia awoke to the low, rumbling sound that had pervaded the lab. It was not a dream. It became real, and it was growing closer.\nKael hovered near by, his trident in hand, and the acute discomfort in his shoulders revealed his unease. \"You aren't sleeping,\" he said, softening his voice. However, his gaze kept darting closer to the opening, as if expecting something to break through at any moment.\nSophia forced herself up, her muscles throbbing. Her mind was still fuzzy, with echoes of the Leviathan's presence clawing at the edges of her awareness. \"What's happening?\"\nKael didn't respond right immediately. Instead, he offered a hand to comfort her. \"We have to move. Now.\"\nShe should listen to it in actuality now-the sound of something massive, unrelenting, shifting through the depths. The bioluminescent glow outside the lab began to flicker, generating weird shadows that moved like living things.\nTharros strode into the room, his dragon charisma bursting with restrained power. \"It's begun,\" he announced, his voice harsh and forceful. \"The defenses are protecting for now, however we've were given incoming.\"\nSophia's stomach sunk. \"what number of?\"\nHis jaw stiffened. \"Too many.\"\nThe streets of Aquaria have been a battleground. Corrupted marine monsters infested the metropolis, and their bureaucracy was ugly and inhuman. The formerly beautiful animals, now warped by the Leviathan's influence, surged toward the protecting grid, their bodies throbbing with black energy.\nThe grid remained active for a minute longer, throbbing with the combined power of magic and technology. However, as the bombardment intensified, fractures began to form. The critters had been learning, adapting, and fighting vulnerable conditions with an alarming intelligence.\nSophia and the others arrived at the relevant command hub, where Arin was already in charge of the protection forces. The ocean witch appeared more enraged than concerned, her hands flashing with magic as she issued instructions to the squaddies surrounding her.\n\"Finally,\" Arin exclaimed when she noticed them. \"I concept I'd need to do this alone.\"\nTharros overlooked her tone. \"reputation?\"\n\"Awful,\" Arin replied simply. \"Outer defenses are collapsing. The creatures are doing more than just assaulting; they are also inquiring. They are focusing on the weakest hyperlinks.\nSophia's heart was racing. This was not a random attack. It was organized. deliberate. The Leviathan wasn't trying them out; rather, it was staring at them.\nThe primary breach occurred shortly before Sophia arrived at the management station. A large creature, its body resembling a terrifying hybrid of shark and eel, slammed into the grid with enough force to send shockwaves ripping through the water. The grid flickered and finally died, leaving a gaping hole in the town's defenses.\nSoldiers hurried to stop the breach, their weapons gleaming with magical power. However, the beast became merciless, tearing through them with terrifying efficiency.\nSophia gazed in dread as another wave of corrupted beings rushed through the breach. Panic spread like wildfire throughout the city, and the once-orderly security system collapsed into anarchy.\n\"We can't keep them like this,\" Kael replied, his tone harsh. \"They're too sturdy.\"\nSophia's thoughts raced. The prototype protective device had worked during their tests, but it was not built for an attack like this. They needed more power and control.\n\"Arin,\" Sophia called, her voice cutting through the confusion. \"We have to stabilize the grid. Can you amp up the magic?\"\nArin's eyes shone with purpose. \"I am able to try. However, if something goes wrong...\n\"It won't,\" Sophia remarked, referring to herself rather than anyone else.\nTharros has already begun to move. He charged into the fray, his body transforming into a dragon in midair. The transition evolved into something seamless and terrifyingly gorgeous. His golden scales shimmered in the faint light as he sliced through the enemy ranks with terrible precision.\nThe scene became both awe-inspiring and extremely disturbing. Sophia couldn't help but notice how the corrupted animals seemed to be aware of him and their actions were almost... helpful.\n\"They're attracted to him,\" Kael said, keeping her eyes. \"They know he's the largest threat.\"\nSophia swallowed hard. If the Leviathan's servants were so well-coordinated, what does this imply about the entity in charge?\nArin's magic rushed through the grid, sending pulses of power outward. It labored for a moment. The creatures paused, their movements shaky as the enhanced energy severed their link to the Leviathan.\nHowever, the win was fleeting. The largest of the creatures-a monstrous, massive beast with glittering purple eyes-let forth a bone-chilling roar. The sound echoed through the water, upsetting the precise balance they had just achieved.\nThe beast surged at the grid, its massive body connecting with the power barrier. Sparks flew as the grid strained from the effect, and the light dimmed as the device failed.\nSophia's heart raced as she rushed to adjust the dials. \"We want extra electricity!\"\n\"We don't have extra strength,\" Arin said, her voice tight with frustration.\nSophia's thoughts raced. They longed for a quick, dramatic response. After that, it hit her.\n\"What if we overload the grid?\" she asked, an idea emerging as she spoke. \"Redirect all the power to at least one point, create a feedback loop-\"\n\"That could break the entire machine,\" Kael interrupted. \"It's too unstable.\"\n\"It's already failing,\" Sophia said again. \"If we don't try, we lose the entirety.\"\nTharros' voice boomed through the communications, his dragon shape making his words louder and more forceful. \"Do it.\"\nThe strategy became hazardous, irresponsible, and possibly suicidal. Nonetheless, it was their most effective threat.\nSophia worked furiously on the controls, her palms shaking as she reconfigured the device. Arin stood beside her, her power shining brighter than ever as she directed electricity into the grid.\n\"Now!\" Sophia exclaimed, pushing the final instruction into the machine.\nThe grid erupted in light, a brilliant burst of power that cascaded outward in a massive wave. The corrupted animals froze and convulsed as the energy shattered their link to the Leviathan.\nFor a time, it looked like they had won. The animals began to retreat, their documents disappearing into the shadows.\nBut suddenly, from the depths, came a legitimate that chilled Sophia's blood.\nA roar. Deep, guttural, and filled with fury.\nThe Leviathan's shadow stretched over the city, its presence evident even from afar. The remaining animals gathered, their movements more orderly and functional. They weren't backing out. They've been getting ready.\nSophia glanced at the horizon, her heart sinking as the realization struck her. This was not the end. It was most useful at the beginning.\nKael's words interrupted her thoughts. \"Sophia, what can we do?\"\nShe did not have a solution. Not true, however. But as the Leviathan's roar boomed over the village again, she knew one thing for certain.\nThe battle for Aquaria had only just begun.\nTides of Unity\nThe council room reverberated with anxiety. Elders from all around Aquaria filled the chamber, their shimmering clothes reflecting their affiliations-Shark Clans, Dolphin Pod Seers, Coral Wardens, and more. Their bioluminescent patterns flickered with agitation, and the harsh murmur of whispered discussions resonated like the buzzing of angry bees.\nSophia stood in the center, her palms sticky with sweat. The weight of dozens of gazes fell on her, each pair of eyes assessing her as both rescuer and outsider. Tharros, a towering authority figure, and Arin, whose presence exuded chilly intensity, had stood at her sides. Kael lingered behind them, his silence unusual and his gaze distant.\n\"We have gathered here to discuss Aquaria's survival,\" Tharros began, his voice steady but tinged with inflammation. \"And yet, you bicker like youngsters.\"\nAn elder of the Shark Clans snapped to attention. \"Smooth to mention, King. You sit appropriately behind the palace partitions as the Leviathan unleashes its horrors on our waters!\"\nThe room erupted in pandemonium, with voices clashing and factions hurling accusations. Sophia tightened her hands, her patience fraying.\n\"Enough!\" she exclaimed, the force of her voice cutting through the din. The chamber grew silent, with all eyes drawn to her. \"The Leviathan isn't interested in your rivalries or grudges. It wants to demolish everyone, and if we don't stand together, it will triumph.",

        "content": "The silence that was observed became deafening, and the air was filled with anxiety.\nBecause the assembly persisted, Sophia's words eroded the council's anger. She cited their shared losses, a common opponent, and a need for team spirit. The atmosphere gradually began to alter, with fury giving way to reluctant acquiescence.\nHowever, just as development appeared to be within reach, the leader of the Coral Wardens stood, her eyes burning. \"And why ought to we trust the mer warrior status amongst us?\" She inquired, her voice full of scorn. \"Kael Stormwind conceals an excessive amount of. Who is to say he isn't devoted to the Leviathan?\"\nKael froze, his expression betraying nothing. Sophia, on the other hand, noticed a flicker of discomfort in his eyes. She moved forward, her heart hammering. \"Kael has fought for Aquaria at every turn-\"\n\"because he's hiding his real nature!\" The warden spat. \"Isn't it time to quit disregarding reality? Kael Stormwind is not only a warrior. \"He is a prince.\"\nThe revelation shook the room like a thunderclap. Gasps echoed around the chamber, followed by a flurry of hushed voices.\nSophia turned to Kael, her chest constricting. His visage became a mask of management, but she could see the fury seething beneath it.\n\"Is it authentic?\" she inquired softly.\nKael's eyes fixed on hers, and for a moment, the weight of his secret beyond hovered between them. \"sure,\" he murmured sooner or later, his voice low but steady. \"i'm the remaining heir of the Mer state.\"\nThe council exploded again, this time louder and angrier. Accusations flew around the room, each party disrupting responses, alliances, or retributions. Kael stood motionless, the weight of their rage pressing down on him.\n\"Silence!\" Tharros bellowed, shaking the dividers. The room became quieter, but the fear remained obvious.\nSophia advanced, putting herself between Kael and the council. \"Kael's lineage does not change anything. \"He has repeatedly demonstrated his loyalty.\"\n\"Loyalty?\" The warden scoffed. \"Or method?\" Perhaps the Leviathan wants to retake the Mer kingdom, and Kael is its puppet.\nSophia's temper flared. \"Enough with this paranoia!\" We are fighting for survival, not gambling politics.\"\nThe Shark extended family elder leaned forward, his gaze sharpening. \"What if that's politics? What if Kael's presence here puts us all at risk?\"\nSophia turned to Kael, her voice gentle yet forceful. \"They want to listen it from you.\"\nKael paused, the silence stretching awkwardly. He eventually moved on, his gaze roaming the room. \"I have no nation,\" he continued, his voice normal but filled with deep sadness. \"My humans were lost to the Leviathan a long time ago. I pledged my blade to Aquaria because it is by far the finest home I have left.\"\nThe room became silent as the weight of his words sank in. Sophia recognized for the first time the vulnerability in his eyes-the sorrow of loss, the burden of secrets and tactics.\nArin shattered the silence with her piercing voice. \"Kael has fought alongside us since the beginning.\" If you have any doubts about his allegiance right now, you are blind.\"\nSophia nodded and approached Kael. \"We need him. And we want them to be distinct. The Leviathan feeds on departments. If we fall, we give it the victory.\"\nHours passed as Sophia worked to reestablish the delicate agreement with a few factions. She used logic and passion, science and prophecy, to create a harmonious tapestry of arguments. Slowly and slowly, the groups began to align.\nHowever, just as the meeting was reaching its peak, a powerful tremor shook the hall. The water around them rippled, and the bioluminescent barriers dimmed. A low, frightening hum resonated across the room.\n\"What now?\" Arin mumbled, her power activating intuitively.\nTharros' eyes narrowed, his dragon-like aura of mystery igniting. \"The Leviathan is watching.\"\nThe quake got greater, and the hum turned into a guttural growl that echoed through their bones. Shadows swirled alongside the partitions, making figures that were almost human yet horrifically incorrect.\nSophia's pulse accelerated as one of the shadows moved forward, forming into a figure shrouded in darkness. Its voice became like the grinding of stone on stone, bloodless and harsh.\n\"You waste your time,\" it said, its dazzling eyes fixed on Sophia. \"No alliance can save you. \"The Leviathan is eternal.\nSophia's terror threatened to strangle her, but she held her ground. \"eternal or no longer, we'll combat.\"\nThe shadow chuckled, which sent shivers down her spine. \"Fools. \"The Leviathan is already inside your walls.\"\nBefore everyone could react, the shadow vanished, leaving only the echo of its laughter.\nThe council was thrown into disarray, with concern sweeping through the groups like a tidal wave. Sophia came to Tharros, her mind racing. \"What did it imply?\" \"Interior our walls?\"\nArin's expression clouded. \"This suggests the Leviathan has spies. Traitors.\"\nKael's grasp on the trident intensified. \"We aim to relax the city. Now.\"\nSophia nodded, but her mind had been somewhere else. The Leviathan's remarks had served as both a threat and a challenge. And he or she had no intention of backing down.\nAs the factions dispersed to prepare for the next onslaught, Sophia stood in the heart of the chamber, her determination hardening. The Leviathan sought to split them, to portray them as opposed to all else. But she would not let it win\n.\nShe mumbled \"collectively,\" more to herself than anyone else. \"We'll face it together.\"\nEchoes of Dread\nThe dark seas around Aquaria's city churned with invisible motion, and shadows flickered like strained specters. Sophia stood on the palace balcony, her thoughts clouded by the Leviathan's caution. The Leviathan is already inside your walls.\nHer thoughts repeated the lines over and over. Something became incorrect. The quiet of the town underneath did not feel like tranquility; it felt rather like the acute silence before a storm.\nArin's voice pierced through the silence behind her. \"It is spreading. fear.\"\nSophia became. Arin stood in the doorway, her gaze enigmatic, and her black power simmered softly at her fingertips.\n\"What do you suggest?\" Sophia asked, dread seeping into her chest.\nArin approached, her golden eyes gleaming. \"They whisper. The paranoia. It's no longer herbal. The Leviathan's messengers are here, causing havoc beneath our feet.\"\nSophia's throat clenched. \"How do we discover them?\"\nArin's lips formed a frigid smile. \"We haven't located them. \"They will come to us.\"\nThe metropolis felt heavier as Sophia and Arin walked through the bioluminescent streets. Kael and Tharros flanked them, their rifles fully prepared. The people muttered as they handed, their gleaming styles fading with anxiety.\n\"They're scared,\" Kael said quietly.\n\"They should be,\" Tharros mumbled.\nSophia maintained her eyes on the streets, looking for something unexpected. Her nerves tingled with anxiety, and her link to the Leviathan pulsated slightly at the edges of her thoughts.\nThen, out of the corner of her eye, she observed a figure wrapped in darkness disappearing into an alleyway.\n\"There,\" she said, her voice harsh.\nThe institution followed, the narrow tunnel enveloping them in shadow. The discern moved swiftly, but not soon enough. Kael pushed forward, his trident twirling, cutting off their escape.\nThe figure paused and turned to face them. Its face became obscured, but its voice sounded like a hiss between gritted teeth. \"You shouldn't have observed.\"\nTharros improved, his dragon's aura of secrecy crackling. \"Who sent you?\"\nThe discern produced a terrifying chuckle that made Sophia's pores and skin crawl. \"you know the solution.\"\nThe air grew colder and thicker. Sophia felt the Leviathan's presence intensify, its impact drawing closer.\nArin's magic ignited, and her voice cut through the anxiety. \"You are one of each of them. \"A servant of the forbidden sect.\"\nThe discern turned its head, its motions eerily smooth. \"Remember us, witch. I perceive that the darkness in you continues.\"\nArin's expression tightened as her power burned brighter. \"no longer anymore.\"\nThe discern laughed, and the sound echoed oddly. Then it moved-too quickly, too smoothly. Tharros rushed, but the figure faded into shadow, gliding past him like water.\nThe organization regrouped inside the palace's war room, apprehension thick in the air. Arin paced, clenching her hands.\n\"They're no longer just emissaries,\" she said, her tone sharp. \"They are members of the Abyssal Order. A sect that has served the Leviathan for many years.\nSophia frowned. \"I idea they had been wiped out.\"\n\"They had been,\" Arin remarked bitterly. \"Or so we thought. However, it appears the Leviathan saved a few loyalists.\nKael's jaw tightened as he leaned against the wall. \"How can we combat them?\"\nArin's gaze darkened as she stopped pacing. \"We don't; not yet. They thrive on fear. We need to stop their influence before it spreads.\"\nSophia's heart quickened. \"And if we can't?\"\nArin's quiet transformed into answer sufficient.\nThat night time, Sophia couldn't sleep. The Leviathan's words had grown louder now, its voice winding round her thoughts like fog.\nyou may't store them.",

        "content": "Sophia sat up abruptly, her heart thumping. The room turned dark, although she wasn't alone.\nA shadow shifted within the corner, its form moving oddly.\n\"who are you?\" Sophia ordered, her voice constant in spite of the concern tugging at her chest.\nThe determine walked into the little light, its face still hidden. \"you know.\"\nSophia clinched her fists. \"You're one in all them.\"\nThe parent willing its head. \"And so are you.\"\nThe phrases sent a kick back down her spine. \"I'm nothing such as you.\"\nThe determined laughed quietly. \"Do you hear it?\" The Leviathan's call. You may feel its might growing within you. You, like us, are a part of it.\"\nSophia's chest clenched as the Leviathan's presence pressed against her thoughts. \"You're wrong.\"\n\"Am I?\" The person spoke while tilting its head. \"You believe you can combat it. However, the more you tolerate, the stronger it becomes. Why fight when you can join us?\nSophia's solution toughened. \"I'll in no way be a part of you.\"\nThe discern's laughing vanished, replaced by a low, ominous tone. \"We'll see.\"\nThen, as soon as it had appeared, the figure faded into shadow, leaving Sophia alone in the oppressive blackness.\nThe following morning, Sophia gathered the others in the war room. Her tiredness became evident, as did her dedication.\n\"They want to divide us,\" she replied, her voice unwavering. \"To make us activate each other.\" \"We can't let them.\"\nArin nodded, her magic wavering slightly. \"We want to find their base of operations. \"Cut off the snake's pinnacle.\"\nKael frowned. \"and how can we do this?\"\nSophia hesitated, the Leviathan's murmurs tugging at her mind. \"I think i'm able to song them.\"\nTharros' gaze narrowed. \"How?\"\nSophia returned his look, her voice lower. \"The relationship.\" The Leviathan's presence is more intense now. If I recognize it, I'll probably be able to see it lower back to them.\"\nThe room fell silent, and the results hung heavily in the air.\n\"That's risky,\" Kael said later, his voice stressed. \"What if it overwhelms you?\"\nSophia swallowed hard. \"We don't have some other choice.\"\nThey followed Sophia's example and ventured into the darker outskirts of the metropolis. The water here had been cooler and murkier, with light from the bioluminescent coral barely reaching the depths.\nSophia's link to the Leviathan became stronger with each stride, the whispers becoming louder and more persistent. Her head ached, her eyesight blurred, yet she persisted.\n\"There,\" she said, pointing to a dilapidated temple covered in shadow. \"They're inner.\"\nThe group approached carefully, weapons drawn. The air became heavy with enchantment, and the shadows writhed like living beings.\nAs they entered the temple, the voices became loud. Figures came from the darkness, their shapes fluid and unsettling.\nThe fight grew sudden and chaotic. Tharros morphed into a dragon, cutting through the shadows with fierce precision. Kael fought with deliberate movements, his trident sparkling in the dark lighting. Arin's magic flared brightly, cutting through the darkness like a beacon.\nBut Sophia became their aim. The messengers swarmed her, their voices hissing together. \"You cannot combat it. \"You belong to us.\"\nSophia's chest burned, as the Leviathan's presence surged within her. She collapsed to her knees, gripping her head as the murmurs became increasingly loud and overwhelming.\nAllow pass.\n\"Sophia!\" Kael's voice became quieter as a result of the cacophony, which grounded her.\nSophia gritted her enamel and forced herself to stand. The Leviathan's force flowed through her, but she didn't let it consume her. Alternatively, she turned it against the emissaries, producing a powerful wave that scattered them.\nThe chamber fell silent, and the shadows retreated into the depths.\nSophia staggered, her energy diminishing, but Kael stopped her before she fell.\n\"It's no\nlonger over,\" she said, her voice shaking.\nTharros advanced with his lower back in human shape and a terrible face. \"No. \"It is only the beginning.\"\nHeart of the Abyss\nThe darkness clung to Sophia like a second skin, stifling and frigid. She sat in the conflict room, staring at the maps sprawled across the desk, her mind racing. The Leviathan's murmurs had not stopped because of the temple. They strained on her resolve, each syllable sinking further into her mind.\n\"You're slipping,\" Arin's piercing voice interrupted the silence, frightening her.\nSophia looked up to see the sea witch leaning against the doorframe, hands crossed, with an enigmatic face.\nSophia responded, \"I'm great,\" but her voice was barely credible.\nArin came closer, her golden eyes narrowing. \"You are lying. Whatever connection you have to that issue is expanding, and it is pulling you apart.\"\nSophia clinched her fist. \"If i can use it-\"\n\"-You'll destroy yourself,\" Arin said, her tone sharp but not harsh. \"I walked that line before you, Sophia. I've felt the tug. You assume you have studied and are in control until the darkness consumes everything.\"\nSophia turned aside, her chest constricting. \"I don't have a preference.\"\nArin's visage softened, but her voice remained hard. You usually have an option. Simply make sure it's the correct one.\"\nThe following morning, the plan started to take shape. Sophia gathered Kael, Tharros, and Arin in the royal room. The water around them pulsed gently with Aquaria's power, but even its soothing light couldn't hide the worry in the room.\n\"I want to go deeper,\" Sophia began, pushing her voice to remain consistent. \"I want to trace the Leviathan's effect back to its source. If I can learn where its coronary heart is-\"\n\"We are capable of ruining it,\" Tharros concluded, his tone as cold as metal.\nKael frowned, striking his trident softly against the earth. \"And if you may not? What happens if the Leviathan takes control of you?\nSophia said, \"It won't,\" with skepticism in her eyes.\nKael moved closer, his presence providing grounding pressure. \"You do not recognize that. This component is already present within your mind, warping you. What if it drags you too far?\nArin, who has status in the aspect, spoke up. \"She's correct about one aspect-we don't have time to waste. However, she is no longer doing this alone.\n\"I don't want any of you-\" Sophia began.\n\"Too awful,\" Arin cut her off, her voice stern. \"You're now not the best one combating for this town.\"\nTharros, who had been silent until now, advanced, his golden eyes fixed on Sophia. \"If that is the handiest way, then we'll see it through. together.\"\nSophia nodded, the weight of their decision sitting heavily on her shoulders.\nThey descended into the royal crypt beneath the palace, which few had ever visited. The chamber became historical, carved from coral and stone, its walls etched with runes that gleamed dimly in the low light.\n\"This area feels wrong,\" Kael murmured, his voice low.\nArin's palms touched one of the bright runes as she improved. \"The crypt is a gateway, a location where nation-state borders are thin. If Sophia connects with the Leviathan, it will happen right here.\nSophia advanced to the center of the chamber, her heart quickening. The Leviathan's murmurs were stronger with each stride, a cold caress on her psyche.\n\"Are you sure about this?\" Tharros asked, his voice firm but filled with apprehension.\n\"No,\" Sophia admits. \"but I have to attempt.\"\nShe knelt before the cool stone, her breathing steadying as she closed her eyes. The voices erupted, a chorus of wrath and energy that threatened to consume her.\nYou may not break me out.\nSophia gritted her teeth, determined to push through the Leviathan's crushing presence. \"Display me,\" she said softly, scarcely audible. \"show me where you are.\"\nThe visions arrived in fragments, disorganized and overwhelming. A trench, darker and deeper than Sophia had ever seen. Tendrils of dark electricity writhed like living things, coiling around a pulsating, dazzling core.\nA heartbeat. Deep, rich, and frighteningly alive.\nSophia gasped as the inventive and clairvoyant fed on her, drawing her into the Leviathan's world. She felt herself slipping, plunging into the depths, the murmurs becoming louder and more powerful.\nBe a part of me.\nHer breathing increased, and her body trembled as the Leviathan crushed against her thoughts, drowning them.\n\"Sophia!\" Kael's voice broke through the blur, piercing and urgent.\nSophia snapped back to reality, her chest heaving as she opened her eyes. The room whirled, but Kael's steady fingers kept her grounded.\n\"I saw it,\" she explained, her voice quivering. \"The trench.\" That's where the coronary heart is.\"\nTharros advanced with a gloomy face. \"Then that's where we'll pass.\"\nSophia shook her head, the memory of the inventive and perceptive sending shivers down her spine. \"Now it's not so straightforward. The coronary heart is alive. It's part of the Leviathan. And it is aware that we are approaching.\"",

        "content": "Lower back in the struggle room, the institution studied maps and charts with a laser-like focus. Sophia traced a luminous line on the map, indicating the route of the trench.\n\"We'll need each soldier, each aid,\" Tharros said, his voice authoritative. \"If we smash the coronary heart, we are able to cripple the Leviathan.\"\n\"But if we fail,\" Kael warned grimly, \"it will retaliate with everything it has.\"\nArin leaned closer the table, her attention fixed on Sophia. \"There's more, isn't there?\"\nSophia hesitated, the Leviathan's whispers scratching at the edges of her consciousness. \"The connection is stronger now.\" The closer we go to the coronary heart, the more it will suck me in.\"\nKael's jaws constricted. \"And what takes place if it pulls too difficult?\"\nSophia met his eyes, keeping her voice calm. \"Then I'll combat it.\"\nThat night, the voices became terrible. Sophia paced her quarters, her arms trembling as the Leviathan's voice resounded in her memory.\nYou cannot stop me. You are mine.\n\"Get out of my head,\" she yelled, bringing her palms to her temples.\nThe voice laughed, a deep and terrifying sound that sent shivers down her spine. You are already mine. You just don't know it.\nSophia squeezed her fists, her rage escalating. \"I'll show you incorrect.\"\nThe laughing subsided, replaced by a deafening silence.\nAt morning, they stood on the edge of the abyss. The ditch appeared front of them, its darkness engulfing the pale bioluminescent brightness of the waters above.\nSophia peered into the void, her heart hammering as the Leviathan's presence intensified. Its voices have become deafening, a constant, unyielding worry in her head.\nCome to me.\nKael stood next to her, his countenance gloomy. \"Are you equipped?\"\n\"No,\" Sophia admits. \"however I don't assume I ever can be.\"\nTharros transformed into a dragon, his golden scales glittering in the low light. \"Live near,\" he said, his voice low and rumbling.\nArin's magic sparked at her fingertips as she moved forward. \"anything happens down there, we face it collectively.\"\nSophia nodded, her determination strengthened. The Leviathan's heart lurked below, a throbbing source of power that could either store or destroy Aquaria.\nAs they fell into the ditch, the darkness closed in around them, and the murmurs became louder with each passing second.\nThen, from the depths, came the sound of the heartbeat. Deep, rich, and frighteningly alive.\nThe Storm’s Warning\nThe waters around Aquaria rippled with an unearthly energy. The bioluminescent glow that had previously illuminated the metropolis faded, giving way to an unsettling darkness that appeared to ooze from the trench. Sophia stood on the edge of the balcony, peering into the vast expanse of deep blue as the first rumbles of the storm rang through the currents.\nIt wasn't an ordinary hurricane. She could feel it. This was something created by the Leviathan's will, a representation of its fury and might. The murmurs that had troubled her head had become louder, sharper, and more dominating.\nBehind her, the room came alive with movement. Kael and Tharros had been preparing the metropolis' defenses as Arin browsed through ancient books, her magic crackling slightly around her fingertips.\n\"It's coming,\" Sophia whispered, her voice barely audible.\nTharros grew up, his golden eyes narrowing. \"We need to act quickly. If the defense fails-\"\n\"They won't fail,\" Kael interrupted, his voice still tinted with dread. \"We received't allow them to.\"\nSophia grasped the handrail, her thoughts swirling like the turbulent waves below. The typhoon was not only a warning. It became a promise.\nThe primary strike arrived without warning. A shockwave ripped through the city, shaking the coral homes and spewing dazzling debris into the lake. The currents grew wild, pulling everything in their path.\nSophia tripped, catching herself against the wall as the palace rattled. \"What become that?\"\n\"The hurricane,\" Kael said solemnly, clutching his trident tightly. \"It's beginning.\"\nArin's words faded amid the tumult. \"It is no longer merely a typhoon. \"Something is amplifying it.\"\nTharros snarled, his dragon persona flashing. \"The Leviathan is testing us. We maintain the road.\"\nThe palace guards hurried to reinforce the outer walls as the currents grew stronger. Outside, the previously calm seas had turned into a churning storm. Corrupted sea creatures surged with the storm, their perverted bureaucracies darting through the tumult and focusing on the city's fortifications.\n\"cross!\" Tharros barked, bringing Kael and the guards running into the fray.\nSophia moved to obey, but Arin grabbed her arm. \"You're staying right here.\"\n\"i'm able to help-\"\n\"You will help by surviving,\" Arin snarled, her voice bloodless but protective. \"This hurricane isn't only about power. There is something buried here, and we must find it.\nSophia and Arin proceeded deeper into the palace, the halls strangely silent despite the chaos outside. Sophia's thoughts were filled with the Leviathan's words, which guided her and drew her closer to something unknown.\nSophia blurted out, \"There's a chamber,\" before she could stop herself.\nArin frowned. \"What chamber?\"\n\"I don't understand,\" Sophia admitted, her voice trembling. \"But it is here. I will sense it.\"\nArin did not question her. She nodded, her magic blazing as she summoned a glowing orb of light to guide their way.\nThe air grew colder as they descended, and the partitions narrowed and twisted in unexpected ways. The palace had previously been a maze of hidden corridors, but this was exclusive. This course felt alive, with the runes on the partitions pulsing faintly as they passed.\n\"This was not built by Aquarians,\" Arin murmured, her gaze scanning the glowing inscriptions. \"this is historical magic.\"\nSophia's chest tightened as the whispers became more intense, with each word clawing at her throat. \"It's connected to the Leviathan. I'm certain of it.\nThey reached the end of the hall, where a massive door was etched with glowing runes. The symbols twisted and shifted as if alive, their movements mesmerizing and unsettling.\nArin moved forward, her hands brushing the floor of the door. Her energy surged, slamming with the runes in a blast of warmth.\n\"It's a seal,\" Arin remarked, her voice unpleasant. \"whatever's in the back of this door turned into meant to stay hidden.\"\nSophia hesitated, the Leviathan's presence urgent towards her thoughts like a bodily weight. \"We want to open it.\"\nArin shot her a crisp appearance. \"You don't even recognise what's in there.\"\n\"I don't care,\" Sophia murmured, her voice difficult. \"If it's connected to the Leviathan, we want to recognize.\"\nArin didn't argue. She located her hands against the door, her power pouring into the runes. The symbols flashed brighter, their movements rising faster till, with a thunderous crack, the door begun to open.\nThe chamber past gotten larger, its partitions covered with more dazzling runes that pulsed like a heartbeat. at the middle of the chamber stood a pedestal, and above it rested an orb of swirling mild and shadow.\nSophia walked nearer, interested in the orb despite the danger bells blaring in her mind. The voices in her head were deafening, and the Leviathan's voice sounded louder than before.\nThis is your future.\nArin grabbed her arm and pulled her lower back. \"Don't contact it.\"\nSophia blinked, breaking out of her stupor. \"what's it?\"\nArin examined the orb, her expression gloomy. \"A key. Or a weapon. Maybe both. The runes suggest it's linked to the Leviathan, however...\n\"however what?\"\nArin hesitated, her fingertips tracing one of the nearby runes. \"There is a prophecy. It states that the person wielding this energy has the ability to destroy or become the Leviathan.\nSophia's blood became chilly. \"damage it or emerge as it?\"\nArin nodded. \"the choice is yours.\"\nBefore they could process the revelation, the chamber trembled. The storm outside had reached its peak, and the currents were so strong that they shook even the palace's innermost components.\n\"We want to go,\" Arin said, her magic burning protectively around them.\nSophia's eyes remained on the ball, constricting her chest. She could sense its force and pull.\n\"I can use it,\" she replied gently.\n\"No,\" Arin said, her tone stern. \"Now, not yet.\" We don't comprehend enough about it. \"If you take that energy now, it may spoil you.\"\nSophia hesitated, the whispers pulling her on. But Arin's hold on her arm pulled her back to reality.\n\"Now, not yet,\" Arin said firmly.\nSophia nodded grudgingly and stepped away from the pedestal.\nThey returned to the conflict room, where Tharros and Kael had already been prepared. Both were beaten but alive, with sad looks.\n\"The defenses held,\" Tharros said, his voice low. \"but barely.\"\nKael's gaze shifted to Sophia, his dread evident. \"What did you discover?\"\nSophia hesitated, glanced at Arin before responding. \"A weapon.\" Or a key. Something related to the Leviathan.\"\nTharros frowned. \"and you didn't deliver it?\"\n\"It's too risky,\" Arin said firmly. \"If she uses it without information it, she should make matters worse.\"\nSophia did not argue. She may want to feel the orb's pull, its power calling to her. However, Arin shifted to the right. For now.\nAs the organization deliberated their next measures, the typhoon began to decrease. However, the damage has been completed. The city was rattled, and the people were terrified.\nSophia stood on the balcony again, peering out at the dark lake. The Leviathan's whispers had become quieter, but they hadn't stopped.\nYou are unable to escape me.\nShe clinched her hands, her remedy solidifying. The storm became just the beginning. The Leviathan became stronger, and time ran out.\nHowever, they now possessed a weapon. A choice. Sophia became determined to make it memorable.\nShattered Currents\nThe shock of the storm's aftermath persisted even after Aquaria's currents began to moderate. The bioluminescent coral partitions of the city pulsed softly, like the faltering heartbeat of a nation left on its own. Kael stood on the western watchtower, eyeing the horizon as the seas swirled abnormally. His jaw tightened, the weight of the recent confrontation pressing on his shoulders. Below, remains of deformed marine creatures-the Leviathan's pawns-floated, their warped bureaucracy a somber reminder of their adversary's reach.\nSophia's voice drew him from his thoughts. \"Kael.\" She approached cautiously, her expression light yet resolute. Despite her exhaustion, her presence was a beacon of strength.\nHe turned and forced a vulnerable smile. \"Sophia. You should rest. \"That warfare took its toll on anyone.\"\nShe shook her head and stepped closer. \"Relaxation is not an option right now. \"No longer after what we saw.\" Her voice faltered slightly, revealing the weight of what she was carrying.\nKael's eyes clouded. \"The orb.\"\nShe nodded. \"This is a weapon, Kael. However, it is also a risk we are not willing to take. I need to recognize it more before...\" Her voice fell off, and a shiver ran through her. The Leviathan's whispers lingered in her mind, alluring and disturbing.\nKael reached out, brushing his hand on her arm. \"You don't have to deal with this alone. Whatever happens, I will be there. \"We all will.\"\nSophia looked into his eyes, finding peace in his unwavering remedy. But there wasn't time to remain. A loud horn blared from the outer borders, a deep, resonant sound that chilled them all.\n\"An ambush,\" Kael said, his tone harsh.\nSophia's heart fell. \"We're going for walks out of time.\"",

        "content": "Aquaria's outside lands provided a stark contrast to the lively city. The sea became chillier and darker, as if the Leviathan's presence had crept into every present day. Kael led the charge, his trident blazing in the dark light. Behind him, a group of warriors followed, their faces bleak but resolute.\nSophia and Arin watched the organization, the ocean witch's magic crackling slightly about her. Sophia's fingertips itched with anxiety as the Leviathan's whispers became louder the closer they got.\nThe attack arrived quickly. Shadows burst from the pits, and twisted sea creatures swarmed in coordinated waves. Kael yelled directions, his voice cutting through the confusion. \"Preserve the road!\" \"Protect the healers!\"\nSophia tried to concentrate, her hydrokinesis weakening under the strain. Arin's magic ignited, creating protective restrictions that shone like glass. \"They're looking into us,\" Arin said, her tone harsh. \"This is not a complete attack. They're looking for flaws.\"\nSophia tightened her fists, rage seething inside of her. \"And we're giving them exactly what they want.\"\nKael's voice broke through. \"Awareness, Sophia.\" We won't spend money on distractions.\"\nHowever, even as he spoke, the road began to falter. A gigantic creature-a merger of corrupted shark and eel-broke through, its jaws snapping perilously close to the front line. Kael raced forward, his trident a blur as he thrust it into the beast's maw. The beast writhed, its death struggles dispersing nearby troops.\nSophia's chest clenched as she witnessed Kael struggle. Every flow became deliberate and specific, but she could see the stress in his movements. They had been losing ground.\nThe argument raged for what seemed like hours. By the time the remaining beast collapsed, the seas were heavy with fight debris. Sophia's limbs felt heavy, and her power was drained. Kael stood among the wreckage, his armor tattered but his stare blazing.\n\"We need to regroup,\" he said, his voice steady but laced with tiredness. \"This has become a distraction. \"The actual assault is approaching.\"\nSophia approached him, heartbroken at the sight of his injuries. \"Kael...\"\nHe dismissed her difficulties. \"I am first-class. \"We need to be aware of what comes next.\"\nBefore she could argue, a fresh figure appeared from the shadows. A parent in dark scales, moving fluidly and deliberately. The soldiers readied their weapons, but Kael held up a hand, his gaze hardening.\n\"Wait.\"\nThe parent moved closer, exposing a face adorned with intricate marks. \"I am available in peace,\" they declared, their voice rich and resonant. \"I deliver facts that might turn the tide.\"\nSophia improved gradually. \"who're you?\"\nThe determine tilted their head. \"Kyras from the Shark Clans. \"A best friend, if you'll have me.\"\nKael's expression hardened. \"The Shark Clans were never allies. \"Why now?\"\nKyras' stare met him unwaveringly. \"Because the Leviathan threatens everyone. It wants to isolate Aquaria and weaken you before striking. But its arrogance may be its doom.\"\nSophia's pulse quickened. \"What do you imply?\"\nKyras hesitated, his gaze flickering to the battlefield. \"There is a hidden passage, a weak point in the Leviathan's defenses. However, if you intend to take advantage of it, you must act quickly. \"The longer you wait, the stronger it becomes.\"\nKael's jaws constricted. \"And why need to we trust you?\"\nKyras extended his arms, his expression unreadable. \"Because if you don't, Aquaria will collapse. \"And so will my humans.\"\nThe anxiety was palpable in the lower back of the palace. Tharros walked around the battle room, his golden eyes blazing. \"You introduced a Shark extended family warrior into our city?\"\nKael stood on the floor, his voice steady. \"He's giving us a chance to strike lower back. \"We can't afford to ignore it.\"\nTharros muttered deep in his throat, but Sophia advanced before he could dispute any further. \"He's right. If Kyras is speaking the truth, this might be the prospect we've been anticipating. however we need to act now.\"\nTharros's stare softened barely as it rested on her, yet his tone stayed company. \"And if it's a lure?\"\n\"Then we cope with it,\" Arin interjected, her voice frigid although adamant. \"We're jogging out of alternatives, Tharros. The Leviathan's already interior Sophia's thoughts. we can't watch for it to strike first.\"\nTharros's fists tensed, nevertheless he agreed unwillingly. \"first-class. however I'm main the challenge.\"\nKael's eyes flared with hostility, but Sophia moved among them, her voice quiet however commanding. \"We try this collectively. anybody.\"\nThe plan transformed into set. They would infiltrate the Leviathan's outer defenses via the hidden route under Kyras' guidance. It became volatile, but it became a delightful shot. Sophia felt a shiver down her spine as the party prepared to leave. The Leviathan's murmurs had been faint but insistent.\nYou may not stop me. You certainly couldn't.\nShe shrugged off the voice and concentrated on the journey ahead. However, as they went deeper, the Leviathan's presence became increasingly oppressive, threatening to destroy her resolve.\nKael swam beside her, brushing his hand across hers momentarily. It became a little gesture, but it grounded her, reminding her of the power they shared.\nAs they approached the entrance to the passage, Kyras paused, his look somber. \"After this point, there is no turning lower back.\" \"Are you ready?\"\nSophia examined her partners-Kael, Tharros, and Arin. Everyone carried his own loads and personal worries. They were more powerful united, though.\n\"We're ready,\" she said, her voice steady.\nKyras nodded and led the way, but the darkness swallowed them up completely. The path was tiny and perilous, the walls covered in antique runes that appeared to pulse with terrible force.\nSophia's heart raced as the voices became louder, more urgent. After that, just as they approached the end of the passage, a loud noise broke the calm.\nThe Leviathan's presence surged, and its voice echoed across the currents.\nWelcome to my section.\nSophia's breath hitched as the darkness ahead\ncame alive, casting a massive shadow towards them. The conflict was not over. It became a simple start.\nThe Leviathan’s Eyes\nThe blackness seemed to pulsate about them, like a living, breathing organism, making every shadow a hazard. Sophia's pulse hammered as the huge shape of the Leviathan approached, its presence an uncomfortable weight pressing against her chest. Kael tightened his grasp on his trident, his gaze drawn to Kyras for any signs of treason. Tharros' dragon aura sparked brightly under the water, while Arin's magic shimmered at her fingertips, ready to strike.\nBut the Leviathan did not attack. Instead, it watched, its historical and knowledgeable gaze cutting through the currents. Sophia's mental whispers became louder and more persistent, as if the monster was speaking to her immediately.\nYou cannot stop what is coming.\nSophia's vision dimmed, and a wave of nausea swept over her. She staggered, grasping Kael's arm for support. His hand steadied her, and his voice was piercing. \"Sophia, stay with me.\"\nKyras' voice grew quieter as he became anxious. \"It's testing us out. Do not react.\nTharros hissed lowly, his golden eyes flashing. \"If it's a fight it wishes, I'll provide it one.\"\n\"No!\" Sophia's voice sounded strained yet forceful. She straightened, meeting the Leviathan's gaze despite the anxiety gnawing at her insides. \"That is what it desires. It's attempting to provoke us.\nThe Leviathan's bloodless, mocking laughter resonated in her head. Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the huge shadow vanished into the depths. The currents grew, but the tension remained.\nArin inhaled softly, her magic faded. \"What become that?\"\nSophia's voice became silent. \"Be cautious. \"And a venture.\"\nSophia walked the battle chamber in the palace's lowest level, her thoughts a jumble. The encounter had left her rattled, but it had also given her insight. The Leviathan was not merely a mindless force of destruction. It moved into calculating and planning. And it had a plan.\n\"The corrupted creatures,\" she said at immediately, breaking the silence. \"They are more than just squaddies. \"They are scouts.\"\nKael frowned and leaned on the desk. \"Scouts?\"\nSophia nodded as her thoughts raced. \"Consider it.\" They are continually one step ahead of us, probing our defenses. They no longer act on impulse. \"They are being managed.\"\nTharros crossed his hands, his face suspicious. \"and how precisely are they being managed?\"\nSophia hesitated, piecing together the shards of information in her mind. \"Through their eyes.\" The glittering styles, the way they flow-it's as if they're all linked to something. \"Or a person.\"\nArin's eyes narrowed. \"The Leviathan.\"\nSophia nodded. \"It is utilizing them to observe us and investigate our flaws. If we can sever that link immediately, we will most likely be able to buy ourselves some time.\nKyras' voice softened but remained company. \"and how do you propose we do this?\"\nSophia's gaze tightened. \"We combat science with magic.\"\nSophia's lab, which she had set up in the palace's upper levels, was a typical blend of history and magic. Crystalline formations pulsed with magical energy in sync with the hum of human devices. She worked feverishly, reading the dazzling patterns she'd discovered on the corrupted creatures. Arin stood behind her, her magic enhancing the facts as they sought a solution.\n\"If we destroy the sign,\" Sophia exclaimed, her voice tinted with excitement, \"it will disorient them. \"Like slicing a puppet's strings.\"\nArin scowled, her mistrust clear. \"Disorienting them is a component. But what about ending the relationship completely? That is a special undertaking.\"\n\"We don't want to sever it permanently,\" Sophia replied. \"just long enough to show the tide in our want.\"\nKael entered the lab, his presence a calming influence. \"How lengthy?\"\nSophia looked at him, her tiredness evident. \"Some hours, if we're lucky. But I need more time to check the notion.\"\n\"We don't have time,\" Tharros replied, entering the room. His golden gaze hooked on Sophia. \"The Leviathan isn't going to watch for us to determine this out.\"\n\"Then we make time,\" Sophia stated firmly. \"that is our first-rate danger to level the playing discipline.\"\nThe subsequent onslaught arrived earlier than expected. The warning sounded out across the city, accompanied by a haunting song that sent chills down the spines of every Aquarian. Sophia and her partners dashed to the outer fortifications, the seas rife with mayhem.\nTwisted creatures swarmed, their luminous eyes a constant reminder of the Leviathan's vastness. Sophia's improvised contraption, a combination of magic and science, became tied to her wrist. It pulsed softly, ready to be triggered.\n\"Are you sure this can paintings?\" Kael inquired, his voice low and calm.\nSophia returned his look, determination shining in her eyes. \"No. but we don't have a preference.\"\nTharros' dragon air of stealth erupted as he seized his sector on the front lines. \"Then permit's supply them hell.\"\nThe war became a whirl of movement and noise. Sophia stayed near Arin, with the sea witch's magic establishing a protective barrier around them. As the aliens approached, Sophia triggered the tool.\nA shockwave swept over the water, unseen yet effective. The creatures' movements slowed, and their luminous eyes faded as the connection to the Leviathan weakened. For a brief while, the battlefield became strangely silent.\n\"It's running,\" Arin announced, her voice filled with astonishment.\nHowever, the reprieve proved to be temporary. Sophia felt the Leviathan's presence and heard its speech as a roar.\nYou realize you can defy me?\nSophia's legs buckled as the murmurs turned into a scream, but she forced herself to remain standing. \"We want to keep the road!\" she said, her voice cutting through the commotion.\nKael and Tharros fought with increased zeal, their movements a deadly tango. Kyras demonstrated his dedication with targeted and uncompromising moves. Aquaria's warriors banded together to stem the flow of corruption.\nHowever, the Leviathan was not completed. The waves darkened as its shadow loomed again. Sophia's technology began to weaken, the glow fading as the pressure became too intense.\n\"It's overloading!\" Arin shouted.\n\"We're out of time,\" Kael replied, his tone bleak.\nSophia's thoughts raced. They couldn't hold out much longer. The Leviathan's effect became too powerful. Then an idea struck her: daring and risky, but their best hazard.\n\"I'm going to increase the signal,\" she said, using her fingers to adjust the device.\n\"That might kill you,\" Tharros warned, his voice stern.\n\"If I don't, we'll all die,\" Sophia said, her tone leaving no room for debate.\nBefore any of us could stop her, she reactivated the gadget, pouring her own electricity into it. The accompanying shockwave turned into a brilliant explosion of light, sending the monsters reeling. The connection to the Leviathan broke, and for the first time, the battlefield was silent.\nSophia fainted, her eyesight blurring as tiredness overwhelmed her. The last thing she heard was Kael's desperate voice.\n\"Sophia, stay with me!\"\nWhen Sophia woke up, the ocean was calm. The conflict was over, but the Leviathan's shadow remained in her mind. She looked around and saw Kael, Tharros, Arin, and Kyras near her. Their features were marked with worry and yearning.\n\"We sold ourselves time,\" Kael replied softly. \"but it's no longer over.\"",

        "content": "Sophia nodded hesitantly, her clear complexion hardening. The Leviathan had exposed its hand, but they hadn't finished fighting. But not any longer.\nAnd as she peered into the distance, where the seas darkened and the murmurs persisted, she realized the true battle was still ahead.\nFires of Betrayal\nThe palace became eerily quiet. Aquaria had fallen into silence since the final battle, yet worry boiled beneath the floor, ready to boil over. Sophia sat in the war room, her thoughts repeating the battle over and over. The Leviathan's murmurs lingered like ghosts, making her mistrust each move and syllable. She looked around the desk where Tharros sat, his golden eyes filled with anxiety.\nKael entered, his armor still scuffed from the fight. \"Patrols have returned. The outer trenches show no signs of movement.\"\n\"It's too quiet,\" Tharros said, his voice low. \"The Leviathan is not retreating. It is plotting something.\"\nSophia nodded. \"And we're not prepared for it.\" Her gaze shifted to Arin, who stood by the window, peering into the black waters beyond.\nBefore anyone could answer, the doors sprang open. Kyras strode in, his face grim. \"we've a trouble.\"\nThe council room became filled with anxiety. Aquaria's leaders, once strong in their unity, now exchanged anxious glances. Kyras stood in the center, commanding attention despite the council members' apprehensive gaze.\n\"The Leviathan's have an impact on runs deeper than we thought,\" started Kyras. \"There's a traitor amongst you.\"\nThe crowd erupted in murmurs, and incredulity spread like wildfire. Tharros climbed to his feet, his mysterious demeanor tinged with slightly suppressed rage. \"That's an extreme accusation, Kyras.\"\n\"And it's authentic,\" Kyras said, shooting lower back. \"One of your personnel has been passing information to the Leviathan's emissaries. That's how they've remained one step ahead.\nSophia's stomach twisted. She examined the faces in the room, looking for any signs of guilt. \"Do you have proof?\" she asked, her voice steady despite the tumult within her.\nKyras hesitated and then nodded. \"enough to recognize who it's far.\"\nA painful quiet descended over the gathering as Kyras became one of the council contributors. Councilor Lyran, a thin person with sharp features and an air of conceit, had always been outspoken, frequently disagreeing with Tharros on matters of strategy. Lyran's expression clouded as the charge hovered in the air.\n\"That's absurd,\" Lyran said, rising from his seat. \"you are taking the word of an outsider over a devoted servant of Aquaria?\"\n\"Loyalty is meaningless if it's poisoned by greed,\" Tharros hissed. \"if you've betrayed us, I'll know.\"\nSophia experienced a surge of willpower. She closed her eyes and acted with the strength she only partially understood but could not deny. The murmurs she had once feared became threads she would wish to follow, bringing her to truths buried beneath layers of lies. As she opened her eyes, they gleamed slightly, and her voice became uncompromising.\n\"Lyran, display us your palms.\"\nLyran's expression faltered, and a worried look crossed his face. \"This is outrageous.\" You can't-\"\n\"Now,\" Sophia demanded, her voice resonating with authority that silenced the room.\nLyran reluctantly raised his hands. A small, sickening glow flashed from his fingertips, indicating the Leviathan's impact. Gasps echoed across the chamber, and Lyran's defiance shattered.\n\"I had no desire,\" he screamed, his voice shaking. \"The Leviathan's power is total. It promised me protection-for my own family and my people.\"\n\"And you endangered all of Aquaria during the procedure,\" Tharros yelled, his charm flashing. \"You've condemned countless lives together with your cowardice.\"\nLyran dropped to his knees, his equanimity shaken. \"I did not advise that it be moved a large distance. \"Please forgive me.\"\nThe council adjourned in disarray, the discovery creating a scar that would be impossible to mend. Lyran was hauled into custody, but the damage had already been done. Sophia joined Tharros to the balcony, which overlooked the town. The brilliance of Aquaria's coral networks appeared muted, as if the betrayal had contaminated even the water itself.\n\"This is my fault,\" Tharros said, his voice full of guilt.\nSophia placed a hand on his arm. \"you may't blame your self for someone else's choices.\"\nTharros shakes his head. \"I should've seen it. Lyran's goal has always presented an opportunity. \"I let my satisfaction blind me to the dangers.\"\n\"You relied on him,\" Sophia said softly. \"That's now not a weak spot.\"\n\"It's far while it charges lives,\" Tharros said, his expression darkening. \"The Leviathan didn't stop here. It's the use of worry to tear us apart, and it's working.\"\nSophia's solution deepened. \"Then we combat lower back. together.\"\nAs night settled over Aquaria, the metropolis tried to catch its breath. Sophia worked late into the night, honing her tool and prepared for the conflicts to resume. Kael joined her, providing soothing solidity.\n\"You need to rest,\" he said, watching her adjust the crystalline components.\n\"I can't,\" she replied, without looking up. \"not even as the Leviathan is out there, expecting us to slip.\"\nKael placed a hand on her shoulder and spoke softly. \"We receive nowadays. It's okay to take a moment to breathe.\nSophia finally glanced at him, her eyes tired out yet resolute. \"If we prevent, even for a 2d, we may not get any other threat.\"\nKael sighed, but didn't protest. He stayed by her side, like a quiet father or mother, as she worked.\nThe following morning brought a new nightmare. The skies over Aquaria, once colorful and teaming with sunlight, were now clouded in an ominous darkness. The waters felt thicker and chillier, as if the Leviathan's presence had permeated the present day.\nArin dashed into the battle room, her expression fading. \"It's began.\"\nSophia joined her at the window, her heart sinking from the sight. The shadow of the Leviathan loomed over the village, its form scarcely visible but unmistakable. The murmurs in her mind were stronger and more urgent.\nYou can't stop me.\nTharros entered with a sad expression. \"It's trying us out again. However, this time, it will not take long.\"\nSophia turned to face him, her voice firm despite the concern she was feeling. \"Then neither do we.\"\nThe council's condition improved after they regrouped. The Leviathan's shadow became more than just a possibility; it was a promise of catastrophe. And unless they act decisively, Aquaria may fall.\nHowever, beneath the terror, a spark of wish lingered. Sophia felt it in her comrades' determination, within the oneness that betrayal had not fractured. The Leviathan had underestimated them previously. It would not make that mistake again.\nSophia made a secret promise as the shadows clouded the skies. They might not go into this conflict unprepared. The fires of betrayal had tested them, but they would come out stronger-or die trying.\nThe First Breach\nThe darkness that enveloped Aquaria's skies pushed down on its people, a constant reminder of the Leviathan's impending danger. The metropolis' previously vibrant coral networks faded beneath the crushing gloom, their brilliance flickering like frail candles in a typhoon. Sophia stood at the edge of the war room's balcony, hands clinched, staring into the abyss.\n\"It's time,\" Tharros remarked as he stepped beside her. His voice was calm, but it had the weight of a ruler who had witnessed far too many conflicts.\nKael entered the chamber, his trident shimmering slightly against the light. \"Scouts record movement from the western trench. It is heading straight for the metropolis.\"\nArin joined them, her magic crackling softly around her fingertips. \"This is not a test.\" \"The Leviathan is making its move.\"\nSophia grew to be able to withstand them, and her resolve strengthened. \"Then we face it head-on. \"We will not let Aquaria fall.\"\nAlarms rang throughout the town, creating a haunting rhythm of urgency. Warriors took up positions along the outer walls, their weapons shimmering faintly with enchantments intended to fight the Leviathan's corrupted energies. The waters churned as if in anticipation, with the currents agitated and unpredictable.\nSophia was at the front, alongside Tharros, Kael, and Arin. Kyras, the Shark clan emissary, surrounded them, his demeanor gloomy but resolute.\n\"It's starting,\" Kael said, his voice steady.\nThe primary wave struck without notice. Twisted sea creatures, their bureaucracy hideous and unnatural, charged against the city's walls. The soldiers controlled the route, their strikes precise and unwavering. However, for every species they killed, more were expected to take its place.\nSophia's heart raced as she concentrated her hydrokinesis, creating powerful currents that pushed the creatures back. Arin's spells shimmered like a shielding dome, repelling attacks and providing their warriors with brief respites.\nTharros unleashed his dragon hearth, a scorching burst of heat that ripped through the enemy lines. Kael fought beside him, his trident a blur as he dispatched any thing that came too close.\n\"They're now not stopping,\" Kyras muttered, his blade slicing through a serpent-like beast. \"We want to push them again.\"\nSophia's instrument, the one she had worked so hard to perfect, pulsed faintly on her wrist. She ignited it, sending a shockwave through the sea. The creatures stumbled, their actions irregular, as their relationship with the Leviathan shifted briefly.\n\"Now!\" She shouted.\nThe warriors moved forward, pressing their advantage. For a brief while, it appeared that they might keep the line.\nThen the Leviathan acknowledged its presence.\nThe water became chillier and darker as a massive shadow passed across the depths. Its voice repeated in Sophia's mind, a haunting murmur that sent shivers down her spine.\nDid you think you could stop me?\nThe Leviathan's messengers, more larger and more powerful than the corrupted creatures, emerged from the darkness. Towering beings with dazzling eyes and jagged weaponry moved with horrifying accuracy, slicing through Aquaria's fortifications.\nSophia's pulse accelerated as one of the emissaries charged at her. She raised her fingers, unleashing a torrent of water that smacked into the thing, but it faltered somewhat. Kael intercepted it, his trident colliding with its blade in a shower of sparks.\n\"We're losing ground,\" Arin said, her voice straining as she cast another spell to protect the men.\nSophia's gaze moved to Tharros, who was fighting with another emissary. His dragon charisma flashed, yet his great power appeared only enough to keep his opponent at bay.\n\"We want more electricity,\" Sophia whispered, the certainty settling deeply in her chest.\nDesperation drove her forward. She moved away from the others, her mind racing. The whispers in her thoughts became stronger, encouraging and teasing her.\nYou already have access to electricity. Use it.\nSophia closed her eyes and went deep within herself. She could feel the power strands connecting her to Aquaria, the Leviathan, and something larger. It turned into a risky venture, but she had no alternative.\nWhen she opened her eyes, they shone with an extraordinary, unearthly gentleness. The water around her was alive with energy, spreading outward in waves that made even the Leviathan's emissaries pause.\n\"Sophia, what are you doing?\" Kael's voice became filled with alarm, but she couldn't find a solution.\nShe raised her arms, and the water responded. A massive whirlpool formed, drawing the emissaries toward its center. The sheer strain of it became astounding, and for a brief moment, it appeared that she may turn the tide.\nHowever, the excitement was tremendous. Sophia's body trembled as the lightning rushed through her, threatening to consume her. She should pay attention to the Leviathan's frigid, mocking laugh.\nYou couldn't control it. You will harm yourself.\n\"Sophia, stop!\" Tharros shouted, his voice cutting through the commotion.\nHowever, she was unable to stop. The power had seized control and ordered a launch. With a final shout, she unleashed a barrage of electricity that ripped through the battlefield, annihilating the emissaries and driving the Leviathan's warriors into retreat.\nThe seas stilled, and the war was won. However, the silence that followed became deafening.\nSophia slumped, her imaginative and clairvoyant abilities dimming as tiredness overwhelmed her. When she awoke, she was in the palace, surrounded by her partners. Their features were carved with the circumstance, but also with something else: worry.\n\"What passed off?\" She inquired, her tone just above a whisper.\nKael's expression was bleak. \"You stored us. but...\" He hesitated, looking at Tharros.\n\"however what?\" Sophia pressed, creating a knot in her stomach.\nArin spoke quietly, her tone guarded. \"The electricity you utilized was not solely your own. It was historical and perilous. Even the Leviathan seemed afraid of it.\"\nSophia's coronary heart dropped. She gazed at Tharros, whose golden eyes were filled with a mixture of thankfulness and anxiety.\n\"We will figure it out,\" he said firmly. \"collectively.\"\nHowever, Sophia was unsure. The recollection of the energy persisted, a dark and enticing pressure that threatened to engulf her.\nAnd as she looked out the window at the Leviathan's shadow still looming over the city, she realized the conflict was far from ended. If anything, it had most likely just started.\nFractured Awakening\nA frigid ripple drew Sophia from the depths of her unconsciousness. Her eyelids flickered open, and her physique felt strange and flimsy, as if her limbs had been replaced with brittle coral. The ceiling above her shimmered gently, lit by bioluminescent lighting fixtures that moved like cautious fireflies. She changed into lower back at Aquaria's palace, but the weight in her chest warned her that everything had altered drastically.\n\"Sophia,\" Tharros' deep voice rumbled, a combination of warmth and reserved difficulty. He sat at her bedside, his powerful presence softened by worry. His bright eyes scanned her face for indications of popularity.\n\"Tharros,\" she said softly, her voice scarcely audible. It felt like sand was scraping through her throat.\nBefore she could say anything else, Arin looked around, her delicate hands shimmering with gentle, green magic. Kael trailed behind her, his trident draped across his back, his visage dismal yet hopeful.\n\"You gave us quite the scare,\" Arin murmured, kneeling beside her. \"stay still; you've been via greater than your body can deal with.\"\nSophia closed her eyes, flashbacks of the struggle flashing through her mind. The Leviathan's resounding laughter. The burning flash of power that had erupted from her core, tearing through both friend and foe alike. Then comes darkness.\n\"What came about?\" Her voice broke, the question tinted with guilt.\n\"You saved Aquaria,\" Tharros replied, but his tone included an unspoken caveat. \"however the electricity you wielded-it almost ate up you.\"\nSophia shuddered. She remembered the draw of historical power, how intoxicating it had been, and how much it had worried her.\n\"Is every person... secure?\"\nKael moved closer, his voice quiet yet firm. \"You grew to become the tide of the struggle, but the Leviathan retreated. Its corruption is spreading over other kingdoms. We held the line, but the combat is far from over.\"\nArin's power swept across Sophia's chest, calming her strained anxieties. \"You cannot bear this burden by yourself. That electricity-you weren't allowed to transport it without steering.\"\nSophia's coronary heart twisted. The Leviathan's voice rang in her memory, a disturbing reminder of how close she'd been to killing herself.\nYou will never have control over it. It will take control of you.\nHer fingers trembled as she clutched the bed's barrier. \"What if I hurt someone next time?\"\n\"You didn't receive it,\" Tharros replied firmly, giving up hers. \"No longer, even though we are right here. We will assist you. collectively.\"\nThe earnestness in his voice grounded her. She looked at Kael, who gave her a curt nod, then Arin, whose enigmatic smile disguised her own anxieties.\nSophia wanted to believe what they said, but the darkness at the edge of her recognition shouted differently.\nThe periods observed were demanding. Sophia's recovery was slow, as her body suffered from the strain of channeling such colossal force. Tharros often remained by her side, offering modest words of encouragement. Kael pushed her to restore her physical energy, his drills brutal but necessary. Arin concentrated on calming the magic within her, teaching her strategies for suppressing surges.\nDespite their attempts, Sophia became increasingly uneasy. The Leviathan's voice had gone mute during the conflict, but its presence lingered in her desires. Every night, she saw darkness swallow Aquaria and heard the laments of its inhabitants.\nSophia stepped up to the balcony one night while the palace was sleeping. The sea stretched on indefinitely before her, its calm surface belying the fury beneath. She closed her eyes in search of peace in the silence, but the memories refused to let her rest.\n\"You shouldn't be out here alone,\" Tharros murmured, stepping into view. His gaze lingered on her faded features.\n\"I couldn't sleep,\" she explained.\nHe joined her, the silence between them filled with unsaid anxieties. \"You are stronger than you realize, Sophia. However, strength does not imply facing everything alone.\nShe looked at him, searching his face for the truth behind his words. \"What if I can't do it next time? What if I become the monster I'm attempting to defeat?\"\nTharros' expression stiffened. \"You won't, since you are no longer alone in this. \"Consider us.\"\nSophia wanted to. She needed to. However, doubt gnawed at her resolve.\nDays progressed into weeks. Sophia pushed herself harder, determined to master her abilities. The Leviathan's retreat had provided Aquaria with a reprieve, but everyone knew it would only be brief. Scouts reported encounters with corrupted beasts near neighboring kingdoms. The council became restless, and rumors of discontent spread like wildfire.\nSophia felt energy surge throughout her one afternoon while attending an education session with Kael. It grew without care, a tidal wave of electricity threatening to overflow.\n\"focus!\" Kael barked, grasping her shoulders. \"Control it.\" \"Do not let it control you.\"\nSophia clenched her fists, her breathing harsh. She imagined the faces of the people she struggled to protect, and the friends who believed in her. Slowly, the surge subsided, leaving her depleted yet constant.\n\"Properly,\" Kael said, his voice quieter. \"You're getting there.\"\nShe nodded, despite feeling exhausted. Each step forward felt like a battle in itself.\nLater that night, as she napped, Arin went to her chamber. The theme helped to soften the ocean witch's usually harsh temperament.\n\"There's something you should see,\" Arin said, guiding Sophia to her tower.\nThe area became filled with luminous orbs, each revealing a vision of the Leviathan's corruption spreading throughout the waters. A once-thriving town lay in ruins, its inhabitants fueled by insanity.\n\"That is what we're up against,\" Arin said, her voice quiet. \"but there's something else.\"\nShe waved her hand, and a historical text appeared in the air. The words shone dimly, written in a language Sophia recognized.\n\"It's a prophecy,\" Arin explained. \"It speaks of a person who can wield the powers of dragon, merfolk, and sea witch to either save or ruin Aquaria.\"\nSophia's blood was bloodless. \"you suspect that's me?\"\nArin nodded. \"The signs and symptoms affect you. However, the prophecy is unclear on your position. It may go both ways.\nSophia focused on the written material, the weight of the future crushing down on her. \"What if I fail?\"\nArin's gaze softened. \"Then we will pick you up. Sophia, you're not doing this alone anymore. \"I understand that.\"\nSophia returned to her chamber as the night became darker, her mind racing with thoughts of the prophecy. Sleep evaded her, and the shadows seemed to murmur her name.\nSuddenly, a cold breeze blew through the room. The lights darkened, and the Leviathan's voice resonated in her mind.\nDo you think you have control over the power? It will wreck you. And when it does, I'll be prepared.\nSophia gasped, her heart racing. The room fell silent again, but the Leviathan's words lingered, a terrible reminder of the struggle that was still to come.\nAnd for the first time, she wondered if she truly had the strength to face it.\nThe Leviathan’s Retreat\nThe frightening silence following Sophia's encounter with the Leviathan did not last long. The royal corridors quickly filled with frantic footfall, hurried murmurs, and the echo of urgent orders. Scouts returned with news that should have brought hope, but instead increased the anxiety that had settled over Aquaria.\nSophia sat in a niche of the council chamber, her fingers delicately caressing the smooth armrest of the coral-crafted chair. The words of the Leviathan rang in her memory, a mocking reminder that its retreat was anything but a surrender.\n\"They've fallen back,\" Kael announced, standing before of the assembled commanders. His speech grew more constant, but the tightness in his jaw indicated his irritation. \"But it's not over. The Leviathan is reorganizing, spreading corruption throughout the outer kingdoms. We cannot mistake this for victory.\"\nMurmurs spread around the room. The senior council members exchanged apprehensive glances, while others openly murmured amongst themselves.\nSophia looked up at Tharros, who stood motionless at the top of the hall. His golden eyes scanned the gathering, his presence imposing despite the growing conflict.\nKael continued to pace, barely moving. \"Scouts reported sightings of corrupted marine creatures beyond the Coral Expanse. Previously thriving villages are now cloaked in gloom. \"If we do not act-\"\nA harsh voice interrupted him. \"And whose fault is that?\"\nSophia froze when Elder Varyon, the Shark Clans' senior representative, stood. His gaze pierced the room like a blade, landing solidly on her.\n\"This human,\" he spat, moving closer to Sophia, \"brought her turmoil to Aquaria. And now the Leviathan is aware of our location and is focused on our technique buddies.\"\nSophia's breath caught. The room burst into a cacophony of voices. Some echoed Varyon's view, but others rallied to her defense.\n\"enough!\" Tharros' words rang out, silencing the room. His look became intense. \"We're not here to point fingers, but to strategize. Elder Varyon, when you have answers, speak them. If not, sit down.\"\nThe elder's lips thinned, but he returned to his seat, his dissatisfaction clear.\nSophia swallowed the lump in her throat, her fists holding the armrest firmly. She wanted to speak, to protect herself, but her voice felt crushed beneath the weight of their stares.\nArin, sitting beside her, leaned in and said, \"Let them argue.\" Their words cannot replace the reality of what you've done for Aquaria.\"\nBut Sophia was not so optimistic.\nThe meeting dragged on, with each report revealing more sad information. Coral cities in the western territories were succumbing to the Leviathan's impact. When the colourful bioluminescent reefs darkened, their electricity ran out. Whole populations had left, while others had disappeared entirely.\n\"We want to act,\" Kael stated firmly, putting his fingers on the table. \"waiting will handiest support the Leviathan's grip.\"\n\"And weaken ours,\" another council member countered. \"If we flow our forces, Aquaria might be left inclined.\"\nSophia finally found her voice. \"If we do nothing, we're susceptible anyway.\"\nAll eyes grew to focus on her. She forced herself to look up, despite the fact that her legs felt unsteady under her. \"The Leviathan is not retiring; it is shifting. It is spreading its corruption, causing turmoil and dividing us. If we don't band together and fight until the end, we'll lose everything.\"\nHer words floated in the air.",

        "content": "Elder Varyon scoffed. \"bold phrases from a person who has no place on this council.\"\nSophia's chest constricted, but before she could respond, Tharros moved forward. His appearance immediately quiet the whispers.\n\"She has each area right here,\" he said, his voice steely. \"Sophia battled for Aquaria when others failed. \"If we all question her loyalty, they will question mine.\"\nThe weight of his words settled heavily in the room.\nAs the council dispersed, Sophia waited within the chamber, her mind racing. She felt a presence behind her and grew into the peer Kael.\n\"They'll come around,\" he said, nonchalantly leaning against the table. \"They're just terrified. Worry causes individuals to say dumb things.\nSophia offered a small smile. \"You sound such as you've treated it before.\"\n\"more times than I'd like to admit.\"\nTharros approached with a softer expression. \"Do not allow them get to you. \"They'll see reality in time.\"\n\"but will it be too late?\" Sophia asked quietly.\nSophia sat in her chamber that night, unable to shake the unease that was creeping up on her. The Leviathan's words echoed in her head, each phrase a reminder of the impending struggle.\nA knock on the door jolted her from her reverie. It was Arin, and her normal self-confidence had transformed with unusual hesitancy.\n\"There's something you ought to see,\" the sea witch murmured, motioning Sophia to look.\nArin brought her to the observatory, a wide, open space with windows that overlooked the vast ocean. The area was poorly lit, with the illumination of the ocean outside casting shadows across the dividers.\nArin waved her hand, and an image appeared in the middle of the room. It became an imagined and forerunner of one of the outer kingdoms, with its coral constructions blackened and rendered obsolete. Shadows moved through the streets, their shapes distorted and strange.\n\"This is what we're up against,\" Arin remarked quietly. \"The Leviathan's corruption does more than just break; it consumes. \"The longer we wait, the stronger it becomes.\nSophia felt her stomach twist as she glanced at the sight. \"What are we able to do?\"\nArin became to her, her gaze piercing. \"We engage in combat. However, we must be smarter than it. The Leviathan is more than just a beast; it is a strategist. It is examining us and looking for flaws.\"\nSophia nodded, her dedication strengthening her determination. \"Then we are able to't let it discover any.\"\nAs daylight broke, the castle was buzzing with activity. Scouts prepped for their upcoming missions, while warriors honed their weapons. Sophia joined Kael on the schooling grounds, pushing herself harder than ever.\n\"You're more powerful than you realize,\" Kael remarked as she held her breath.\n\"I must be,\" she answered. \"For Aquaria.\"\nThe day concluded with another council assembly, this time to finalize their method. Plans had been laid out, alliances were discussed, and decisions had been taken. However, because the meeting had ended, Sophia couldn't shake the feeling that they were still one step behind.\nThat night, when she looked out over the sea, the Leviathan's voice resonated all over again.\nSophia, you are playing my reenactment. You're already plummeting.\nShe clinched her hands, her solution unshakable. \"no longer this time.\"\nBut deep inside, she wondered if she really had the energy to win.\nShadows in the Deep\nSophia's nights had become a battlefield. Dreams, dazzling and inescapable, drew her into corrupted aquatic cities dominated by twisted and lifeless coral towers. Shadowy creatures with holey, glittering eyes groped for her, their whispers a chorus of sadness. She awoke every morning drenched in perspiration, her heart racing as if she had been walking for her life. On each occasion, she discovered Arin standing by her bedside, her look a mix of terror and clarity.\n\"It's the Leviathan,\" Arin explained after another sleepless night. Her voice became quiet but firm. \"Its reach goes deeper than we expected. \"These are echoes of its corruption.\"\nSophia's fists clutched the blankets. \"Then it's inside my head?\"\nArin's eyes narrowed. \"Not but.\" However, if you don't tackle it, your dreams will swallow you.\nSophia looked through the darkening window, the vast ocean pressing against the glass. \"How?\" she whispered. \"How do I face some thing so sizeable?\"\n\"via remembering you're now not alone.\"\nEven while Sophia fought with her nightmares, Kael's challenge pushed him to the limits of Aquaria's power. The outer kingdoms, once known for their bioluminescent beauty, were now unrecognizable. Kael led his crew cautiously, each movement barely audible in the darkness. The coral cities they left behind were husks of their former selves, with their vibrant colors fading and replaced by an oppressive blackness that clung to the ocean like tar.\n\"It's worse than we thought,\" Kael said, his voice barely audible. His second-in-command, Lira, nodded grimly.\nThe group's bioluminescent lamps cast spooky shadows as they moved forward. Kael's acute eyes caught movement in the distance-a flare of something odd. He raised his hand, signaling the group to cease. The water felt heavier just here, and each breath became an effort.\n\"Live alert,\" Kael instructed. \"We're not on my own.\"\nUnexpectedly, a shadow dashed at them. It moved with unusual speed, its shape twisting and altering. Kael hardly had time to draw his weapon before the beast approached them. Its entire eyes focused on him, and a guttural scream echoed through the sea.\n\"protective formation!\" Kael shouted. The squad reacted immediately, forming a circle as the beast lashed out.\nThe struggle was chaotic. The creature's movements defied logic, as each attack seemed to drain the brightness from its surroundings. Kael's blade struck its target, cutting through the shadowy figure, but the beast vanished into the darkness before regenerating moments later.\n\"we are able to't fight this aspect like ordinary!\" Lira shouted.\nKael gritted his enamel. \"Fall has returned! \"Regroup at the rendezvous factor!\"\nThey moved together, retreating into the stifling blackness. The beast chased them, its screams reverberating in their ears. Kael's heart hammered as he guided his troops through the maze of useless coral and shadows. Sooner or later, a flash of bioluminescent light indicated their escape. The thing recoiled and disappeared into the darkness.\nKael paused to gather his breath, his palms quivering. \"We must warn Aquaria,\" he added, his tone harsh. \"This corruption is spreading quicker than we notion.\"\nSophia returned to Aquaria and joined Tharros in the struggle chamber. The dragon king's attitude was as stoic as usual, but Sophia could see the stress in his eyes.\n\"Kael's file confirms our fears,\" Tharros stated, pointing to the holographic map of the distant kingdoms. \"The Leviathan's corruption is moving faster than we expected.\"\nSophia's gaze lingered on the black portions of the map. \"We need to act.\"\n\"And we are capable,\" Tharros responded. \"However, we will not do this recklessly.\" The Leviathan is playing a long game, and we're already behind it.\"\nArin entered the room with a sad expression. \"The goals are a caution,\" she remarked. \"They are no longer just visions of Leviathan's depravity. \"They're showing us what will happen if we fail.\nSophia's stomach twisted. \"Then we will't manage to pay for to fail.\"\nTharros rested a hand on her shoulder, his touch anchoring. \"We won't, but we do want to be clever. Kael's scouting has provided us with valuable statistics. Now is the time to put it into action.\"\nKael's return was received with a mix of relief and dread. His report left little doubt: the Leviathan's effect was spreading, and time was running out. As the council met, tensions rose dramatically.\n\"We're facing annihilation,\" Elder Varyon said, his voice harsh. \"And yet, we are still debating? That is craziness.\"\n\"Going into battle without a plan is insane,\" Tharros answered, his voice steady but firm. \"We want unity, now not panic.\"\nSophia's voice pierced through the worry. \"The Leviathan feeds on our anxieties. \"If we let it divide us, we've already lost.\"\nThe room went silent. All eyes were on her.\n\"We want a plan,\" she said. \"One that makes use of our strengths.\" Arin, you have researched the Leviathan's magic. \"Is there any way to weaken it?\"\nArin nodded slowly. \"Its corruption thrives on inequality. If we can undermine its effect, even temporarily, it will provide us the opportunity we seek.\"\nSophia changed to Kael. \"What about the outer kingdoms?\" \"Can we rally any allies?\"\nKael's jaws constricted. \"It's not clean. The majority of them are already fed up with corruption. But there are survivors. If we succeed, they may become a part of us.\"\nTharros' gaze moved across the room. \"Then that is our mission.\" We disrupt the Leviathan's magic, gather what allies we can, and take the fight to it.\"\nThe council mumbled their agreement, but terror lingered in their eyes.\nAs the arrangements began, Sophia found herself on a balcony facing the sea. The Leviathan's voice lingered in her consciousness, its insults serving as a constant reminder of the previous conflict.\nYou are nothing, Sophia. Only a frail human attempting to play hero.\nShe clinched her fists, her translucent skin hardening. \"I am greater than you think you studied. I'll show it.\"\nTharros' voice pierced through the silence behind her. \"You don't must do that alone.\"\nShe turned to face him, her gaze finding his. \"I realize. \"But that doesn't make it any less terrifying.\"\nTharros moved closer, his presence solidifying. \"Courage is not the absence of fear, Sophia.\" It's confronting it head on.\nShe nodded, letting the weight of his words sink in. They stood in silence, watching at the waves as the sun fell below the horizon.\nThe primary blow came without warning. As Aquaria's soldiers began to work, a wave of shadows came upon them. The Leviathan's creatures swarmed, sending screams through the ocean.\nSophia stood at the forefront, her power bursting into life as she faced the approaching mob. Tharros, beside her, transformed into a dragon, lighting up the battlefield. Kael and Arin joined the fray, their combined energy illuminating the darkness.\nBut the Leviathan geared up. Its presence loomed, a murky bulk that appeared to consume the mild itself. Sophia felt a shiver down her spine as its voice boomed across the battlefield.\nYou cannot win. This planet is mine.\nShe gritted her teeth, her determination unwavering. \"no longer today.\"\nThe conflict continued, with Aquaria's fate hanging by a thread. As the shadows closed in, Sophia realized the main struggle had only just begun.\nPolitical Tensions Rise\nThe war's aftermath transformed into a delicate stillness. The shadows retreated, but the devastation remained. Aquaria's forces had barely survived, and the cost was high. Sophia sat by herself on the council chamber stairs, her head resting in her hands. Her body ached from the effort of combat, but the weight in her chest became heavier.\nTharros found her there, his dragon shape having seen that shed for a long time, yet his presence still carried commanding force.\n\"You fought properly,\" he remarked, his voice low and steady.\nSophia looked up, her expression unreadable. \"Did I? Or did I simply give them another reason to detest me?\nTharros crouched ahead of her, his golden gaze locked upon hers. \"They are concerned about what they do not recognize. But anxiety can be transformed into power. You've proven your loyalty. \"Now you want to show them your heart.\"\nSophia pushed her lips into a thin line. \"if they'll pay attention.\"\nThe council room was alive with activity the next day. Whispers resonated off coral partitions, with each faction on a facet. Elder Varyon's strong tone cut through the whispers as he stood in the middle of the room.\n\"This outsider has brought nothing but chaos,\" he said, his voice resonating with authority. \"The Leviathan is aware of our weakness because of her. \"And now our outer kingdoms are falling like dominoes!\"\nSophia tightened her jaw as she stood at the chamber's threshold. Kael's hand rested on her shoulder, a quiet gesture of assistance. Tharros, seated at the apex of the council, let Varyon's allegations hang in the air before speaking.\n\"Sophia saved lives,\" Tharros stated, his tone chilly but controlled. \"with out her, many of our warriors might now not have returned.\"\n\"And yet the Leviathan grows stronger,\" Varyon responded. \"Her presence brings instability to our realm.\"\nSophia's heart was pounding, but before she could speak, another voice rose. It became Lira, Kael's second in command.\n\"Instability existed here long before she arrived,\" Lira said, stepping forward. \"The Leviathan's corruption did not begin with Sophia.\" \"To blame her is a coward's excuse.\"\nThe chamber exploded in dispute. Voices clashed, accusations flew, and coherence seemed further away than ever.\nLater that night, Tharros convened an emergency assembly on the main plaza. The distance, illuminated by bioluminescent spheres, is filled with Aquaria's inhabitants. Warriors, students, and merchants all gathered, their faces filled with concern and exhaustion.\nSophia stood next to Tharros on the raised platform. Her palms trembled, but she willed herself to be cool. This became her challenge to prove herself.\nTharros advanced first. His voice, loud and deep, piqued the group's curiosity.\n\"Aquaria stands at a crossroads,\" he said. \"The Leviathan's shadow grows, and we face a choice between unity and destruction. But we can't fight this struggle split.\"\nHe maintained a continuous stare on Sophia. \"Sophia Rodriguez battled beside us. She bled for Aquaria. \"And now she can speak.\"\nSophia walked forward, and the muttering became louder. She took a long breath, her voice steady despite the weight of their attention.\n\"I realise I'm an intruder,\" she began. \"I recognize many of you do not trust me. I don't blame you. I arrived here by accident, and my presence has resulted in difficult conditions I never could have envisioned.\"\nShe paused to study the gathering. Some of the faces were suspicious, while others were curious. She pushed on.\n\"However, I have seen what the Leviathan can do. I've witnessed the darkness it creates and the lives it kills. and that I've chosen to fight against it. I do it now because I care about Aquaria, not because I'm compelled to. Approximately its human inhabitants.\"\nHer voice became more powerful, and her emotions poured into her words.\n\"I have fought alongside your warriors. I've witnessed their bravery and sacrifice. and that I've grown to like this location. Aquaria is more than a kingdom to me. \"It has become my domestic.\"\nA silence swept over the crowd. Sophia's comments hung in the air, honest and sincere.\n\"I don't ask on your accept as true with,\" she said softly. \"I appeal for your togetherness. The Leviathan doesn't care who we are or where we're from. It wants to destroy everything. And the only way we can stop it is together.\"\nThere was a brief moment of stillness. Then, a lone voice was referred to as \"out of the group.\"\n\"She's right.\"\nIt was a younger mermaid, her expression sincere. Others began to murmur about their settlement. The tide of opinion altered slowly, but not totally. Elder Varyon's scowl remained focused at the back, and a small handful of his supporters appeared as unconvinced.\nTharros moved forward again, his presence imposing.",

        "content": "\"This isn't always the time for department,\" he told me. \"We should stand together, or we will fall on our own. The Leviathan is our enemy; we are no longer separate.\"\nThe group's murmurs became louder, indicating a mix of agreement and opposition. The meeting concluded without a clear result, but Sophia's words lingered in the thoughts of many.\nThat night, Sophia sat on the edge of her bed, exhausted. Arin came at the doorway, her look unreadable.\n\"You did well,\" Arin replied, entering the room.\nSophia gave a vulnerable smile. \"It didn't sense like enough.\"\nArin's gaze softened. \"It's the beginning. And sometimes that's all we need.\nSophia's gaze shifted to the window, where the vast ocean stretched on indefinitely. The Leviathan's shadow hung in her imagination, serving as a constant reminder of the conflict ahead.\n\"We're going for walks out of time,\" she said quietly.\nArin nodded. \"Then we make each moment rely.\"\nThe Leviathan stirred in the sea's depths. Its depravity spread deeper, and the whispers became louder. It had sensed the tremors of harmony in Aquaria and would not allow them to go unchallenged.\nA sinister giggle resonated down the abyss, terrifying and menacing.\nAllow them to collect their energy. It will make their fall even sweeter.\nAquaria was in an increasingly precarious situation after the assembly. Citizens debated quietly while the council gathered behind closed doors. Sophia plunged herself into preparations, working furiously with Tharros, Kael, and Arin. She felt the weight of Aquaria's gaze on her, each glance a combination of yearning and mistrust.\n\"They're watching you,\" Kael said one night as they studied maps of the outlying kingdoms. His tone softened, but his expression became more intense.\n\"Allow them to,\" Sophia replied, her voice determined. \"I am no longer here to prove them wrong. \"I am here to keep them.\"\nKael grinned softly. \"Spoken like a real warrior.\"\nElder Varyon, however, refused to budge. His faction's dissatisfaction grew louder, and their accusations sharper. Rumors circulate that he is rallying support to remove Sophia from Aquaria entirely. Tharros confronted him during a council meeting, his stamina wearing thin.\n\"Your moves sow department at a time when we need cohesion,\" Tharros said, his voice icy. \"If you have a plan to combat the Leviathan, share it. Otherwise, move apart.\nVaryon's eyes narrowed. \"My aim is to protect Aquaria from additional corruption. We'll start with her. He pointed toward Sophia, his tone tinged with contempt.\nSophia stood, her voice slashing through the tension. \"You do not have to accept as true with me, Elder Varyon. But if you stand in the way of what needs to be accomplished, you're no better than Leviathan.\"\nThe room went silent. Varyon's look blazed into her, but he said nothing.\nSophia entered Arin's mystical cloister that evening. The area sprang alive with bright runes and swirling power, providing a dramatic contrast to the worry outside.\n\"The Leviathan feeds on fear and discord,\" Arin explained, her hands weaving complex patterns in the air. \"It isn't only a war of power. \"It's a war of will.\"\nSophia saw the enchantment expand while her mind raced. \"Then we have to reveal it we're no longer afraid.\"\nArin nodded. \"easier said than done.\" \"But you've already taken the first step.\"\nSophia's gaze lingered on the glowing runes, their light a flicker of longing against the looming darkness.\nThe next morning, Tharros addressed the council once more. His voice remained constant, but the undercurrent of desperation became obvious.\n\"We cannot find the money for further delays,\" he told me. \"The Leviathan becomes stronger with each second we delay. \"It's time to behave.\"\nSophia advanced, her gaze sweeping across the council. \"I will lead the expedition to the outlying kingdoms. We want and need allies right now.\"\nKael nodded in agreement. \"I will go with her. We will bring back whomever we can.\"\nThe council grumbled to themselves, but Tharros stopped them with a single look.\n\"Then it's decided,\" he said. \"Put together for departure.\" And may the tides guide you.\"\nAs Sophia and Kael exited the chamber, a sense of reason descended on her. The road ahead had become hazardous, but for the first time, she felt prepared to face it.\nThe Leviathan remained in the depths, watching. Its dark eyes glimmered with hatred, and its corrupting tendrils unfolded accordingly. It felt a stirring of resistance in Aquaria and enjoyed the project.\nLet them come, is the notion. They will only discover depression.\nAs the abyssal darkness deepened, the battle for Aquaria's soul began.\nBonds of Trust\nAquaria's educational grounds resonated with the piercing collision of weapons and the steady beat of drills. Sophia stood in the center, clutching her trident with shaky hands. The previous weeks had been exhausting, a whirl of teaching and strategy, but Kael was now demanding more.\n\"Once more,\" Kael's voice rang out, firm and unwavering.\nSophia's muscles burned as she rushed forward, her movements slower than usual. Kael quickly blocked her strike, his own weapon a blur of action.\n\"You're hesitating,\" he remarked, his voice stern. \"The Leviathan will not provide you a two-dimensional threat. \"Neither will I.\"\nSophia's chest tightened with anger. She strengthened her grasp, spinning into another strike. This time, her strike was faster and fiercer. Kael's visage changed, a flash of approval breaking through his harsh exterior. However, he did not give up.\n\"Better,\" he repeated, his voice steady. \"however no longer properly sufficient.\"\nSophia's irritability boiled over. \"I am trying! \"What else do you want from me?\"\nKael dropped his weapon, his piercing stare fixed on hers. I want you to live on. To win. If you do not push yourself past your boundaries today, you will not be able to face a threat when it comes along.\"\nHis words cut through her fury, leaving the most effective dedication in their wake. Sophia nodded, wiping sweat off her forehead. \"Again,\" she said, her tone stern.\nKael's lips twitched into a little smile. \"That's greater like it.\"\nSophia hurried to Arin's sanctum as the sun fell below the horizon, lighting up Aquaria in blue and gold. The sea witch's location became a dramatic contrast to the reliant education grounds. The air here was filled with enchantment, and dazzling runes danced along the coral barriers.\nArin stood in the center, her arms weaving complex patterns in the water. Sophia gazed, enthralled by the swirling currents that followed Arin's every instruction.\n\"You're past due,\" Arin replied without turning, her tone amused.\nSophia came closer, her limbs still throbbing from Kael's drills. \"Kael decided I needed some more rounds.\"\nArin looked over her shoulder, her sharp eyes gleaming with amusement. \"I am not amazed. He's unrelenting. \"But so am I.\"\nSophia moaned. \"splendid.\"\nArin's laugh became gentle but genuine. She indicated for Sophia to register for her. \"Hydrokinesis is not about pressure. It approximates precision. manipulate. Display to me what you've learned.\"\nSophia closed her eyes and focused on the water around her. She extended her hand, urging the currents to bow to her will. A tendril of water rose, twisting and swirling, yet its movements were awkward and disorganized.\n\"Prevent fighting it,\" Arin said, her voice kind yet firm. \"Water is not your enemy. It is an extension of you.\"\nSophia exhaled slowly, relieved of her frustration. She tried again, and this time the water flowed smoothly, mirroring her movements. A smile tugged on her lips.\n\"Higher,\" Arin replied, nodding in agreement. \"But don't become comfy. The Leviathan's magic will disrupt everything you know. You need to be prepared for that.\"\nSophia's spine relaxed as she felt the Leviathan's point. \"Have you watched so we can prevent it?\" she said quietly.\nArin's eyes softened, a flicker of vulnerability passing through her functions. \"I believe we must attempt. \"That is all we will do.\"\nSophia detected Arin's reluctance in his words, as if there was something unspoken. But before she could press, Arin looked away, her confident demeanor snapping back into place.\nSophia's schooling became more intense as days turned into weeks. Kael's persistent workouts pushed her to the brink, forcing her to confront her anxieties and shortcomings. Arin's teachings taught her elegance, the precise balance of strength and control. Throughout it all, Tharros was a steady presence, offering empathy when her doubts threatened to consume her.\nTharros joined Sophia one night while she dozed on the palace balcony. The dragon king's golden eyes fixed on the distant bioluminescent glow of the ocean.\n\"You're making progress,\" he said softly and reassuringly.\nSophia leaned in opposition to the railing, her gaze remote. \"It does not feel like enough. The Leviathan is more powerful than anything I've ever encountered. \"What if I am not ready?\"\nTharros placed a hand on her shoulder, the weight of his presence anchoring her. \"Nobody is ever truly prepared for the fights that rely. But you don't have to confront it by yourself. Remember the fact that.\"\nHis words washed over her like a warm flood, relieving the strain in her chest. \"Thank you,\" she said softly.\nTharros grinned slightly. \"Rest tonight. The actual work begins the following day.\nSophia stood inside the educational grounds again the next morning, this time surrounded by Kael and Arin. Their combined presence became daunting, yet it also filled her with a sense of motivation.\n\"Today, we're pushing your limits,\" Kael stated, his tone leaving no room for debate.\nArin smirked. \"And teaching you the way to live on them.\"\nSophia nodded, her resolve growing stronger. \"let's do this.\"\nThe consultation became unlike anything she had previously encountered. Kael's workouts were severe, his movements precise and relentless. Each clash of their weapons sent shockwaves through the sea, challenging her patience. Arin's magic swirled about them, creating limits and demanding scenarios that forced Sophia to conform on the fly.\nKael disarmed her at one point, his blade preventing a simple slash to her throat. \"By no means let your protector down,\" he advised.\nSophia clenched her enamel as she retrieved her sword. \"I gained't make that mistake once more.\"\nArin's voice lowered through the tension. \"top. due to the fact the Leviathan received't display mercy.\"\nThe depth of the training pushed Sophia to her breaking point, yet she refused to give up. She learned from each failure. With each accomplishment, her confidence grew.\nAs the day came to an end, the three of them stood silently, their breathing heavy. Kael interrupted the silence, his tone lower than usual. \"You probably did well these days.\" \"Higher than I expected.\"\nSophia maintained a sleepy smile. \"high reward coming from you.\"\nArin giggled, the sound easing the mood. \"Do not let it go to your head. \"The next day could be even tougher.\"\nSophia grumbled, but there was no denying the joy in her eyes. She became stronger than she had ever been before, and for the first time, she believed in her own strength.\nThat night, Sophia sat alone in her chamber, the events of the day replaying in her mind. She recalled Kael's unwavering field, Arin's incisive wit, and Tharros' unfailing understanding. They've been more than allies. They were her anchor in the hurricane.\nHowever, even anchors can falter. She'd noticed the flaws in Arin's strong facade, the shadows that remained in her gaze. There was something Arin was not telling her, and it weighed heavily on her.\nSophia's thoughts were interrupted by a slight knock on the door. She opened it and saw Arin standing there, her look unreadable.\n\"can we talk?\" Arin requested, her voice unusually subdued.\nSophia stepped apart, signaling for her to enter. \"Of the way. What about your thoughts?\"\nArin hesitated, her usual self-assurance replaced with uncertainty. \"There is something you want to comprehend. \"Something about the Leviathan.\"\nSophia felt her heart skip a beat. \"what is it?\"\nArin met her stare, and Sophia saw terror in her eyes for the first time. \"It isn't just a beast. \"It is a part of me.\"\nThe truth hit Sophia like a tidal wave, sending her reeling. Questions flew through her mind, but one idea stood out above the rest.\nWhat does this signify to anyone?\nThe Prophecy Unveiled\nThe tension in the room was apparent. Arin's confession hung in the air, and Sophia's mind was racing with thoughts. The weight of Arin's words sent her reeling. She couldn't connect the confident sea witch she had grown to know with Arin's fearful expression.\n\"What do you mean it's a part of you?\" Sophia asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\nArin sighed and paced the chamber. \"The Leviathan's magic isn't simply ancient. It has something to do with myself and my family history. My family served as both guardians and jailers. However, over generations, that relationship has twisted. Its darkness seeps into us, attempting to seize what remains of its power.\"\nSophia's stomach turned. \"Why didn't you tell me?\"\nArin paused, her gaze piercing. \"Because I wasn't sure I could control it. \"If I falter or give in...\" She trailed off, her voice breaking. \"I can't let that happen.\"\nSophia stretched out and rested her palm on Arin's arm. \"You will not. We will work this out. Together.\"",

        "content": "Arin's countenance relaxed, but the fear in her eyes persisted. \"There is something else. \"I found something in the tower that you should see.\"\nThe coral tower remained motionless, its spires shining softly in the pale light. Arin guided Sophia up the curving staircase, the air becoming heavier with each step. At the top, a chamber led into a room packed with old writings and glowing relics. The aura here was strong, a combination of magic and history.\nArin moved to a pedestal, where an ancient tome sat, its edges ragged from age. She cautiously opened it, exposing pages covered in complicated script and diagrams. The lettering shimmered faintly, as if alive.\n\"This is the Prophecy of the Three,\" Arin stated quietly. \"It describes a being who embodies the power of dragons, mermaids, and sea witches. \"A being destined to save or destroy Aquaria.\"\nSophia moved closer, her gaze searching the pages. The words were foreign, but they appeared to strike a chord with her. \"It's talking about me, isn't it?\"\nArin nodded. \"The description matches. \"The markings on your skin, your connection to Tharros, Kael, and me-it's all here.\"\nSophia's heart pounded. \"What does it say about my role?\"\nArin paused, her fingertips tracing the text. \"That is the problem. It is ambiguous. It claims you have the ability to unite the factions and restore equilibrium. \"If the balance is disrupted, the same power can destroy everything.\"\nSophia's chest tightened. \"So, I am a gambler. A risk.\"\n\"No,\" Arin answered firmly. \"You are a chance. \"The best chance we have.\"\nSharing the prophecy with Tharros and Kael was not easy. The four of them assembled in the war chamber, the tome positioned between them like a live being. Tharros' golden eyes searched the pages, his face opaque. Kael's jaw tightened, and his hands rested on the table as if to stabilize himself.\n\"This changes nothing,\" Tharros answered after a long pause. \"Sophia is our ally. Our anchor. This prophecy just validates what we already know: she's significant.\"\n\"And dangerous,\" Kael said, his voice low but steady. \"We can't ignore that.\"\nSophia bristled. \"You think I'll turn on you?\"\nKael met her eyes, and his expression softened. \"No. But the prophecy states what it says. We must be prepared for all possibilities.\"\nTharros rested a hand on Sophia's shoulder, his touch anchoring. \"We won't let this separate us. Sophia is not the threat; rather, the Leviathan is. If anything, this makes it clearer: we must ensure that she becomes Aquaria's savior.\"\nSophia's chest heaved with a combination of thankfulness and worry. \"What if I can't?\" What happens if the prophecy's warnings come true?\nTharros' voice was steady and unwavering. \"Then we'll stop it. Together.\"\nThe following days were a blur of preparation. The prophecy loomed over them like a storm cloud, its consequences impossible to ignore. Sophia pushed herself harder than ever during her training, aiming to master her skills. Kael's workouts became fiercer, and Arin's instruction delved deeper into the subtleties of magic.\nOne evening, as they exercised in the sanctuary, Sophia paused, her breathing hard. \"Why do you think the prophecy is so vague?\" she inquired, her tone tinted with annoyance.\nArin tilted her head, contemplating the question. \"Prophecies are never clear. They're supposed to guide, not dictate. The future is not set in stone. It is shaped by our decisions.\nSophia nodded slowly, her words echoing. \"Then we have to make the right ones.\"\nLate one night, Sophia found herself alone in the coral tower. The tome sat on the pedestal, its pages glimmering faintly in the low light. She approached it cautiously, her fingers caressing the edges.\nThe words appeared to pulsate, drawing her in. As she read, an odd emotion came over her. Images flew through her mind: fire and water colliding, shadows devouring light, and a voice echoing across the mayhem.\nChoose wisely, or everything will be lost.\nSophia staggered back, breathing in short gasps. The vision faded away, but the voice remained, a disturbing reminder of the stakes. She clutched the pedestal, her resolve tightening.\n\"I won't let this happen,\" she said quietly. \"I will battle for Aquaria. \"For all of us.\"\nWhen she explained the vision to Tharros, Kael, and Arin, their reactions were a combination of concern and determination.\n\"The prophecy's warnings are becoming clearer,\" Tharros stated, his voice husky. \"We must be alert. \"Every decision counts.\"\nKael nodded. \"Then we concentrate on what we can control.\" Strengthen our forces. Prepare for the Leviathan.\nArin's focus remained on Sophia. \"And make sure you're prepared. Whatever occurs, you are the key.\"\nSophia met their gaze, her dread alleviated by their encouragement. She wasn't alone in her fight, which gave her confidence. But as the days passed, the prophecy weighed heavily on her shoulders.\nThe Leviathan stirred in the ocean's lowest depths. It felt the prophecy's ripples, as Sophia's strength awoke. A loud, rumbling laugh resonated across the abyss.\nAllow them to prepare. Their hope will become their undoing.\nIts shadows extended farther, devouring everything in their path. The final confrontation loomed, and Aquaria's fate was in the balance.\nThe Leviathan’s Warning\nThe hallways of the coral castle were peaceful but for the soothing buzz of the ocean currents outside. Sophia walked along the quiet corridors, her mind burdened with the weight of the prophecy. She had trained relentlessly, endured Kael's punishing drills, and absorbed Arin's magical lessons, yet the shadow of uncertainty lingered.\nSeeking solace, she went to the observatory, a massive chamber adorned with crystalline windows that provided a panoramic view of the sea. Bioluminescent critters flew by, their glow feeble against the vast blue horizon. Sophia settled into a cushioned alcove, closed her eyes and allowing the water's steady pulse calm her strained nerves.\nMoments of peace were uncommon, so she relished this one. However, the tranquility did not endure. A abrupt chill descended upon the room, the warmth of the water replaced by an eerie cold. Sophia's eyes sprung wide, and her breath caught when the vision outside darkened. The bioluminescent animals faded, leaving only shadows swirling behind the glass.\nAnd suddenly it appeared.\nA gigantic shape emerged from the darkness, its bright eyes fixed on her. The Leviathan. Its presence filled the chamber despite the fact that it remained outside. Its deep, resonant voice rang in her mind.\n\"Foolish child,\" it growled. \"Do you think you can defy me?\" That your flimsy ties can prevent what is unavoidable?\nSophia stood, her legs shaky but her determination unwavering. \"You don't scare me,\" she murmured as her voice faltered.\nThe Leviathan chuckled, a low, rumbling sound that caused ripples in the sea. \"Oh, you should be terrified. Your power belongs to me. You are nothing without it, and in the end, you will submit to me. \"They all will.\"\nSophia tightened her fists, anger rising in her chest. \"I will not kowtow to you. Aquaria will not fall. We will stop you.\"\nThe creature's eyes narrowed, and its gaze was penetrating. \"Brave words for someone so weak. But bravery will not save you. \"The darkness inside you is mine, and it will consume you.\"\nThe shadows around it surged, pressing on the glass as if to test its durability. Sophia took a step back, breathing in short gasps. The Leviathan's voice shifted to a sarcastic tone.\n\"You have seen the prophecy. You know the truth. You're a tool, a conduit for my power. Embrace it, and I may still spare you.\"\nSophia shook her head, and her voice broke. \"You are wrong. I am more than that. \"I will fight you with everything I have.\"\nThe Leviathan's laughter echoed once more, cold and hollow. \"We'll see, little one. But remember this: no matter how bright your light is, the darkness will always be greater.\"\nWith that, the shadows faded and the Leviathan vanished, leaving the observatory in eerie calm. Sophia fell back into the alcove, her body shivering. The experience left her shaken, with the words echoing in her mind.\nSophia discovered Tharros in the battle room, reading over maps beside Kael. The dragon king looked up as she arrived, his acute eyes catching her pale appearance.\n\"What happened?\" he questioned, moving to face her.\nSophia hesitated, looking at Kael. Tharros nodded at the warrior. \"Leave us.\"\nKael paused, his gaze lingering on Sophia, but he complied and left without saying anything. Once they were alone, Tharros motioned for her to sit.\n\"Tell me everything,\" he asked, his voice calm yet demanding.\nSophia described the image, her words flowing out in a hurry. She detailed the Leviathan's taunting, claim to her authority, and terrifying warning. Tharros remained silent when she finished, his countenance opaque.\n\"Do you believe it?\" he inquired last.\nSophia paused. \"I do not want to. But what if it's correct? \"What if I am not strong enough?\"\nTharros knelt before her, his golden gaze fixed on hers. \"Listen to me, Sophia. The Leviathan is a master manipulator. It lives on dread and mistrust. That is how it wins. But you're stronger than you realize. Your strength does not derive from the Leviathan's power. \"It comes from here.\"\nHe put a palm on her heart, his touch warm and steady. \"From your boldness and kindness. That's what sets you apart. That is what renders you hazardous to it.\nSophia's eyes welled with tears, but she blinked them away. \"What if it's not enough?\"\nTharros grinned slightly. \"Then we will stand with you. You are not alone in this fight. \"Remember that.\"\nHis words washed over her like a calming tide, soothing the tempest within her. She nodded, her resolve strengthened. Thank you, Tharros. \"I needed that.\"\nHe rose, his massive figure towering over her, but exuding confidence. \"Rest tonight. Tomorrow, we will continue the fight.\"\nThat night, Sophia stood on the balcony outside her chamber, gazing out at the great ocean. The Leviathan's words remained, but Tharros' comfort rang out louder. She clutched the rails firmly.\n\"You won't win,\" she said quietly into the darkness. \"Not while I still stand.\"\nBioluminescent lights flashed through the water below, serving as a reminder of the life she fought to save. The Leviathan's shadow loomed, but so did her determination. The war had not ended, and she was not giving up.\nThe following morning brought an intensity to the palace that Sophia had not experienced before. She joined Kael on the training fields, her body exhausted but her spirit unwavering. Kael's workouts were harsh, with each hit of their swords serving as a reminder of the upcoming battle.\n\"Focus,\" Kael said, as Sophia faltered. \"The Leviathan won't wait for you to regain your footing.\"\nSophia gritted her teeth, regained her balance, and countered his next attempt. Sweat ran down her face, but she refused to give up. Each crash of their blades sent shockwaves through the water, and their sparring drew a small crowd.\n\"Better,\" Kael remarked with grudging approval. \"But you need to be faster.\"\nSophia nodded and adjusted her stance. Her thoughts replayed Tharros' words, using them as motivation to strive beyond her boundaries. She refused to let the Leviathan's taunts define her.\nLater, she joined Arin in the sanctum, where the sea witch's lessons were as difficult as ever. Arin's acute sight missed nothing as she pushed Sophia to improve her control over hydrokinesis. The water accepted Sophia's directions more easily now, but Arin desired perfection.\n\"Again,\" Arin stated, her tone leaving no space for debate. \"Preciseness important. \"If you lose focus for even a moment, it could cost you everything.\"\nSophia inhaled deeply, concentrating as she adjusted the currents surrounding her. The water formed intricate shapes and flowed with a grace that had not been seen before. Arin nodded, revealing a rare smile on her lips.\n\"You're getting there,\" she replied. \"But keep in mind that the Leviathan's powers will put you to the test in ways that I cannot reproduce. Be prepared for that.\nSophia returned Arin's look, her determination firm. \"I will be.\"\nSophia returned to the observatory that evening, her memories of the Leviathan's visit still fresh. She looked out at the darkening waves, her reflection weak on the glass.\n\"You're not winning,\" she said quietly, her voice firm despite the lingering anxiety. \"Not this time.\"\nTharros appeared behind her, his presence bringing comfort. \"You're stronger than you realize, Sophia. The Leviathan senses it. That's why it's attempting to break you.\nShe turned to him, her face determined. \"It won't succeed.\"\nTharros smiled, his trust in her unshakeable. \"No, it won't.\"\nThe Leviathan moved in the ocean's depths. Its laughter boomed across the abyss, a frightening foreshadowing of what was to follow.\nSoon, small one. Soon.\nThe Edge of Unity\nThe council room was strangely silent as the last murmurs of disagreement faded into the shadows. Sophia could still feel Varyon's glare as she left the room, with Kael by her side. The chilly air outdoors contrasted sharply with the boiling anxiety inside.\n\"He'll come around,\" Kael interrupted the silence, his voice low but encouraging.\nSophia's gaze remained riveted on the shimmering paths ahead. \"Will he?\" Will he be the one to pull us apart?\nKael paused, his hand softly holding her wrist. \"No one will rip us apart. Not him; not the Leviathan.\" His demeanor was firm, but the flicker of hesitation in his eyes revealed his own reservations.\nSophia nodded, but her chest felt heavy. \"We have to prepare. If we wait for unity to occur on its own, we will lose everything.\"\nKael twisted his lips into a slight smile. \"Then let's not wait.\"\nAquaria's training grounds were filled with vitality. Warriors moved in synchronous rhythms, their weapons glittering beneath the bioluminescent spheres that hung overhead. Sophia stood at the edge, her hands gripping the hilt of a borrowed blade. Kael's armor gleamed beside her, grabbing her attention.\n\"Again,\" he said, stepping back as she took position. Sweat stuck to her brow, but she remained determined. Each attack and parry felt like a minor win, but the warriors watching from the sidelines were unimpressed.\n\"They won't respect you until they see what you're capable of,\" Kael murmured softly, so only she could hear. \"Show them.\"\nSophia nodded, despite her frustration. She moved forward, locking eyes with one of the warriors, a tall, imposing man with scars on his arms. \"Let's spar.\"\nThe warrior hesitated, his attention shifting to Kael before returning to her. He nodded and lifted his trident. The duel started. Sophia's moves were meticulous, and her training with Kael showed in every stroke and evasion. But the warrior was faster, stronger, and unstoppable.\nShe tripped, almost escaping a punch that would have knocked her sprawling. The throng murmured, and a familiar sense of unease went over her. But then she noticed Kael, his gaze solid and his faith in her unshaken.\nSophia took a deep breath and reached within herself. Water from the adjoining pool rushed around her, enveloping her sword in a shimmering mist. She moved with renewed precision, her attacks forcing the warrior backward. The final strike sent his trident skittering across the ground, and the crowd fell silent.\nThe warrior picked himself up, his face inscrutable. He then took a step back, bowing deeply. The quiet was broken with applause. Sophia's chest clenched, but this time with relief.\nKael's hand touched hers as he leaned closer. \"I told you.\"\nMeanwhile, Tharros' golden eyes surveyed the map in front of him. The boundaries of other kingdoms were outlined in crimson, signaling the mounting threat of the Leviathan's contamination. Envoys from many kingdoms had arrived, their appeals for assistance resounding through the halls.\n\"They're desperate,\" Arin murmured, entering the chamber. Her robes shimmered with mild magical energy, and her expression was as sharp as ever.\nTharros' jaws constricted. \"Desperation creates hazardous allies. We cannot afford betrayal.\n\"And yet,\" Arin responded, \"we can't fight this war alone.\"\nTharros looked to her, his face softening slightly. \"Have the enchantments been completed?\"\nArin nodded. \"The palace was reinforced. Any effort to breach it will result in enough force to make even the Leviathan recoil. However, this is only a temporary solution. The actual fight will not be waged here.\"",

        "content": "Tharros' expression clouded as he trailed a finger across the map's center, where the abyssal trenches lay. \"No. It will be fought at the source.\"\nSophia sat on the balcony that evening, with the city lights producing gentle reflections on the ocean's surface. She felt the weight of the day-the trust she'd gained and the relationships she was forming. The shadow of Varyon's dissent persisted.\nKael joined her, his armor changed by modest clothing, but his presence remained dominating. \"You did well today.\"\nSophia's lips twitched into a little smile. \"It's just a start.\"\nKael's expression softened as he sat next to her. \"A start is all we need.\"\nArin's presence broke their moment, leaving her countenance unclear. \"The Leviathan is stirring.\"\nSophia felt her heart skip a beat. \"How do you know?\"\nArin paused, her attention shifting to Kael before settling on Sophia. \"The enchantments have begun to weaken. Its corruption is spreading faster than we expected.\nKael stood, his jaw hardening. \"Then we don't have time to waste.\"\nSophia stood, her resolve hardened. \"What do we do?\"\nArin moved closer, her voice firm but solemn. \"We gather our forces. We prepare for battle. And we confront the Leviathan before it's too late.\"\nVaryon stood in a subterranean chamber below the palace, his hands resting on an old item. The whispers of disagreement that had previously tormented his mind now appeared louder and more urgent.\n\"They trust her too much,\" he murmured, his tone harsh. \"She'll be the end of us.\"\nThe relic pulsed with a faint, malicious glow, as if reacting to his distress. Varyon's face hardened. \"If no one else will act, then I will.\"\nAbove, far beyond the castle walls, the Leviathan stirred. Its laughter rang down the abyss, a terrible precursor to the chaos that would ensue.\nSophia stood on the training fields once more, with Kael, Tharros, and Arin by her side. The warriors of Aquaria gathered before them, their weapons ready and their faces determined.\n\"Today, we stand as one,\" Tharros announced, his voice echoing throughout the crowd. \"Not as kingdoms divided, but as a united force against a common enemy.\"\nSophia's gaze ran across the faces before her. Some still had doubts, but she sensed something greater underlying them: hope. She moved forward, her voice steady. \"We battle not only for Aquaria, but for everything we cherish. Together, we can overcome Leviathan.\"\nThe warriors raised their swords in a unison shout, which echoed throughout the city. But while the cheers echoed, Sophia's attention was drawn to the horizon, where the ocean's edge met the abyss.\nThe Leviathan's corruption loomed, and she knew in her heart that their biggest battle was still ahead.\nFar below, the Leviathan's laughter grew louder, its dark tendrils spreading through the water. Varyon's treason began in the darkness of Aquaria.\nThe war had started.\nA New Resolve\nSophia stood on the edge of the balcony, overlooking the city, and the roar of Aquaria's troops resonated in her mind. The glow of the bioluminescent coral illuminated the wide expanse of the kingdom, throwing a soothing light on the gathering armies below. It was stunning, but tonight, the beauty acted as a stark contrast to the approaching darkness.\nTharros approached, his golden eyes full of pride and fear. \"They are prepared to battle, yet fear still lingers. \"You felt it, didn't you?\"\nSophia turned with a steady stare. \"Yes. However, fear can be used to your advantage rather than against you. It keeps us focused and reminds us what's at stake.\"\nHe nodded, his lips forming a narrow line. \"And you?\" \"Are you ready?\"\nShe paused. The weight of her duty hung heavily on her shoulders, yet behind it, a glint of determination burned brightly. \"I have to be.\"\nThe council hall was alive with murmuring as leaders from all over Aquaria gathered. Kael stood near the entryway, his posture tight, his palm resting on the hilt of his blade. Arin leaned against a coral pillar, her black eyes surveying the surroundings. Sophia entered with Tharros, and the throng fell silent.\n\"Friends,\" Tharros said, his deep voice echoing. \"We stand on the verge of a war that will shape our destiny. The Leviathan's corruption is spreading faster than we anticipated, and we must act quickly.\nKael moved forward, his presence commanding. \"This is more than just a fight for Aquaria.\" This is a war for every soul affected by the sea. If we fail here, not only will the darkness swallow our dominion, but also the globe above.\"\nMurmurs of agreement echoed across the room, but tension was obvious. Sophia made a step forward, speaking steadily and clearly. \"I understand that many of you doubt me. I understand your anxieties. I've felt them, too. But fear doesn't define us. What defines us is how we respond to it.\"\nSome looked at her skeptically, while others were hopeful. She pressed on, her words growing stronger. \"We're stronger together. Tharros, Kael, Arin, and I are proof of that. Our link is more than simply power; it is also a vow to each of you. Together, we can push back the darkness. Together, we can win.\nThe chamber exploded with cheers, the atmosphere transforming from apprehension to determination. Tharros placed a hand on her shoulder, a rare grin softening his harsh features. \"You've given them hope.\"\nSophia matched his look, her own confidence returning. \"Now we just have to make sure we don't waste it.\"\nPreparations moved quickly. Warriors practiced diligently, their movements perfect and deadly. Enchantments fortified the palace walls, with luminous runes creating complex patterns on the coral. Sophia worked with Kael and Arin in the city center to fine-tune their methods, paying close attention to every aspect.\n\"We'll need to draw it out,\" Arin remarked, tracing a map with her finger. \"The Leviathan is excessively powerful in its domain. If we can bring it closer to the surface, we will have an edge.\"\nKael scowled, his brow furrowed. \"And risk exposing the city?\" \"That is a risk we cannot afford.\"\nSophia watched them, her thoughts racing. She could sense the Leviathan's strength, a black thread tugging at the borders of her mind. \"What if we're the bait?\"\nBoth Kael and Arin looked at her, their expressions a mix of surprise and worry. \"Sophia,\" Kael said, his voice stern, \"that's too dangerous.\"\n\"It's already drawn to us,\" she replied. \"To me. We use it. If it believes it can take us out before we are ready, it may make a mistake.\nArin tilted her head, contemplating. \"It's hazardous, but she's not mistaken. The Leviathan's arrogance could be its undoing.\nKael's jaw tensed, but he simply nodded. \"If we do this, we do so carefully. \"One mistake, and we're done.\"\nSophia was alone on the training grounds the night before their departure. The stars above shone weakly through the ocean's surface, a reminder of the world she had left behind.\n\"Can't sleep?\" Tharros' voice pierced the silence. He approached, his presence as strong as ever.\nSophia shakes her head. \"Too much on my mind.\"\nHe nodded while standing behind her. \"The burden of leadership is never light. \"But you carry it well.\"\nShe looked at him, a tiny smile on her lips. \"Coming from you, that means something.\"\nFor a minute, they stood silently, their unsaid tie filling the area. Finally, Tharros spoke again. \"You have changed since you arrived here. You're stronger, more confident in yourself. Whatever happens tomorrow, know that I am proud of you.\nHer chest constricted at his words, a mixture of thankfulness and determination welling up within her. Thank you. \"For everything.\"\nTharros reached out and brushed her hand. It was a simple gesture, but it spoke volumes.\nAt dawn, the city gathered to bid them goodbye. Sophia was at the forefront, flanked by Tharros, Kael, and Arin. The warriors lined the paths, their weapons sparkling, their faces determined.\nSophia went forward, her voice resonating throughout the gathering. \"Today, we begin a journey to confront the evil that threatens us all. But understand this: we are not just battling for survival. We are battling for the future. A future in which our children can thrive, our cities can sparkle, and hope can grow.\nThe crowd burst into shouts, their voices rising like a wave. Sophia looked at her companions, a spark of determination in her eyes. \"Let's end this.\"\nThey set forth, the route ahead unclear but full of purpose. As they dropped, the seas became colder and darker. The Leviathan's stronghold loomed in the horizon, a dark mass throbbing with malicious energy.\nSophia's heart pounded, but she held onto the relationship she had with Tharros, Kael, and Arin. It was more than simply power; it was hope, a beacon of light in the midst of darkness.\nFar above, in the metropolis they'd left behind, whispers of discontent resurfaced. Varyon remained in the shadows, his look stern. The relic in his hands shone slightly, its power pouring into the atmosphere.\n\"They think they can win,\" he whispered, his tone chilly. \"But they've already lost.\"\nThe artifact pulsed, causing a dark energy crack to tear open the chamber. Varyon's lips twisted into a vicious sneer as he withdrew into the shadows, the repercussions of his betrayal echoing throughout the city.\nThe Leviathan stirred deep within the abyss, its laughter echoing throughout. It felt them approaching, and its victim walked freely into its realm.\n\"Come,\" it said, its voice cold with promise. \"Let us see if your hope can withstand despair.\"\nThe voyage to the Leviathan's fortress had begun, and the last fight was approaching. But the issue remained: would togetherness be sufficient to overcome the darkness, or would the shadows claim them all?\nTraining and Growth\nThe plunge into the Leviathan's shadowy depths had begun, but the gang realized they weren't prepared. Every step farther into the abyss necessitated accuracy, strength, and a unity greater than any one of them could muster. Sophia felt it acutely: the balance between confidence and fear, hope and despair. Her abilities were developing, but she couldn't shake the idea that they wouldn't be enough.\nKael wasted no time in clearing her doubts.\n\"You're holding back,\" he replied with a harsh tone. The training grounds, cut from living coral, vibrated with electricity as he circled her. His trident sparkled in the pale glimmer of Aquaria's orbs. \"Again.\"\nSophia's arms hurt from the constant repetition, but she clenched her teeth and tightened her grasp on the blade. She lunged, moving quickly but predictably. Kael blocked with ease, and his comeback was rapid and precise. The blade flew from her grasp, clattering to the ground.\n\"Stop thinking like a scientist,\" Kael demanded. \"It's not about reasoning. \"It is instinct.\"\nSophia gazed at him, her chest heaving. \"Do you think I don't know that? \"I'm trying.\"\n\"Trying isn't enough,\" he murmured, moving closer. His voice softened, but his intensity remained. \"You are stronger than this. I see it. You simply have to trust yourself.\"\nSomething about his remarks struck a chord. Sophia nodded and retrieved the sword. This time, she let go of meticulous planning and overthinking. When Kael moved, she reacted-not precisely, but purposefully. The crash of their guns reverberated throughout the chamber, and for the first time, she did not feel outmatched.\nLater that day, Arin led Sophia to an old ritual place deep in Aquaria's center. The air here was different, filled with energy that hummed against her skin. Runes engraved into the coral gleamed softly and pulsed in time with the currents.\n\"This is where our magic was born,\" Arin murmured, her voice solemn. \"These practices will help you realize your greatest potential. But it is not easy. \"Magic requires both surrender and control.\"\nSophia watched Arin kneel and weave delicate designs in the water. The currents responded, spinning into patterns beyond description.\n\"Now you try,\" Arin responded, stepping back.\nSophia hesitated, but mirrored the moves. Her power sparked to life, and the water bent to her will. Yet it seemed raw and unsteady. The shapes collapsed before they could fully develop.\nArin's look was patient. \"You are battling it. Magic is more than just power; it is a communication. Listen to it.\nSophia closed her eyes and reached beyond the commotion in her head. She felt the currents as partners in creation, rather than tools to be commanded. This time, the forms remained-a shimmering spiral of water that whirled in the low light.\nArin smiled faintly but approvingly. \"Better. Now, let's go even further.\"\nSophia's training became more intense as the days and weeks passed. Kael's intense drills sharpened her reflexes, while Arin's instruction revealed deeper depths of her power. Tharros remained vigilant throughout, his presence serving as a firm anchor. His silence frequently spoke louder than words, and his golden eyes reflected a trust she didn't think she deserved.\nOne nightfall, Tharros joined her at the brink of a sparkling pool. The water's surface rippled with mild heat, indicating the remains of his fire.\n\"Show me what you've learned,\" he asked.\nSophia nodded and stepped forward. She summoned the water and used hydrokinesis to form a spherical. Then she stared at him. \"Your turn.\"\nTharros raised his hand, and flames flickered to life. He directed them to the sphere, and Sophia braced herself. The fire struck, and the water resisted for a little period. The elements then merged, as if remembering their common tie. The sphere sparkled with great heat, as a superheated current flowed within.\nSophia's breath caught. \"We did it.\"\nTharros' smile was rare, but sincere. \"No. You did it. I just followed your direction.\"\nSophia's confidence grew as a result of the breakthrough, but it also added to her burden. The warriors stared at her with increasing admiration, their doubts replaced by hope. However, that hope seemed fragile, and the weight of their expectations pressed against her.\n\"You're carrying too much,\" Kael commented one night while walking across the city. \"You don't have to bear it alone.\"\nSophia looked at him. \"It does not feel like I have a choice. \"If I fail...\"\n\"If you fail, we fail together,\" he interjected, his tone harsh. \"This is not just your fight, Sophia. \"Remember that.\"\nHis comments stuck with her, reminding her that her strength came not just from within, but also from others who supported her.\nTheir last training session was unlike any others. Tharros, Kael, and Arin joined her in the ritual chamber, and their combined energy filled the room. They practiced combining their talents, each link more flawless than the last.\nSophia summoned the water, and Kael's warrior magic strengthened it, forming a living barrier. Arin's enchantments flowed through the currents, adding layers of complexity. Finally, Tharros' fire heated it to a boil, the combined force emitting destructive power.\nWhen they stopped, the chamber was silent, the air dense with the residue of their exertion. Sophia stared at each of them, her chest tight with emotion.\n\"We're ready,\" she stated, her voice firm.\nTharros moved closer, his eyes unflinching. \"Almost. One last test remains.\"\nSophia furrowed her brow. \"What test?\"\nKael and Arin exchanged looks, their emotions grim.\n\"The Leviathan will test not just our strength but our unity,\" Arin told us. \"It will exploit every weakness, every fear.\"\nTharros's voice was forceful. \"We must tackle this together. Without hesitation. \"No doubt.\"\nSophia couldn't fall asleep that night. She strolled to the edge of the castle, where the waves stretched into darkness. Her reflection peered back at her, the faint glow of her power illuminating her face.\n\"Are you afraid?\"\nShe turned to see Arin, her figure illuminated by the city's dim light. Sophia nodded. \"Terrified.\"\nArin's expression softened. \"Good. Fear indicates that you care. Caring provides us strength.\nSophia attempted a slight smile. \"You're good at this, you know.\"\nArin shrugged. \"I've practiced. But don't tell anybody. \"It will harm my reputation.\"\nSophia felt a sliver of serenity for the first time in days after the slight humor helped to relieve the strain.\nThe next morning, they assembled on the city's outskirts. The warriors stood ready, their swords sparkling and their determination unflinching. Sophia joined Tharros, Kael, and Arin in the front, her heart racing.\nTharros lifted his voice to address the audience. \"Today, we move together. We battle not only for Aquaria, but for the future of our planet. Stand tall, strong, and remember that together, we are unstoppable.\"\nThe cheers were thunderous, and the enthusiasm was tangible. However, as they turned toward the abyss, a shadow appeared in the distance. The Leviathan's presence was clear, and its power foreshadowed the upcoming fight.\nSophia's grip on her blade tightened, and her resolve strengthened. This was it. The final test awaited, and she was prepared to face it-along with those who believed in her.\nThe Leviathan stirred in the depths, its laughing leaving an eerie echo.\n\"Come,\" it whispered. \"Show me your strength.\"\nKael’s Mission\nThe Leviathan's menacing shadow extended deeper into the abyss, foreshadowing the impending confrontation. The unified forces of Aquaria stayed firm, yet fissures remained beneath the surface. One such split was the partnership with the Shark Clans, a volatile organization with significant power in the oceans. Without their assistance, the odds against the Leviathan would tip dangerously.\nKael volunteered for the assignment. Nobody else could bridge the divide between Aquaria and the feuding clans. He was particularly qualified for the task, which required both strength and diplomacy.\nKael stood at the city's edge, ready to leave. Sophia approached with a mixture of concern and resolve.\n\"You're sure about this?\" she said, her voice quiet but steady.\nKael tightened the straps of his armor, the weight of responsibility resting on his shoulders. \"It needs to be me. \"They refuse to listen to anyone else.\"\n\"They might not listen to you either,\" she added, getting closer. \"Take care. The Shark Clans aren't known for being patient.\nHe smirked, but his eyes were serious. \"Nor am I. That might work to our advantage.\"\nSophia placed a hand on his arm to ground him for a while. \"Please come back. \"We need you.\"\nKael nodded, his countenance softened. \"I will be back. Promise.\"\nThe voyage to the Shark Clan's land was dangerous. The waves darkened as Kael walked away from Aquaria, the bioluminescent brilliance of his home dwindling behind him. Predators frequented these depths, moving quickly and silently. Nonetheless, Kael proceeded with purpose, his senses keen and his blade ready.\nWhen he approached the limits of the Shark Clans' land, he was met with hostility. A squad of warriors emerged from the darkness, their enormous figures filled with menace. Their captain, a scarred and intimidating figure, blocked Kael's route.\n\"State your business,\" the leader yelled, his voice low and gruff.\nKael stood erect and met the warrior's stare without flinching. \"I am coming to speak with your elders. The Leviathan threatens everyone. We have to stand together.\"\nThe warrior sneered, revealing rows of sharp teeth. \"Why should we trust you, Prince of Aquaria?\" Your type has always looked down upon us.\"\nKael's jaw tensed, but his voice remained steady. \"I am not here to bring up past grudges. I am come to preserve our earth. Let me speak with your leaders.\nFor a brief while, it appeared that the warriors might resist. With a harsh nod, the leader motioned for Kael to follow.\nThe Shark Clans' settlement was in sharp contrast to Aquaria's brilliant splendor. Black coral and jagged stone were used to carve the structures, which were tough and functional. The air was thick with tension, and the residents' eyes followed Kael with distrust.\nHe was escorted to a central chamber, where the Shark Clan leaders were waiting. The area was poorly lighted, with the faint glow of phosphorescent algae throwing spooky shadows against the walls. The elders, a mix of seasoned warriors and astute strategists, sat in a semi-circle, their gazes piercing and unwavering.\n\"Speak,\" one of them said, a female elder with a grinding stone's voice. \"Why should we ally with Aquaria?\"\nKael stepped forward, his demeanor confident yet courteous. \"The Leviathan's corruption spreads quicker by the day. It will not stop at Aquaria. Your territories will fall just as assuredly as ours if we do not band together.\"\nAn elder with one lost eye leaned forward, his tone doubtful. \"And what guarantee do we have that Aquaria won't betray us once the Leviathan is dealt with?\"\nKael's voice hardened. \"War comes with no guarantees. But I can assure you this: without unity, we will all perish. The Leviathan is unconcerned about our rivalries. \"It will consume us all.\"\nThe room grew hushed, the weight of his words lingering in the air. Finally, the scarred commander who had accompanied Kael spoke.\n\"We have heard your words, but they are cheap. Prince, show us your strength and prove that you are worth following.\nKael's fingers moved to his blade, his face unyielding. \"Name your challenge.\"\nThe arena was a harsh circle of jagged rock, its edges crowded with enthusiastic onlookers. As his opponent approached, Kael stood in the center, gripping his sword tightly. The competitor was enormous, even by Shark Clan standards, with muscles rippling beneath his scarred skin.\nThe struggle was savage. The challenger attacked with passion, delivering powerful and unrelenting attacks. Kael moved precisely, guided by his expertise and experience. He avoided, countered, and struck, each action premeditated.\nAs the fight heated up, the crowd erupted in rage. Blood coated the water, as fatigue began to set in. But Kael refused to budge. With a final, conclusive stroke, he disarmed his opponent, sending his weapon clattering to the ground.\nThe arena became silent, leaving the watchers shocked. Then, one by one, they began cheering. The elders observed with approbation, their initial distrust replaced by cautious respect.\nFollowing the fight, Kael stood before the elders once more.\n\"You've proven your strength,\" stated the female elder. \"However, strength alone will not win this fight. We will give our forces, but understand that our commitment is conditional. Any indication of disloyalty, and we will turn against you.\"\nKael nodded. \"Understood. \"Thank you.\"\nThe meeting ended, and Kael began his trek back to Aquaria. The coalition was far from strong, but it was a start. Yet, as he swam through the black waters, he felt a gnawing unease in his chest. The Shark Clans were unpredictable, with their motivations unclear. He couldn't avoid the notion that their support was contingent on certain conditions.\nWhen Kael returned to Aquaria, his companions' relief was evident. Sophia was the first to greet him, examining him for any injuries.\n\"You're back,\" she replied, her tone tinged with relief and censure.\nHe smirked, but tiredness weighed heavily on him. \"Didn't I promise?\"\nTharros approached, his golden eyes evaluating. \"How did it go?\"\nKael's expression became serious. \"We have their support, but it is tenuous. They will fight alongside us, but I do not trust their motives.\"\nArin's voice was harsh. \"The Shark Clans have always had their own agenda. We will need to keep a tight eye on them.\"\nSophia placed her hand on Kael's arm, anchoring him. \"You did exactly what we needed. That is what matters.\nHe nodded, but the discomfort stayed. \"Let's hope it's enough.\"\nThe monster stirred deep within the Leviathan's territory. It felt the shifting alliances and mounting resistance. Its laughter resonated through the depths, a terrifying sound that foreshadowed chaos.\n\"Let them come,\" it said softly, its voice a black caress. \"They will kneel before the end.\"\nReturning to Fragile Ties\nKael's return to Aquaria was not the joyous homecoming he had expected. The dark seas surrounding the city were alive with anxiety, a hushed tension that clung to every coral spire and bioluminescent channel. As he approached the gates, the Shark Clans' escort parted ways, with Garrek, their chief, giving a brief nod before vanishing into the depths. The deal had been reached, but it felt more like a ceasefire with a serpent waiting to strike than an alliance.\nKael walked into the council chamber, his boots ringing against the smooth stone floor. The elders had already assembled, their looks filled with distrust. Tharros stood at the front of the room, his commanding presence casting a long shadow over the proceedings. Sophia and Arin waited on the outskirts of the crowd, their opposing energies-one analytical, the other incomprehensible-anchoring him amongst the tempest of doubt.\n\"The Shark Clans have agreed to join us,\" Kael said, his voice firm despite their intense glances. \"They will fight alongside Aquaria against the Leviathan.\"\nA murmur sounded throughout the council. One of the seniors, Coren, a wiry man with piercing eyes, leaned forward. \"And what price have we paid for this... alliance?\"\nKael's jaws constricted. \"The Shark Clans demand acknowledgment. Their warriors will fight for their own banner, not ours. \"They want respect, not submission.\"\nCoren curved his lips into a faint smile. \"Respect? Or dominance? \"How long until they turn their blades on us?\"\n\"Enough.\" Tharros' voice broke through the din and silenced the room. His golden eyes were riveted on Coren, unwavering. \"We need allies. The Leviathan's shadow expands, and our disagreements only help its cause.\"\nDespite Tharros' imposing presence, anxiety remained. Kael felt the weight of their distrust like a dagger on his back. He'd fought innumerable battles, but this-standing in front of his own people, their trust in him shaken-was a wound he couldn't readily heal.\nAs the council withdrew, Sophia approached, her warm look cutting through Kael's frustration. \"They'll come around,\" she murmured, her voice soft but firm. \"You've done something remarkable.\"\nKael pulled his lips into a nasty grimace. \"Being remarkable does not imply trustworthiness. They regard me as a warrior, not a diplomat. Perhaps they are right.\"\n\"Diplomacy isn't about being perfect,\" Sophia said. \"It's about perseverance. Did you convince the Shark Clans? \"That is a start.\"\nArin joined them, her face unreadable. \"She's right,\" the sea witch said, her tone dry and amused. \"However, tenacity alone will not win this fight. The council's dissent serves as a tool, Kael. Use it to hone your position, not weaken your commitment.\"\nKael's attention shifted between them. One offered reassurance, while the other challenged. He found himself relying on them, their comments creating a tenuous thread of determination within him.\nLater that evening, Kael stood atop one of Aquaria's tallest structures, with the city's bioluminescent glow spread beneath him like a living map. Tharros joined him, his towering presence providing quiet reassurance.\n\"You did well today,\" Tharros announced, breaking the silence.\nKael's laugh was bitter. \"'Well'? They questioned every word I said. Some may regard me as a traitor for introducing the Shark Clans into our waters.\"\nTharros placed his hand on Kael's shoulder, the weight of which grounded him. \"Leadership is not about obtaining unanimous acceptance. It is about making difficult decisions and sticking by them. You've done it. Now show them the power of your conviction.\"\nKael nodded, but the ache in his chest persisted. As Tharros left, leaving Kael alone in the solitude, his thoughts turned inward. He had fought demons, but the struggle within his own heart-doubt and dread of failure-was an adversary he could not easily defeat.\nMeanwhile, Sophia traversed the Coral Tower's intricate hallways, filled with whispers of old power. She had come looking for Arin, but the sea witch was nowhere to be found. Instead, she focused on a faint glimmer radiating from a sculpted niche. Curiosity drew her in, and she discovered an old tome, its pages faded yet throbbing with an unusual energy.\nThe writing was written in a language she couldn't fully understand, but several fragmented phrases stuck out: The Four-Member Union. The Abyssal Shadow. An unbroken bond.\nA cold ran down her spine. The words felt like echoes of a truth she wasn't quite ready to confront. She clutched the book and determined to share it with Arin and the others. Whatever mysteries it contained, she recognized them as pieces of a puzzle that could not be overlooked.\nLater that night, Kael found himself on the outskirts of the training fields, the sound of sparring troops ringing faintly in the distance. His mind was racing, replaying the elders' words over and over. A person emerged from the shadows-Arin. Her black eyes reflected the dim illumination from Aquaria's lights.\n\"Brooding doesn't suit you, Kael,\" she murmured, her voice soft and seductive.\nHe turned to her, an irritated expression on his face. \"I'm not brooding.\"\n\"Then what would you call this?\" She motioned vaguely at him, her face unreadable. \"You've done the hard part, yet you're standing here, doubting yourself.\"\n\"You think I don't see the fractures?\" He shot back with a sharp tone. \"The council is divided, the Shark Clans are barely restrained, and now we have whispers of dissent within our own ranks.\"\nArin tilted her head, her eyes piercing. \"Fractures can be repaired. But not if you keep staring at them, hoping they'll mend themselves.",

        "content": "Kael inhaled softly, letting her words sink in. Arin's bluntness was both aggravating and reassuring, a reminder that, while the route ahead was difficult, it was not impossible.\nA darker current swirled within Aquaria's outer limits. The Leviathan's influence became stronger, with its corruption appearing in grotesque monsters that prowled the darkness. And one senior lingered within the council chambers, his eyes glittering with something far more frightening than disagreement.\nKael's homecoming resulted in an alliance, but it also revealed latent divisions within Aquaria. Fractures that the Leviathan would quickly exploit.\nThe Tides of Diplomacy\nThe council chamber was filled with anxiety. The bioluminescent lights pulsing from the coral walls lit up faces filled with doubt, wrath, and distrust. Sophia sat peacefully at the far end of the room, her hands folded into her lap. She could feel the weight of every look, the unsaid judgment. It was her first formal appearance before the council, and the atmosphere was electric, like the calm before a storm.\nTharros stood at the head of the table, his golden eyes examining the surroundings. The council elders sat stiffly, their skepticism visible as a real force. Coren, as usual, was the first to speak, his tone caustic and cutting.\n\"The Shark Clans, and now this?\" Coren gave Sophia a disdainful wave. \"Are we to accept every stranger into our ranks now? What's next, surface dwellers leading our armies?\"\nA murmur of agreement echoed through the council's conservative faction. Sophia's heart beat, but her demeanor remained neutral. She had prepared for this. She recognized what they saw when they looked at her: a human scientist, an alien in their world. They didn't notice the magic simmering beneath her skin, the power she was only beginning to grasp.\n\"Sophia is not just an outsider,\" Tharros stated calmly but firmly. \"She is essential to bridging the gap between Aquaria and the surface world. Her knowledge and perspective are valuable advantages that we cannot afford to overlook.\n\"And yet her presence brings more risk than reward,\" Coren replied. \"The Leviathan's shadow looms over us, and you would place our trust in someone who cannot even breathe our waters without aid.\"\n\"Enough.\" Tharros' words held enough weight to hush the room. He turned to Sophia, his gaze unwavering. \"Perhaps it is time you speak for yourself.\"\nThe room grew silent, and all eyes turned to her. Sophia took a deep breath, her fingers grabbing the table's edge for support as she stood up. The weight of the occasion pushed down on her, but she returned their gazes one by one, her voice calm despite the tremble in her chest.\n\"I understand your doubts,\" she said, her tone measured. \"I'm not one of you. I was not born in these waters, so I cannot claim to understand your history or the gravity of your difficulties. But I'm here because I believe in the battle. The Leviathan is more than simply your enemy; it poses a threat to all realms, both above and below.\nA few elders shifted uncomfortably, but Coren maintained an emotionless look, his sharp eyes fixated on her.\n\"The surface world has flaws,\" Sophia explained. \"I will not deny it. However, it also possesses resources, technology, and expertise that might swing the balance in our favor. I am not asking you to believe me blindly. I'm asking you to think about what we can gain by working together.\"\nFor a minute, there was only silence. Then, to her amazement, one of the elders (a woman with silver streaks in her hair) spoke up.\n\"She speaks with conviction,\" the elder observed, her voice serious. \"Perhaps we would do well to listen.\"\nCoren tightened his lips but said nothing. The murmurs in the council became louder, a mix of suspicion and reluctant acceptance. Sophia felt a glimmer of hope, but it was swiftly dashed as Coren stood abruptly, his face icy.\n\"Conviction is not enough to protect our people,\" he added, his voice low and threatening. \"Mark my words, Tharros. \"Your faith in this outsider will be our undoing.\"\nWith that, he turned and departed the chamber, leaving numerous conservative elders in his wake. The tension in the room subsided slightly, but the divide remained evident. Sophia fell back into her chair, the weight of the situation coming down on her.\nTharros found her in the hall following the meeting, his demeanor opaque. \"You handled yourself well in there,\" he told me.\n\"Did I?\" Sophia inquired, her voice filled with skepticism. \"I feel like I've only made things worse.\"\nTharros placed his hand on her shoulder, forceful yet soothing. \"Change is never easy. You have sown a seed. Now we must give it time to develop.\"\nSophia nodded, but the ache in her chest persisted. She couldn't shake the impression that Coren's comments were more than a warning. They'd been a threat.\nLater that night, she found herself roaming about the Coral Tower again. The ancient tome she had found earlier called to her, its fractured phrases reverberating in her head. She stretched it out on a stone table, the bioluminescent walls casting strange shadows across the pages.\nArin emerged silently, her presence as disturbing as ever. \"Are you still trying to make sense of it?\" she questioned, her voice full with laughter.\n\"It feels important,\" Sophia replied without looking up. \"Like it's trying to tell me something.\"\nArin's gaze clouded. \"Be cautious with old magic, Sophia. It has a way of unveiling things you might not be expecting to see.\"\nBefore Sophia could react, a harsh knock echoed throughout the tower. A guard entered with a stern expression. \"My Lady, there was an incident at the outer gates. \"You are required immediately.\"\nSophia's stomach sank. She exchanged glances with Arin, who nodded with an enigmatic face. They followed the guard into the depths of the city.\nThe situation at the gates was chaotic. A group of Shark Clan warriors were embroiled in a furious fight with Aquarian guards, their shouts rising above the hum of the city currents. In the midst of the chaos stood Kael, his visage a mask of controlled rage.\n\"What happened?\" Sophia inquired as she approached, her voice breaking through the clamor.\n\"One of the Shark Clan's scouts was found dead near the trenches,\" Kael said, his voice strained. \"The guards claim it was selfdefense, but the Shark Clan doesn't believe them.\"\nSophia's heart fell. This was precisely the type of fissure that the Leviathan would exploit. She took a step forward, speaking calmly but firmly. \"Enough! Fighting among ourselves will not result in any answers. \"Let us hear both sides before passing judgment.\"\nThe crowd paused, then gently parted to allow her through. Kael and Garrek, the Shark Clan's commander, exchanged uneasy glances before nodding in accord.\nAs the story progressed, it became evident that the issue was more complex than it appeared. The guard who delivered the deadly hit claimed the scout had been acting suspiciously, but there was no evidence to back up his assertion. Garrek's warriors were outraged and demanded justice.\nSophia listened intently, her thoughts racing. She could feel the tension in the air, the frail threads that held the alliance together about to shatter. Finally, she looked to Tharros, who had arrived minutes before.\n\"We need to look into this fully,\" she remarked. \"Show both sides that we are committed to the truth, no matter where it leads.\"\nTharros nodded. \"Agreed. Kael, Garrek, I will need your help to conduct a fair investigation.\"\nThey reluctantly consented. The gathering began to disperse, but the discomfort persisted. Sophia felt a glimmer of comfort, but she knew it was just the beginning.\nSophia retreated to the Coral Tower as the city fell into an unsettling state of stillness. She couldn't shake the impression that the Leviathan's shadow was drawing nearer, its influence seeping into the fractures of their fragile relationship. The lines from the ancient tome, The Abyssal Shadow, reverberated in her consciousness once more. An unbroken bond.\nAnd somewhere deep in the trenches, a terrible entity awoke, its laughter a chilly whisper of impending chaos.\nShadows Among Allies\nKael stood in the shadow of Aquaria's military barracks, staring at the rows of troops drilling in the open courtyard. Their synchronized actions should have been reassuring, demonstrating their readiness. But disquiet simmered in his chest, a quiet storm he couldn't dismiss. Something was not right. The whispers had started as little murmurs that moved through the ranks like currents. Discontent. Dissent. And now, subtle indicators that cannot be ignored.\nA soldier's sword broke in mid-swing, breaking into fragments. Kael's eyes sharpened as he stepped forward to pick up the pieces. The metal was brittle and inadequately tempered. He looked at the armorer, who paled under his scrutiny.\n\"This shouldn't happen,\" Kael stated, his voice low but forceful. \"Explain.\"\nThe armorer stuttered, his hands trembling. \"It must be a mistake, Commander.\" The forge -\"\n\"Mistakes like this cost lives,\" Kael interrupted, his tone becoming sharper. He looked at the other guns in the rack, his experienced eye noticing more flaws: uneven edges and tiny fractures. These weren't simply accidents. Somebody had messed with their supplies.\nThe weight of the discovery rested heavy on his shoulders. Aquaria's military was its backbone, serving as both the first and last line of defense against the Leviathan's mounting menace. If that foundation was weakened, their entire kingdom was jeopardized.\nKael straightened and his expression hardened. \"Double your inspections. Every weapon and piece of armor. \"I'd like them checked by morning.\"\nThe armorer nodded, his face pallid, and hurried away. Kael lingered, his mind racing. This wasn't simply sabotage. It was betrayal.\nLater that evening, Kael discovered Sophia in the Coral Tower. She sat at a table, the ancient tome spread out before her, its pages glowing faintly in the bioluminescent light. Her brow wrinkled as she traced a line of writing with her finger, and her lips moved silently.\n\"Sophia,\" Kael remarked, breaking the silence.\nShe looked up, alarmed, but then relaxed as she spotted him. \"Kael. \"What is it?\"\nHe paused, the words stuck in his throat. Confiding in someone-even Sophia-was not something he did lightly. But the weight of what he'd discovered was too heavy to endure alone.\n\"There's unrest in the military,\" he finally replied, moving closer. \"Whispers of dissent. \"And now...sabotage.\"\nSophia's eyes widened. \"Sabotage? \"How serious?\"\n\"Serious enough,\" Kael responded. He described what he discovered: malfunctioning weaponry, missing supplies, and a growing sense of disquiet among the ranks. Sophia's countenance changed from amazement to concern, then determination, as he spoke.\n\"Who do you think is behind it?\" she inquired.\nKael shakes his head. \"I do not know. But whoever it is, they're cautious. They did a good job of covering their traces. I can't present this to the council unless I have more proof.\"\nSophia nodded, her mind already active. \"Then we will discover proof. Quietly.\"\nHer confidence was infectious, and Kael felt a glimmer of optimism. He had come to her out of desperation, but now he recognized the wisdom of it. Sophia had a talent for finding connections that others overlooked and cutting through the noise to get to the heart of the issue.\n\"Where do we start?\" he inquired.\nSophia closed the book and stood, her gaze fixed. \"With the soldiers.\" If discontent spreads, someone is aware of it. \"We just need to find the right thread to pull.\"\nThe next day, Kael and Sophia went through the barracks as part of normal inspections. Kael's presence commanded respect, but the soldiers were drawn to Sophia's gentle, accessible nature. She asked inquiries that appeared innocent on the surface but dug deeper than they imagined.\n\"Have you noticed anything unusual lately?\" She asked a young recruit in a casual tone. \"Supplies going missing, weapons breaking?\"\nThe recruit paused, looking at Kael before responding. \"There was a shipment last week.\" Some of the cartons were half-empty when they arrived. \"We assumed it was a mistake, but...\n\"But?\" Sophia prompted softly.\n\"It's not the first time,\" the recruit said, his voice dropping. \"Some older soldiers have been acting strangely.\" Whispering when they believe no one is listening. \"I'm not sure what it means, but it's unsettling.\"\nKael's jaw tensed, but his expression remained neutral. \"Thank you,\" he replied, slapping the recruit on the shoulder. \"You've been helpful.\"\nAs they moved away, Sophia looked at him. \"It's worse than we expected. This isn't just sabotage; it's orchestrated.\"\nKael nodded grimly. \"And if it's organized, it's coming from higher up.\"\nTheir research led them to storage chambers located deep beneath the barracks. The air was chilly and moist, and the walls were lined with shelves of supplies. Kael's keen eyes examined the room, noticing gaps where containers should have been.\n\"Someone's been here,\" he added quietly.\nSophia knelt beside a stack of crates, her fingers touching the floor. She held up a little fragment of glass, the edges sharp and sparkling in the dim light.\n\"A broken vial,\" she explained. \"This is not a standard issue. \"It is... alchemical.\"\nKael frowned. \"What does that mean?\"\nSophia furrowed her brow. \"It indicates that someone is accessing resources that do not belong here. And they are being careless.\"\nA noise behind them caused them both to freeze. Kael pulled his blade in one seamless stroke, his body tensed. Sophia arose slowly, her heart hammering.\n\"Who's there?\" Kael demanded, his voice echoing around the room.\nFor a minute, there was silence. Then a shadow moved along the room's edge. Kael pounced, his blade flashing in the faint light, but the person moved quickly, sliding between shelves.\n\"Stop!\" Kael barked as he chased.\nSophia followed, her breath coming in short bursts as they navigated the maze of supplies. The figure was ahead of them, moving with the accuracy of someone familiar with the pattern. They rounded a bend, and Kael skidded to a stop, his blade lifted.\nThe figure was gone.\nKael cursed under his breath as his chest heaved. Sophia caught up with him, her face paler but resolute.\n\"They're here,\" she murmured, barely audible. \"Whoever's behind this, they're watching us.\"\nKael nodded with his jaw tightened. The weight of the situation pressed down on him more than ever. The adversary was not just outside their boundaries. It was within.",

        "content": "As they returned to the top floors, they discussed the consequences of their discovery. Kael's mind was racing with thoughts, but one in particular jumped out: they couldn't trust anyone. Not until they understood the full extent of the betrayal.\nSophia touched his arm, catching his attention. \"We'll figure this out,\" she said calmly. \"Together.\"\nWhispers in the Coral Tower\nThe Coral Tower rose in the distance, its angular spirals rising like frozen waves against the pale glow of the Aquarian currents. Sophia followed Arin in silence, her interest sharpening with every step. The sea witch moved with an ease that felt almost predatory, her dark robe billowing behind her like ink spreading through water. She had appeared suddenly that morning, offering Sophia an invitation that was more command than request.\n\"I thought it was time you saw the Tower,\" Arin had said, her tone leaving no room for refuse.\nNow, as they neared the towering structure, Sophia felt a mix of excitement and unease. The Coral Tower was wrapped in mystery, even among the Aquarians. It was said to be a repository of old magic, its halls filled with secrets that could unravel the fabric of the world itself.\nArin stopped at the entrance, her hand resting lightly on the crystalline archway. She glanced back at Sophia, her face unreadable. \"Stay close,\" she said. \"The Tower has a way of confusing those who don't belong.\"\nSophia nodded, her pulse increasing as they stepped inside. The air shifted instantly, growing colder and heavier, as if the Tower were alive and aware of their presence. The walls glimmered slightly, their surfaces etched with runes that seemed to pulse in rhythm with Sophia's heartbeat.\n\"This way,\" Arin said, her voice echoing softly in the cavernous room. She led Sophia through a series of winding hallways, each one more labyrinthine than the last. The further they went, the more confused Sophia felt. It was as if the Tower were shifting around them, its structure defying logic.\nFinally, they reached a room bathed in an otherworldly light. A massive table carved from black coral stood at its center, ringed by shelves laden with scrolls and tomes that radiated an aura of old power. Arin gestured for Sophia to sit, then began sifting through the books with studied ease.\n\"Why did you bring me here?\" Sophia asked, her voice tinged with both interest and suspicion.\nArin didn't look up. \"You've been asking questions. About the forecast, about your role in all of this. I thought it was time you found some answers.\"\nShe pulled a tome from the shelf and put it on the table before Sophia. Its cover was worn, the edges frayed, but the symbols etched into its surface glowed faintly, as if reacting to her touch.\nSophia paused before opening it. The pages were brittle, filled with a script that seemed to shift and shine under her gaze. She could only make out fragments of the writing, but what she saw sent a chill down her spine:\nThe Fated Bond. The Union of Four. The Abyss shall rise, and the Light shall fall. Only through unity can the Shadows be stopped.\n\"What does it mean?\" Sophia whispered, her fingers tracing the faded words.\nArin's expression stayed guarded. \"Prophecies are rarely straightforward. They speak in riddles, hinting at facts we may not understand until it's too late.\"\nSophia looked up at her, frowning. \"You've seen this before, haven't you?\"\nFor a moment, Arin's mask slipped, and something flickered in her eyes-fear, sorrow, or perhaps something darker. But it was gone as quickly as it had arrived.\n\"I know enough to be wary of it,\" she said, her voice carefully controlled. \"The Union of Four it's not just a bond. It's a job. One that comes with a cost.\"\nSophia's pulse quickened. \"And this Union it's me, Tharros, Kael, and you, isn't it?\"\nArin didn't answer instantly. Instead, she leaned back, her eyes drifting to the glowing runes on the walls. \"You're perceptive, I'll give you that. But there are things even I don't fully understand. The Tower it shows what it chooses, when it chooses.\"\nSophia's anger bubbled to the surface. \"Why are you being so cryptic? If you know something, just tell me.\"\nArin's eyes snapped back to hers, sharp and unyielding. \"Because knowledge is a weapon, Sophia. And the wrong information, at the wrong time, can destroy you.\"\nThe room fell into a tense silence. Sophia's mind raced, trying to piece together the fragments of the prophecy, the hints of Arin's guarded past, the weight of the bond she was only starting to comprehend. She didn't trust Arin fully, but she couldn't deny the connection between them. It was like an unsaid thread, pulling them together even as it threatened to unravel everything.\n\"What happens if we fail?\" Sophia asked quietly.\nArin's face darkened. \"Failure isn't an option. Not if you value what remains of this world.\"\nThe cryptic threat hung heavy in the air, and Sophia couldn't shake the feeling that Arin knew far more than she was letting on. But before she could press further, a faraway sound echoed through the Tower-a low, resonant hum that seemed to vibrate through the very walls.\nArin's demeanor shifted quickly, her body tensing like a predator detecting danger. \"We're not alone,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.\nSophia's heart leapt into her throat. \"What do you mean?\"\nArin didn't answer. She rose quickly, her movements fluid and purposeful, and gestured for Sophia to follow. They slipped through the labyrinthine halls, the glow of the runes casting strange shadows that danced along the walls. The hum grew stronger, more insistent, like the heartbeat of the Tower itself.\nThey rounded a turn and froze. A figure stood at the far end of the hallway, its features obscured by the shifting light. It didn't move, but the air around it seemed to ripple with an unnatural force.\n\"Stay behind me,\" Arin whispered, her voice low and steady. She raised a hand, and a faint glow began to emerge from her palm, the magic coiling like smoke.\nThe figure took a step forward, and Sophia caught a glimpse of its face. Or rather, the lack of one. Its features were blurred, unclear, as if it were more shadow than substance. A cold fear washed over her, but she forced herself to stay calm.\n\"What is that?\" she whispered.\n\"A shade,\" Arin answered, her tone grim. \"An echo of the Leviathan's corruption. It shouldn't be here.\"\nThe shade moved closer, its form changing and flickering like a flame caught in a draft. Arin's magic flared brighter, and with a swift move, she hurled a bolt of energy toward it. The shade dissipated with a hiss, but the air stayed heavy, charged with an unseen menace.\nArin dropped her hand, her breathing steady but her eyes wary. \"The Tower's defenses are weakening. The Leviathan's reach is spreading faster than I thought.\"\nSophia swallowed hard, her mind spinning. If the Leviathan could enter even the Coral Tower, then nowhere in Aquaria was truly safe. The weight of the prophecy pressed down on her, its vague warnings now feeling far too real.\nArin turned to her, her face unusually serious. \"Whatever doubts you have, cast them aside. The Union of Four isn't just a promise. It's a lifesaver. And if we fail to understand it\" She trailed off, the unsaid words lingering like a shadow.\nSophia nodded, her resolve stiffening. Whatever lay ahead, she knew one thing for certain: she couldn't face it alone.\nBut as they left the Tower, its whispers fading into silence, a new thought gnawed at the edges of her mind. What was Arin hiding? And how far would she go to keep her secrets?\nThe Cracks Deepen\nThe city of Aquaria buzzed with a nervous energy. Since the Shark Clans' arrival, the rhythm of everyday life had shifted, and not for the better. Their warriors, roughedged and brimming with an air of authority, strode through the glowing streets as if they owned them. Aquarian citizens watched with wary eyes, their bioluminescent scales dimming in response to the stress. It felt as though the Leviathan's shadow wasn't the only storm building beneath the waves.\nKael knew the integration wouldn't be easy, but he hadn't expected just how volatile it would become. He stood at the edge of the marketplace, watching the growing crowd with a sinking feeling in his chest. The air crackled with hostility, the voices of Shark warriors and Aquarian merchants rising in heated debate.\n\"You call this a fair trade?\" a Shark fighter growled, slamming a piece of coralencrusted armor onto the merchant's stall. His sharp teeth gleamed as his words cut through the murmuring of the crowd. \"This is junk! Are you trying to cheat us?\"\nThe merchant, an older Aquarian with a light shimmer to his skin, squared his shoulders. \"That armor has served Aquarian warriors for generations. If you don't value quality, perhaps you should return to your own forges.\"\nGasps spread through the onlookers. The Shark warrior bristled, his fins flaring in a show of aggressiveness. His hand moved toward the handle of his blade, but before he could draw it, another voice cut through the tension like a blade itself.\n\"Enough.\"\nKael stepped forward, his tone calm but carrying the weight of authority. The crowd parted for him, their eyes flickering between him and the Shark fighter. The tension in the marketplace seemed to tighten, every breath held in expectation.\nThe fighter turned, his eyes narrowing as he sized Kael up. \"Stay out of this, mer,\" he growled. \"This is between me and this merchant.\"\nKael didn't move. \"You're in Aquaria now. That means you follow our rules. Violence won't get you what you want here.\"\nThe Shark warrior's lip curled, but before he could react, another figure stepped forward. Garrek, the leader of the Shark Clans, loomed larger than life, his presence commanding attention even without saying a word. His cold gaze swept over the scene before resting on Kael.\n\"Your people treat us like outsiders,\" Garrek said, his voice low but having an edge that cut deep. \"We came here to fight alongside you, to risk our lives for your kingdom, and this is how we're welcomed?\"\nKael met Garrek's stare headon. \"Respect is earned, not demanded,\" he said, his voice calm. \"Your warriors have been here less than a week, and already you've disrupted the city's balance. If you want to be treated as equals, you need to act like it.\"\nThe crowd murmured, some nodding in agreement, while others traded uneasy glances. Garrek's jaw stiffened, his sharp teeth glinting in the pale light. For a moment, it seemed as though he might lash out, but then he gave a short nod.\n\"Very well,\" he said, his tone measured. \"But if you expect us to fight for your kingdom, then prove to us that we're valued. Prove that this partnership is more than just words.\"\nKael's eyes narrowed. \"And how would you have me do that?\"\nGarrek's lips curled into a hungry smile. \"A challenge. You and me. A test of strength and willpower. Let your people see that we are not so different after all.\"\nGasps rippled through the crowd again, but Kael's face remained unreadable. He looked at Tharros, who had arrived moments earlier and now stood silently at the edge of the scene. The Dragon King gave a slight nod, his golden eyes sparkling with approval.\n\"Very well,\" Kael said, moving forward. \"But understand this: if you challenge me, you challenge Aquaria. And I will not hold back.\"\nThe challenge took place in the central arena, a massive area carved from ancient coral and surrounded by bioluminescent spectators. The air thrummed with anticipation as Kael and Garrek squared off, their weapons gleaming in the soft glow of the city's light. The tension was obvious, every eye fixed on the two warriors.\nGarrek moved first, his blade slicing through the water with deadly accuracy. Kael parried, his moves fluid and calculated. The clash of metal rang out, echoing through the arena as the two combatants tried each other's limits.\nGarrek was strong, his attacks relentless, but Kael's experience and discipline kept him one step ahead. He danced around Garrek's strikes, his own blade finding openings that left shallow cuts on the Shark warrior's arms and chest. The crowd roared with each exchange, their voices a mix of excitement and fear.\nAs the battle wore on, Kael started to notice something. Garrek's movements, while powerful, lacked the precision and plan of a seasoned leader. He fought like someone with something to prove, not someone with nothing to lose. Kael filed the information away, his mind racing even as his body moved instinctively.\nFinally, Kael saw his chance. Garrek overextended on a swing, and Kael countered with a swift strike to the hilt of his blade, sending it spinning from his hold. Before Garrek could respond, Kael's blade was at his throat, the sharp edge glinting in the pale light.\nThe arena fell silent, the only sound the heavy breathing of the two fighters. Kael held Garrek's eyes, his voice steady and unyielding. \"This is what it means to lead,\" he said. \"Strength is not just about power. It's about control. Discipline. Respect. If you want to stand with us, you must learn that.\"\nGarrek stared at him for a long moment, his chest heaving. Then, slowly, he nodded. Kael lowered his blade and stepped back, the tension in the stadium dissolving into a wave of cheers and applause.\nAfter the match, Kael found himself in the quiet of the training grounds, his thoughts a whirlwind of feelings. The victory had been important, but it didn't feel like a triumph. The cracks in their union were still there, threatening to widen with every passing day.\nSophia approached, her face a mix of concern and admiration. \"You handled that well,\" she said.\nKael glanced at her, his jaw tightening. \"Did I? It feels like we're holding this union together with threads, and one wrong move will tear it apart.\"\nSophia put a hand on his arm, her touch grounding him. \"You're doing what needs to be done, Kael. That's more than most can say.\"\nHe sighed, his shoulders dropping slightly. \"I just hope it's enough.\"\nBefore Sophia could reply, a messenger arrived, his face pale and his voice trembling. \"Commander Kael, Lady Sophia there's been an incident at the eastern gates. You're needed immediately.\"\nKael's stomach dropped, the weight of his duties crashing down on him once again. He traded a glance with Sophia, her eyes mirroring his unspoken fears.\n\"Let's go,\" he said, his voice steady despite the chaos within. As they hurried toward the gates, the cracks in Aquaria's fragile peace seemed to deepen, the shadows of dissent getting darker with every step.\nTrials of Balance\nSophia stood at the edge of the council room, her pulse quickening as the voices around her rose and fell like waves crashing against the shore. The Shark Clans' representatives were sitting on one side, their powerful forms radiating a quiet defiance. Opposite them sat Aquarian officials, their shimmering scales catching the pale light of the coral lamps. Between them lay a chasm of mistrust, centuries of competition and disdain threatening to drown any chance of cooperation.\n\"We cannot simply hand over our resources to outsiders,\" one elder said sternly, his tone cutting through the low murmurs. His eyes shifted to Sophia, narrowing. \"And now we're expected to trust her? A top dweller who doesn't belong here?\"\nThe words stung, but Sophia kept her face calm. She had expected this. Ever since she had stepped into Aquaria's world, she had felt the undercurrent of hostility from certain factions, especially the conservative council members who viewed her presence as a threat.\n\"Enough,\" Tharros said, his golden eyes narrowing as he leaned forward. His voice carried the power of a king, silencing the room. \"Sophia is here because she has proven her value time and again. Her insights have saved lives and strengthened our relationships. If you cannot see that, the fault lies with you, not her.\"\nSophia felt a surge of gratitude, but she knew Tharros' protection would only go so far. The room's tension stayed thick, the divide between the factions as palpable as the currents beyond the chamber walls. She took a deep breath and stepped forward, her voice steady as she addressed the room.\n\"I understand your concerns,\" she started, her gaze sweeping across the gathered officials and Shark warriors. \"Trust is not built overnight, and centuries of mistrust cannot be erased with a single alliance. But we are facing an enemy that threatens all of us. The Leviathan doesn't care about our differences. It will kill us if we cannot find a way to stand together.\"\nHer words hung in the air, met with a mix of thoughtful silence and skeptical looks. Garrek, the Shark Clans' head, leaned back in his chair, his sharp teeth gleaming as he spoke.\n\"Bold words,\" he said, his tone laced with both admiration and dare. \"But words alone won't earn our loyalty. Actions will.\"",

        "content": "Sophia nodded. \"Then let's start with action. I suggest joint efforts-training exercises, resourcesharing initiatives-to build the trust we need. It won't be easy, but it's a start.\"\nThe room murmured again, calmer this time. One of the progressive Aquarian officials, a younger woman with scales that shimmered like sunlight, spoke up.\n\"It's a reasonable proposal,\" she said. \"We cannot afford to waste time arguing among ourselves. Let's put it to a vote.\"\nThe conservative elders traded glances, their reluctance clear. But Tharros' steady gaze and Sophia's calm determination left them little room to complain. The motion passed by a thin margin, and the room slowly began to disperse.\nOutside the chamber, Sophia exhaled heavily, the tension in her chest easing slightly. She felt a presence beside her and turned to see Kael, his face unreadable.\n\"You did well in there,\" he said, his tone quieter than usual. \"But don't let your guard down. There are those who will do anything to see you fail.\"\nSophia nodded, her resolve stiffening. \"I'm aware. But I won't let them frighten me.\"\nKael studied her for a moment, then gave a small nod of approval. \"Good. Keep that fire. You'll need it.\"\nThe following days were a whirlwind of action. Sophia threw herself into her new role, organizing joint training lessons between Aquarian guards and Shark warriors. The meetings were anything but smooth; clashing egos and simmering tensions led to more than one heated confrontation.\nDuring one such practice, Sophia stood on the sidelines, watching as an argument broke out between a young Shark warrior and an Aquarian guard. Their voices rose, sharp and biting, until the Shark warrior lunged forward, his fins flaring in aggressiveness.\nBefore Sophia could intervene, Kael stepped in, his presence commanding instant attention. \"Stand down,\" he said, his voice low but strong. The Shark warrior paused, his gaze flicking to Garrek, who stood nearby. At a subtle nod from his boss, the warrior backed away, grumbling under his breath.\nSophia approached Kael, her frustration obvious. \"This isn't working,\" she said. \"If we can't even get through a single training session without a fight breaking out, how are we supposed to build trust?\"\nKael's face softened slightly. \"It's going to take time. These warriors have spent their entire lives viewing each other as enemies. Changing that won't happen overnight.\"\nSophia nodded, though the weight of the job ahead pressed heavily on her shoulders. She turned back to the training grounds, her mind racing with ideas to bridge the gap.\nThat evening, Sophia found herself in one of Aquaria's quieter passageways, lost in thought. The day's events had left her drained, her confidence wavering under the pressure of the mounting challenges. She barely noticed the figure approaching until a sharp voice cut through her thoughts.\n\"You don't belong here.\"\nShe turned to see Coren, one of the most vocal conservative council members, his face hard and unforgiving. His words struck like a blow, and for a moment, she fought to find her voice.\n\"Excuse me?\" she said, her tone steadier than she felt.\nCoren stepped closer, his eyes piercing. \"You're an outsider. A top dweller. You may have Tharros' favor, but don't think for a moment that you'll ever be one of us.\"\nSophia's chest tightened, rage flaring alongside the sting of his words. \"I'm not trying to be one of you,\" she said, her voice sharp. \"I'm trying to help. If that's a problem for you, then maybe you're the one who doesn't belong.\"\nCoren's expression darkened, but before he could reply, another voice interrupted.\n\"Is there a problem here?\"\nSophia turned to see Tharros coming, his golden eyes flicking between her and Coren. The council member stiffened, his stance defensive.\n\"No problem at all,\" Coren said, his tone dripping with insincerity. He gave Sophia one last look before turning and walking away.\nTharros watched him go, then turned to Sophia, his face softening. \"Don't let him get to you,\" he said. \"Coren is a relic of the past. His fear blinds him to what's possible.\"\nSophia nodded, though the meeting had left her shaken. Tharros put a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"You're doing more than anyone expected, Sophia. Don't question yourself now.\"\nShe met his eyes, drawing strength from his confidence. \"I won't,\" she said, her resolve stiffening once more.\nAs the days turned to weeks, the joint efforts began to show small signs of improvement. The training sessions grew less contentious, and moments of camaraderie emerged, fragile but real. Sophia's tireless efforts won her the grudging respect of the Shark warriors and the wary admiration of the progressive Aquarians.\nBut the shadows of prejudice and mistrust lingered, and Sophia knew the road ahead would be anything but easy. Late one night, as she stood on a balcony viewing the glowing city, she felt the weight of it all pressing down on her.\n\"This is only the beginning,\" she murmured to herself, her gaze fixed on the faraway horizon.\nSecrets in the Depths\nThe Coral Tower stood out in the dim light of Aquaria's shifting currents. Its spiraling shape cast rough shadows on the ocean bottom. Sophia walked slowly toward the gates, her mind going over parts of the mysterious text she had found days before. Each word and phrase seemed like a puzzle that wouldn't fit into the picture she was making in her mind.\nArin waited just inside, and as usual, you couldn't read her face. Her dark eyes were fixed on Sophia as she leaned casually against the clear doorway. She seemed tense and guarded, and Sophia couldn't help but notice it.\n\"You're late,\" Arin said in her usual stern voice.\nSophia walked past her with a shrug. \"I had no idea you were keeping track.\"\n\"You're the one who insists on answers,\" Arin answered, pushing off the wall and falling into step beside her. \"I hope you're ready for what you might find.\"\nSophia didn't answer. The Tower's halls seemed colder today, their runes pulsing faintly as if feeling her unease. The silence between her and Arin stretched, broken only by the soft hum of the Tower's old magic. Finally, they reached the room where the text awaited, spread across a stone table like a relic from another age.\nSophia moved to the table, her fingers brushing the leaves. The symbols shimmered slightly, shifting as if alive. She glanced at Arin, who stayed by the doorway, her arms crossed.\n\"Are you going to help, or just stand there?\" Sophia asked, her tone laced with anger.\nArin's lips twitched, a hint of amusement breaking through her otherwise stoic face. \"I'll help. But don't expect me to enjoy it.\"\nShe joined Sophia at the table, her hands hanging over the text. The runes reacted instantly, glowing brighter under her touch. Sophia watched her carefully, noting the flicker of uneasiness in Arin's eyes.\n\"What do you know about this?\" Sophia asked, keeping her tone bland.\nArin paused, her fingers tracing a line of symbols. \"Not enough,\" she said eventually. \"And too much.\"\nSophia frowned. \"That's not an answer.\"\nArin's eyes snapped to hers, sharp and unyielding. \"Some answers come with consequences, Sophia. Are you sure you're ready for them?\"\nThe challenge in her words was clear, but Sophia refused to back down. \"We don't have time for riddles. If this text can help us understand the Leviathan and what's coming, then we need to know everything.\"\nArin's face softened, just slightly. She sighed, her shoulders relaxing as she turned back to the text. \"Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you.\"\nThe hours passed in a blur as they worked together, decoding bits of the text. Sophia's frustration grew with each cryptic phrase, but Arin's steady direction kept her grounded. Slowly, a pattern began to appear, hints of a story that sent chills down Sophia's spine.\nAn old force bound in shadow. A union formed in fire and blood. The rise of the Abyss, and the fall of the Light.\nSophia looked at the words, their meaning sinking in. \"The Leviathan,\" she whispered. \"It's tied to this this ancient force.\"\nArin nodded, her face grim. \"The Leviathan isn't just a monster. It's an expression of something older, something that predates even the founding of Aquaria.\"\nSophia's mind raced, putting together what she knew. \"And this union? The 'bond in fire and blood'? It's talking about us, isn't it? Me, Tharros, Kael, and you.\"\nArin didn't respond quickly. Her gaze was faraway, her fingers drumming lightly against the table. Finally, she spoke, her voice low. \"That's what it suggests. But predictions are rarely clear. There's always a price, Sophia. Always.\"\nSophia frowned. \"What aren't you telling me?\"\nArin's gaze snapped to hers, the unease in her eyes obvious. \"You think I have all the answers? I don't. But I know enough to be afraid. Magic like this it doesn't come without consequences.\"\nThe tension between them was thick, unsaid questions lingering in the air. Sophia wanted to press her, to demand the truth, but something in Arin's face held her back. Instead, she turned back to the text, her determination hardening.\nAs the hours wore on, Arin grew quieter, her attention shifting inward. Sophia noticed the change but said nothing, her own thoughts consumed by the revelations they had found. The Leviathan's connection to an ancient enemy, the part of the Union it was almost too much to process.\nBut Arin's unease didn't go ignored. Every so often, Sophia caught her looking at the door, her fingers twitching as if itching to leave. It was slight, but it was there. And it made Sophia wonder: what was Arin hiding?\nFinally, as they reached a particularly troubling passage, Arin stood suddenly, her chair scraping against the stone floor. \"That's enough for today,\" she said, her voice tight.\nSophia looked up, shocked. \"We're not finished.\"\n\"We've done enough,\" Arin said, already moving toward the door. \"You should get some rest.\"\nSophia watched her go, mistrust gnawing at the edges of her thoughts. Something was wrong. Arin was hiding something, and whatever it was, it had shaken her deeply.\nUnbeknownst to Sophia, Arin didn't leave the Tower. She retreated to a smaller chamber, its walls lined with mirrors that reflected her troubled face back at her. Her hands trembled as she reached for a bottle of dark liquid hidden in the folds of her robe.\nThe magic in the vial pulsed slightly, a forbidden power that she had sworn never to use again. But the text had confirmed her fears. The Leviathan wasn't just a threat to Aquaria; it was a punishment for her past sins, a force that had been waiting for centuries to rise again.\nArin closed her eyes, her mind rushing. If the prophecy was true, then the Union of Four was their only chance. But it also meant confronting the darkness she had long buried, the decisions she had made that had led to this moment.\nShe stared into the vial, her image warped and twisted by the liquid's dark glow. \"Not yet,\" she whispered, her voice shaking. \"Not yet.\"\nBack in her rooms, Sophia couldn't shake the feeling that she was missing something. The parts of the puzzle were starting to come together, but there was still so much she didn't understand. And as she looked out at the glowing city, a sense of foreboding settled over her.\nThe Leviathan was coming. And with it, the secrets of the depths would finally come to light.\nA Rift in the Ranks\nKael's footsteps echoed through the stone hallways of the barracks, his jaw tight and his mind racing. The sense of deception burned hotter with each passing moment. The signs had been there for weeks-the missing supplies, the tampered weapons, the stress simmering beneath the surface. Now it all made sense, but the realization left a bitter taste in his mouth. The men he trusted, the soldiers who were meant to protect Aquaria, had turned against him.\nThe small room he entered was dimly lit, the only light coming from a lantern hanging above the center table. Maps and reports were scattered across its surface, proof of Kael's relentless pursuit of the truth. He slammed a fist down on the table, the irritation coursing through him like a tidal wave.\nA voice broke the quiet behind him. \"You look ready to tear someone apart.\"\nKael turned sharply to see Sophia standing in the doorway. Her expression was a mix of worry and curiosity. She had become a fixture in these investigations, her sharp mind proving useful in piecing together clues. But this this was something Kael wished she didn't have to see.\n\"I've found them,\" he said, his voice low and cold.\nSophia stepped closer, her eyes narrowing. \"Found who?\"\n\"The ones responsible for the sabotage,\" Kael answered. \"It's not just one or two. There's a faction within the troops. They resent the agreement with the Shark Clans, and they see you as a threat to Aquaria's traditions.\"\nSophia's face fell, but she quickly masked her feelings. \"Do you know who's leading them?\"\nKael nodded, his jaw tightening. \"An officer. Someone I trusted.\"\nKael didn't wait for Sophia's answer. He was already moving, his steps purposeful and his mind focused on what needed to be done. The officer-Commander Jarek-had been with Kael for years. They had fought side by side, weathered countless wars together. The thought of confronting him filled Kael with a mix of rage and regret.\nHe found Jarek in the training yard, barking orders at a group of trainees. The sight was almost ridiculous, given what Kael now knew. Jarek turned as Kael neared, his expression shifting from surprise to something more guarded.\n\"Commander Kael,\" Jarek said, his tone carefully bland. \"What brings you here?\"\nKael's eyes burned with suspicion. \"We need to talk. Now.\"\nJarek paused, then nodded, dismissing the recruits with a sharp gesture. They moved to a quieter area of the yard, the tension between them palpable.\n\"What's this about?\" Jarek asked, though his tone suggested he already knew.\nKael didn't waste time. \"The sabotage. The lost supplies. The guns that broke during training. I know you're behind it.\"\nJarek's face hardened, his eyes narrowing. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\"Don't lie to me,\" Kael growled, moving closer. \"I've seen the reports. I've heard the tales. You've been gathering men against the Shark Clans, against Sophia. Against me.\"\nJarek's jaw tightened, and for a moment, Kael thought he might deny it again. But then the officer's shoulders straightened, his face defiant.\n\"You're damn right I've been gathering them,\" Jarek said, his voice rising. \"The Shark Clans don't belong here. They're savages, and they'll turn on us the first chance they get. And Sophia? She's a surface person. She has no place in Aquaria's affairs.\"\nKael's hands clenched at his sides. \"Sophia has done more for Aquaria than you ever will. And the Shark Clans are our friends. You don't have to like it, but you will respect it.\"\nJarek's laugh was bitter. \"Respect? You think bringing outsiders into our ranks is strength? It's weakness, Kael. And it's going to get us all killed.\"\nKael's patience snapped. He grabbed Jarek by the neck, slamming him against the wall. The recruits in the yard froze, their eyes wide as they watched the fight.\n\"You've betrayed your oath,\" Kael said through gritted teeth. \"You've put every soldier in this city at risk. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't drag you before the council right now.\"\nJarek sneered, defiant. \"Because I'm not the only one. There are more of us, Kael. And no matter what you do, you can't stop us.\"\nKael's grip tightened, his anger boiling over. But before he could move, a voice cut through the tension.\n\"Kael, stop.\"\nHe turned to see Tharros standing at the edge of the yard, his golden eyes calm but demanding. Kael released Jarek, who stumbled but quickly recovered, his stubbornness intact.\n\"Get out of my sight,\" Kael growled. \"And pray that I don't find you again.\"\nJarek glared at him, then turned and stalked away, the recruits parting to let him pass. Kael watched him go, his chest heaving with rage and frustration.\nLater, Kael sat with Tharros in a private room, the weight of the day pressing heavily on him. He recalled the confrontation, his voice laced with bitterness.\n\"I trusted him,\" Kael said, his hands curled into fists. \"I trusted all of them. How could I have been so blind?\"\nTharros studied him for a moment before speaking. \"Leadership isn't about being perfect, Kael. It's about making hard choices and sticking by them. You've done that. And you'll need to keep doing it, even when it feels impossible.\"",

        "content": "Kael looked up, meeting Tharros' eyes. \"What if I fail? What if this this divide tears us apart?\"\nTharros' face softened, his voice steady. \"Then you fight harder. You tell them why they follow you. And you don't let the ones who fail you define the ones who stay loyal.\"\nKael nodded, the weight in his chest easing slightly. Tharros' words didn't remove the pain of Jarek's betrayal, but they gave him a sliver of hope. He would fight for Aquaria, for its people, for its future. No matter the cost.\nBut as he sat in the quiet of the room, a lingering unease settled over him. Jarek had spoken of others. How deep did this deception run? And how long before it turned into something far worse?\nUnity or Division\nThe vast council chamber of Aquaria was filled with tension. The space, carved from shimmering coral and lighted by beautiful bioluminescent lamps, felt as if it would collapse beneath the weight of the internal conflict. Voices merged in a wild symphony of rage, terror, and defiance.\nSophia waited in the shadows, watching the sight with a knot in her stomach. The strain was not new, but today it seemed insurmountable. This was more than just a dispute; it was a war for the soul of Aquaria.\nTharros stood at the head of the long, twisting table, his golden eyes scanning the council members. He emanated power, like a monarch whose authority required respect. Despite his powerful presence, he was unable to bring the chaos under control.\n\"The Shark Clans are our allies now,\" Tharros remarked, his voice piercing through the din like a razor. \"They bled for Aquaria.\" They have stood with us against threats that could have devastated us all. Turning them away now is not just ungrateful, but also hazardous.\nCouncillor Tormek, the Coral Clan elder, stood from his seat, his face a mask of rage. \"Dangerous?\" he spit. \"Do you believe the true danger is in rejecting them? Have you forgotten the blood spilled during the wars? How many lives were lost as a result of their savagery?\"\n\"Enough, Tormek,\" Tharros muttered, his tone harsh enough to drown out the muttering that followed the elder's comments. \"The past cannot define the future. We must stick together if we are to withstand what is ahead.\"\nThe room went hushed for a heartbeat before erupting into mayhem again. The dispute erupted, with charges and counterarguments flying like arrows across a battlefield. Sophia's pulse was racing as she watched, torn between rage and grief. These so-called leaders were ripping one other apart, while the genuine menace got closer with each passing instant.\nKael approached her, his voice low and strained. \"They aren't going to listen.\" \"This is going to split the council.\"\nSophia tightened her fists at her side. She had spent weeks researching Aquarian customs, discovering their ideals and worries. She'd seen hints of the prophesy that tied her to Tharros, Kael, and Arin, but nothing prepared her for this. The weight of the kingdom's destiny weighed heavily on her, and she knew she couldn't remain silent any longer.\nShe took a deep breath and went forward, her heels quietly clicking on the stone floor. \"Enough.\"\nHer voice, calm yet commanding, cut through the chaos. Heads turned to face her, their eyes narrowing with doubt, curiosity, and, in some cases, disdain. She felt their judgment like a physical weight on her shoulders, yet she stood erect and met their gazes with unwavering determination.\n\"I understand your fears,\" she said, her voice firm. \"I have heard stories of battle and betrayal. I understand the scars the Shark Clans have left on your history. But clinging onto that anguish and allowing it influence your behavior now can only lead to our demise.\"\nCouncillor Tormek's sneer intensified. \"And what do you know about our history, surface dweller?\" You've only been here a few months, and you dare to lecture us about our traditions?\"\nSophia turned to him, her expression resolute. \"I may not have experienced your conflicts, Councillor, but I have studied them. I understand how animosity and dread tore apart the Abyssal Tribes. They clung to old wounds, paying the price with blood. \"Is that the legacy you want for Aquaria?\"\nA murmur sounded around the room. Some council members exchanged nervous glances, their resolve faltering. Sophia pressed on, her voice rising in conviction.\n\"The Leviathan stirs in the deep,\" she added. \"We've all seen the signs: shadows in the trenches, creatures abandoning their homes. This is not a threat we can face separately. The prophecy speaks of unification, with all clans standing together. If we do not answer that call, we will doom ourselves and our future.\nThe room became silent as the weight of her remarks hung over the council like a storm cloud. Sophia's heart pounded in her chest, but she maintained a steady demeanor and fixed her attention on Tormek. The elder's expression was one of fierce resistance, but there was a spark of uncertainty in his eyes.\n\"You ask us to trust the Shark Clans,\" he added after a time, his voice softer but still firm. \"I trust you. However, trust must be earned rather than commanded.\nSophia nodded, her voice softening. \"You're correct. Trust is earned. And the Shark Clans deserve it. They fought and sacrificed for Aquaria. They demonstrated their allegiance even when they had every reason to leave. If we can't see that, we've failed.\"\nTormek paused, his hands gripping the edge of the table. For a brief moment, it appeared that he would relent. But then his face tightened and he shook his head. \"I will not stand by and let our traditions be trampled. If you insist on taking this route, you will do it without my support.\"\nHe got up from his seat and marched toward the chamber doors. Other conservative members followed him one by one, their departure serving as a harsh reminder of the difference they faced. Sophia's chest squeezed as she watched them leave, the sting of failure threatening to overcome her.\nBut then, a voice cut through the silence.\n\"I will stay.\"\nSophia turned to see Councillor Lyra of the Dolphin Clan there, her face determined. \"I may not agree with everything, but I will not abandon our people in this time of need.\"\nHer statement caused a rippling effect. Other councillors, buoyed by her speech, expressed their support, their desire for togetherness outweighing their fear. The tide slowly began to shift.\nTharros moved forward, his gaze sweeping across the remaining council members. \"This is our chance to prove that Aquaria is stronger together,\" he told reporters. \"That we may overcome our differences and face the future together. \"Let's not waste it.\"\nThe room fell into an unsettling stillness, the weight of their decision hanging in the air. Sophia sighed, relieved yet with residual tightness. They had won the fight, but the war wasn't done.\nAs the council began to disperse and mumble among themselves, Tharros looked to Sophia. His golden eyes were full of thanks and something deeper, unspoken. \"Thank you,\" he replied softly. \"Your words may have saved us today.\"\nSophia mustered a faint smile, but her mind was already racing ahead. \"We're not finished yet.\" \"There is still the Leviathan.\"\nTharros' expression clouded. He looked out the crystalline windows that ringed the chamber, beyond which the dark waters of Aquaria stretched indefinitely. A large and gloomy shadow moved there, serving as a quiet warning of the impending fight.\n\"It's closer than we thought,\" he muttered.\nSophia followed his gaze, her chest constricting as the shadow grew larger, its shape scarcely discernible but undeniably monstrous. The Leviathan, an ancient and relentless force of nature, loomed on the horizon, her approach foreshadowing the difficulties that lay ahead.\nBaptism in the Sacred Pools\nThe Leviathan's shadow stayed in Sophia's consciousness long after the council chamber was empty. The meeting's tension had not completely left her chest, but she didn't have time to linger on it. Tharros' deep, steady voice shattered the silence as they proceeded along the coral-lit halls.\n\"You must undergo the Rite of the Sacred Pools,\" said the priest. \"It's the only way to awaken your full potential before the Leviathan strikes.\"\nSophia paused in her tracks, her pulse racing. She had heard murmurs about the ancient and unpredictable power of the pools. \"What does it involve?\" she said, her voice firm despite the unease that was creeping into her thoughts.\nTharros turned to face her, his golden gaze penetrating yet calm. \"It isn't merely a ritual. It is a trial. The pools tell who you are and who you are destined to become. They reveal what's buried within you-but only if you're willing to confront it.\"\nKael's voice joined them, providing a reassuring anchor in the gathering storm. \"We'll be there with you,\" he murmured, his bluegreen stare unwavering. \"Every step of the way.\"\nArin lingered on the outskirts of the conversation, her enigmatic presence as unsettling as it was captivating. \"The pools don't lie,\" she whispered. \"They will reveal facts you have ignored, Sophia. \"Can you handle that?\"\nSophia returned her gaze, the challenge igniting something stubborn inside her. \"I don't have a choice, do I?\"\nArin's lips formed a faint smile, more shadow than warmth. \"Not if you want to survive.\"\nThe drive to the Sacred Pools was both breathtaking and intimidating. They plunged into the depths of Aquaria, the water becoming colder and darker with each passing moment. The city's bioluminescent glow faded behind them, leaving a profound silence that felt like the ocean was holding its breath.\nThe pools are located within a grotto formed by time and magic. Luminescent crystal veins surged throughout the walls, creating shifting patterns of light on the motionless, dark waters. Sophia felt a shudder run down her spine as she approached. The air, or rather the water around her, looked alive, vibrating with an old force that resonated deep inside her bones.\nTharros placed a hand on her shoulder to ground her. \"The pools will put your willpower and heart to the test.\" \"Remember, you are not alone.\"\nKael stood at her left, his presence strong and trustworthy. \"Trust yourself,\" he replied simply. \"You've come this far for a reason.\"\nArin was the last to speak, her voice a quiet whisper with a hint of warning. \"Let go of what you believe you know. The pools require honesty. Anything less, and they'll devour you.\"\nSophia gulped hard and then nodded. She took a step forward, her foot sliding into the soft, silty floor as she approached the edge of the largest pool. The sea sparkled with iridescent light, enticing and menacing all at once.\n\"What happens now?\" She inquired, her voice hardly more than a breath.\nTharros responded, his tone solemn. \"You enter. \"And you let the pools lead you.\"\nSophia's surroundings changed as soon as she walked into the water. The icy liquid engulfed her, but it wasn't the chill that stopped her breathing. It was a burst of energy, a force so powerful and primal that it felt like it could tear her apart.\nHer eyesight clouded, and the cavern transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes. She felt herself sinking, with no sensation of up or down. Voices rang in her head, pieces of thoughts and memories she couldn't recognize. They swirled around her, overwhelming and confusing.\n\"Focus,\" said Tharros, his voice distant yet distinct. \"Find your center.\"\nSophia closed her eyes, forced herself to take steady breaths amidst the noise. The noise faded gradually, giving way to a steady pulse that matched her heart's rhythm. She opened her eyes to see herself standing in a great expanse of water, its surface reaching endlessly in all directions.\n\"Where am I?\" She whispered, but no one was there to respond.\nA figure rose from the sea, its shape altering and shimmering like liquid light. It was both familiar and exotic, a reflection of herself and something completely other. The figure's eyes shone with an inner fire, commanding and unrelenting.\n\"Who are you?\" Sophia inquired, her voice quivering.\nThe creature tilted its head, a small smile spreading over its lips. \"I am what you fear. What you are denying. \"What you could become.\"\nSophia's breath caught. The comments slashed through her like a razor, exposing weaknesses she thought she'd buried. \"I'm not afraid,\" she responded, but the quaver in her voice betrayed her.\nThe figure moved closer, its eyes penetrating. \"Then prove it.\"\nBack in the cavern, the water around Sophia started to churn. Tharros, Kael, and Arin watched in tense quiet as currents swirled, creating intricate patterns that appeared both chaotic and intentional. The crystals on the walls pulsed in sync with the movements, throwing eerie shadows across the cavern.\n\"She's struggling,\" Kael explained, his fists curled at his sides.\nTharros's expression was bleak. \"She must confront it alone. \"Intervening would only make matters worse.\"\nArin's eyes narrowed, her concentration unwavering. \"She will survive. \"She has to.\"\nSophia's confrontation with the figure peaked in the pool's depths. It lunged at her, its form disintegrating into a torrent of water that slammed into her with unwavering intensity. She strained to stay upright and breathe, but the pressure was too intense. She felt herself descending, plunging into the darkness.\nA recollection arose unexpectedly and vividly. It was the day she first stepped foot in Aquaria, the awe and dread she felt as she was plunged into an unfamiliar environment. She recalled Tharros' piercing glance, Kael's firm presence, and Arin's enigmatic smile. They had been her moorings, her motivation to battle.\n\"You're stronger than this,\" she said to herself, the words a lifeline in the darkness. \"I'm stronger than this.\"\nThe blackness began to fade, replaced by a bright light. Sophia felt a burst of power unlike anything she had ever experienced. It rushed through her veins, sparking every nerve ending with a scorching fury. She opened her eyes to find herself back in the cavern, the water surrounding her gleaming with iridescent beauty.\nShe raised her hand, and the currents responded. They twisted and flowed precisely, according to her every idea. Sophia's chest heaved as she took in the scene, the understanding of who she had become setting in like a second skin.\nTharros walked forward, his face a mix of pride and relief. \"You did it,\" he stated softly.\nKael's palm touched hers, anchoring her as the tremendous energy threatened to swallow her. \"We're with you,\" he stated. \"Always.\"\nArin stood a few paces away, her eyes unreadable. \"The power is yours now,\" she replied. \"But power is a two-edged sword. Use it carefully.\nSophia nodded, but her mind had already turned to the shadow that loomed outside the cave. The Leviathan was closer than ever, and she knew the struggle would require everything she had gained-and more.\nAs they exited the Sacred Pools, the faint glimmer of the crystals faded, leaving the cavern in darkness. Sophia looked back, a shiver racing down her spine. The pools had given her strength, but they also provided glimpses of what lied ahead. The Leviathan's shadow loomed huge in her mind, a foreshadowing of the challenges to come.\n\"We're ready,\" Tharros stated, his voice firm.\nSophia returned his stare, her determination stiffening. \"We have to be.\"\nHowever, when they returned to the city, a distant roar rang through the depths, shaking Aquaria to its very core. Sophia's breath seized and her heart raced as the cacophony faded into an unsettling silence.\nThe Leviathan was no longer waiting. It was coming.\nFractures of Trust\nKael stood on the edge of the council chamber balcony, the huge underwater city of Aquaria sparkling underneath. However, the city's bioluminescent brilliance did little to lift the darkness in his head. The parchment in his fingers felt heavier than it should, its words tearing at his trust like jagged coral.\nA name. Not just any name, but one from his inner circle-someone he'd fought beside and trusted.\nTharros' voice sliced through the tension, forceful yet strained. \"Kael, you have been restless since the pools. \"What is on your mind?\"\nKael turned with his jaw gritted. \"I found something. \"A list.\"\nTharros' golden eyes narrowed, and his presence became formidable. \"A list?\"\nKael hesitated, aware that once the words left his mouth, there was no turning back. \"It implicates several high-ranking officials. \"There are traitors in our ranks.\"\nThe hush that followed was stifling, with its weight pushing down like crushing depths. Sophia, sitting near the luminous map of Aquaria, straightened. \"Traitors? Are you certain?\nKael handed Tharros the parchment, which he examined, his expression deepening with each passing second. \"This This affects everything,\" Tharros said quietly, his tone unreadable. \"If this is true, we're compromised.\"\nSophia leaned forwards, her words fervent. \"What do we do?\"\nKael's fist squeezed at his side. \"We act. Now. \"Expose them before they can cause further damage.\"\nTharros shook his head, his calm manner contrasted strongly with Kael's rage. \"If we move too soon and they're not alone in this, we risk exposing our knowledge and losing the chance to uproot the entire conspiracy.\"\nKael's rage flared. \"Would you risk everything to play the waiting game?\" \"Tharros, this isn't strategy; it's recklessness!\"\nThe air between them crackled with tension. Sophia stepped in, her calm but firm voice providing a steadying presence. \"Stop. Both of you. \"We need a plan that strikes a balance between caution and urgency.\"\nKael's glare softened as it fell on her, but his rage lingered beneath the surface. \"I can't stand by while we're being betrayed from within.\"\nTharros's reaction was shortened. \"And I won't gamble the lives of our people on halfformed evidence.\"\nSophia interjected again, her voice sharper this time. \"Enough. \"If we are divided, we have already lost.\"\nArin entered the room, her face unreadable but her presence electrifying. \"It appears that the cracks in our unity are beginning to show,\" she continued, her tone somewhat amused. \"This won't end well if we don't address it.\"\nSophia frowned. \"You have a suggestion?\"\nArin shrugged, her eyes wandering over the anxious group. \"Trust is like glass-easily broken. But sometimes you have to smash it to discover what's underneath.\"\nTharros exhaled heavily. \"What do you propose, Arin?\"\nHer lips formed a mysterious smile. \"Let the traitors believe they've won. Lay a trap. But be careful; the water is murky, and the currents will draw you under if you don't stay attentive.\"\nKael bristled. \"And if they strike first?\"\nArin's smile grew, becoming colder. \"Then we make sure they regret it.\"\nThe days after were stressful. Kael poured himself into his task, every move deliberate yet driven by rage. His dealings with Tharros became colder, and their once flawless cooperation frayed at the edges.\nSophia regarded the two men warily, feeling the weight of their dissatisfaction permeate into her own heart. The strain was evident, and the sense of oneness they had worked so hard to establish was now on the verge of disintegration.\nMeanwhile, rumours of unrest spread across Aquaria. The Shark Clans, ever vigilant and unpredictable, began to express their doubts. Their leader, Lord Tyros, was the first to publicly criticize Aquaria's leadership.\n\"Your kingdom is losing its grip,\" Tyros hissed during a tense meeting. \"If you cannot protect your own walls, how do you expect to protect the alliance?\"\nTharros returned his gaze with a calm that belied the tempest rising inside him. \"Aquaria has existed for centuries, Tyros. \"Do not mistake our challenges for weakness.\"\nKael, standing directly behind Tharros, could scarcely suppress his displeasure. \"Perhaps you'd like to test that theory, Shark Lord,\" he muttered, his tone low and threatening.\nSophia's hand touched Kael's arm, anchoring him. \"We're here to strengthen the alliance, not break it apart,\" she stated forcefully.\nTyros' attention shifted to Sophia, his sharp teeth glinting in the faint light. \"A surface dweller speaking for Aquaria now? Indeed, times are changing.\"\nKael came forward, but Sophia stopped him with a gentle wave of her head. Instead, she approached Tyros directly. \"You mistrust us because you are afraid of what is going to happen. That is fair. But know this: whatever shadows emerge from the depths, we will confront them together. If you can't stand with us, please get out of our way.\"\nTyros appeared startled for a minute, his countenance a mix of surprise and reluctant respect. He said nothing more, but the tension in the room persisted long after he left.\nLater that evening, Kael sat alone in his chambers, the parchment from before spread out in front of him. Names of people he used to trust glared back at him, like ghosts. He felt the weight of every decision he'd ever made, every fight fought, and every comrade killed.\nA quiet knock on the door interrupted his reverie. \"Come in,\" he growled, gruffly.\nSophia entered, and her presence soothed his strained nerves. \"You've been avoiding everyone.\"\nKael groaned and ran a hand over his hair. \"What is there to say?\" I am losing trust in all I believed in.\"\nSophia approached with a steady stare. \"You aren't alone in this, Kael. \"We will figure it out together.\"\nHe glanced at her, his gaze looking for something-hope, reassurance, anything to hang onto. \"What if I am incorrect, Sophia? \"What if my instincts lead us to ruin?\"\nShe placed her palm on his cheek, grounding him. \"Then let's confront it together. But, Kael, you've never backed down from a fight. Do not start now.\"\nHer words soothed something within him, but before he could answer, a loud alarm rang through the corridors.\nKael leapt to his feet, his warrior instincts kicking in. \"What now?\"\nSophia's expression became stern. \"Let's find out.\"\nWhen they arrived, the council room was alive with activity. Tharros stood in the center, his countenance a mix of fury and disbelief. Arin waited in the darkness, her acute eyes capturing every detail.\n\"What happened?\" Kael demanded.\nTharros turned, his voice low and menacing. \"One of the officers on that list was just caught attempting to sabotage our defenses.\"\nKael's stomach sank. \"Who?\"\nTharros gave him another parchment. Kael's heart sunk when he read the name. It was not just anyone. He thought this person to be a buddy.\nSophia looked at Kael, concern on her face. \"What does this mean?\"\nKael's voice was hardly audible. \"It means the fractures run deeper than we thought.\"\nBefore anyone could answer, another alarm went off-a deeper, more sinister sound. The room became silent as they knew what it meant.\nThe Leviathan was here.\nArin's Confession\nThe alarm's echoes had hardly gone before the council chamber descended into turmoil. Orders were yelled, warriors hurried to build defenses, and the impending arrival of the Leviathan loomed over everyone. Kael stormed out with Tharros, their sole focus on protecting Aquaria.\nSophia lingered, her mind racing as she attempted to put together the developing gaps in their fragile connection. From the corner of her eye, she observed Arin, who was abnormally motionless amidst the chaos, her face pale and her gaze remote.\n\"Arin?\" Sophia called quietly, hesitantly. The sea witch did not react, her gaze fixed on the empty area where Tharros had stood minutes before.\nSophia approached warily. \"Arin, are you alright?\"\nFinally, Arin turned her head, her customary cutting assurance replaced with rawness and vulnerability. \"Come with me,\" she said quietly, her voice barely audible. Without waiting for a response, she went toward the chamber's side door, her motions rigid and rushed.\nSophia followed, uneasiness rising in her chest. She had never seen Arin like this before.\nArin took her to a small hidden area, dimly illuminated and lined with coral shelves and sparkling crystals. As the door closed behind them, the silence became deafening. Arin paced back and forth, her hands quivering slightly-a sight so strange that it sent shivers through Sophia.\n\"Arin, what's going on?\" Sophia inquired, attempting to keep her voice steady.\nArin came to a halt unexpectedly, her back turned to Sophia. \"I've made mistakes, Sophia,\" she said, her voice low and tinged with an emotion Sophia couldn't identify. \"Grave ones.\"\nSophia moved closer, her pulse increasing. \"What kind of mistakes?\"\nArin looked around, her eyes sparkling with unshed tears. \"The kind that helped create the monster outside those walls.\"\nThe room appeared to tilt. Sophia squinted, convinced she had misheard. \"What are you saying?\"\nArin took a nervous breath, her fists tightening at her sides. \"The Leviathan is more than just a force of nature, Sophia. It's the product of old magic, which I was a part of.\nSophia's heart thumped painfully in her chest. \"What do you mean you were part of it?\"\nArin's gaze lowered, and her words hardly rose above a whisper. \"Centuries ago, before Aquaria was what it is now, I desired power. I was determined to prove myself, to break away from the grip of those who questioned me. I delved into forbidden magic-dark, ancient spells designed to harness the ocean's primal forces.\"\nSophia felt the weight of the revelation fall on her like a physical load. \"Arin, what did you do?\"\n\"I thought I could control it,\" Arin explained, her voice shaking. \"I believed I could sculpt the magic and make it mine. But I was mistaken. The spell did not bind, but rather perverted, the ocean's power. It produced something... strange. Something that could not be contained.\nSophia caught her breath as the parts fell into place. \"The Leviathan.\"\nArin nodded, tears flowing over. \"It was not always like this. It remained dormant for generations, trapped in the trenches where the magic originally took hold. But something has changed. The ocean's balance has shifted, and it is now... awake.\nSophia stepped back, her thoughts reeling. \"You... you caused this?\"\n\"I didn't mean to,\" Arin whispered anxiously, her voice heavy with grief. \"I didn't realize what I was unleashing. By the time I noticed, it was too late.\"\nSophia struggled to comprehend the significance of what she was hearing. \"Why are you telling me this now?\"\n\"Because you deserve the truth,\" Arin explained, her voice shaking. \"And because I need to know if you can still trust me.\"\nSophia sat heavily on one of the coral benches, hands grabbing the edge to keep herself stable. \"Arin, this... this changes everything.\"\n\"I know,\" Arin muttered. \"But you must believe me, Sophia. I've spent millennia attempting to atone for my actions. Everything I've done since-every spell, every sacrifice-has been to preserve Aquaria and prevent this from happening. But I failed.\"\nSophia looked up to meet Arin's gaze. The raw pain was apparent. \"Why didn't you tell Tharros or Kael?\"\nArin gave a sour laugh. \"Do you think they will understand? Tharros would view it as betrayal. Kael never looked at me the same way again. \"And you-\" Her voice cracked. \"You're the only one I thought might listen.\"\nSophia's chest tightened. She wanted to shout and lash out at the unfairness of it all. But underlying the rage came something else: empathy. She could see the weight Arin carried, the years of shame engraved into every wrinkle of her face.\n\"Arin,\" Sophia said softly, \"you made a terrible mistake. But you aren't that person anymore.\"\nArin's eyes widened, a glimmer of hope piercing her misery. \"You believe me?\"\n\"I do,\" Sophia replied firmly. \"But this is something we cannot keep to ourselves. Tharros and Kael should know.\"\nArin's face hardened. \"If they find out, they will kick me out-or worse. Do you know what that means? I've worked too hard to make a home here. \"I can't lose it.\"\nSophia hesitated, divided between her allegiance to her colleagues and the link she was establishing with Arin. \"You mentioned that you wished to atone. \"That begins with honesty.\"\nArin's shoulders dropped, the fight drained from her. \"I don't know if I have the strength to face them.\"\nSophia placed a hand on Arin's arm to ground her. \"You don't need to face them alone. \"We will do it together.\"\nArin appeared on the edge of breaking, her control dissolving. But then she straightened, her normal determination returning to her posture. \"Thanks, Sophia. For listening. \"For not turning your back on me.\"\nSophia nodded, but the weight of the confession hung heavy between them. \"We will figure it out. But for now, we must concentrate on the Leviathan. Whatever happens next, we'll face it together.\nAs they left the room, the corridors were strangely calm, the previous pandemonium replaced by an oppressive stillness. Sophia's thoughts raced with questions, doubts, and the gravity of the task ahead.\nArin stopped at the intersection, her attention riveted on the shadows ahead. \"Sophia,\" she continued quietly, \"there's one more thing.\"\nSophia turned as her gut tightened. \"What is it?\"\nArin hesitated before saying, \"The Leviathan... it's drawn to me.\" The magic that created it-my magic-is still present. If it finds me, it will attempt to utilize me.\nSophia's blood became chilly. \"What does that mean?\"\n\"It means I'm a liability,\" Arin explained, her tone harsh. \"And if it comes down to it... you might have to choose between saving me or saving Aquaria.\"\nSophia looked at her, the weight of her words crushing down like a tidal wave. Before she could react, the Leviathan's distant roar resonated throughout the city, rattling the walls and sending a new flood of horror through her veins.\nThe choice Arin mentioned was no longer hypothetical. It was coming. And it was coming quickly.\nThe Shadow's Reach\nThe Leviathan's roar resonated across Aquaria, rattling the crystal walls and causing waves on every bioluminescent surface. Sophia stood motionless, her heart beating as she exchanged glances with Arin. There was no time to consider what had just been presented. The shadow was pressing in, and the city was far from prepared.\nKael emerged in the corridor, his imposing appearance belied the storm rising behind his eyes. \"The outer settlements,\" he continued forcefully, \"we've lost contact with three of them.\"\nSophia's stomach sank. \"How long ago?\"\n\"Hours,\" Kael said. \"Patrols sent to investigate haven't returned.\"\nTharros joined them, his golden eyes as steely as steel. \"The Leviathan's corruption is spreading quicker than we expected. It's not just the settlements; it's also the creatures.\n\"What do you mean?\" Sophia inquired, her voice wavering.\nTharros paused, then nodded to Kael. The warrior clinched his jaw as he motioned for them to follow. They went hurriedly down the winding halls, the Leviathan's massive presence pushing down with each stride.\nThe chamber Kael brought them to was darkly lighted and filled with anxiety. In the center, a gigantic tank contained what appeared to be a monstrous fusion of sea life. Its shape was hideous, with rotting scales and unnaturally bright eyes. The thing struggled weakly, its movements unpredictable and disturbing.\n\"This is what we're dealing with,\" Kael explained coldly. \"It was one of ours, a sentinel eel bred to protect the trenches. \"Now look at it.\"\nSophia approached the tank with caution, her heart aching at the sight. \"The corruption did this?\"\nKael nodded. \"And it is not isolated. There are reports of similar alterations in the surrounding regions.\"\nTharros crossed his arms, his visage a mask of controlled rage. \"This is exactly what the Leviathan wants: to destabilize us and turn our own defenses against us. \"If it gets to the capital...\"\n\"It won't,\" Sophia said, her tone stern. \"We won't let it.\"\nKael raised an eyebrow, doubt flaring in his eyes. \"And how exactly do you plan to stop something we can't even track?\"",

        "content": "Sophia straightened, her thoughts racing. \"We need better surveillance. The systems you're utilizing are obsolete. I've worked with surface technologies that could help us track the spread and potentially predict its next moves.\"\nThere was a tense quiet after she finished speaking. Tharros was the first to speak. \"You're suggesting we rely on the surface world?\"\nSophia met his stare unflinchingly. \"I propose that we employ every resource we have. The Leviathan is unconcerned about borders or traditions. \"If we do not adapt, we will be overrun.\"\nWhen they arrived, the council chamber was in turmoil. The collapse of the outer settlements sparked alarm and discontent among the commanders. The room was alive with overlapping voices, each more furious than the last.\n\"We should fortify the capital!\" one council member exclaimed.\n\"And abandon the settlements?\" Another responded. \"That's madness!\"\nSophia stepped forward, her voice breaking through the background commotion. \"If we keep fighting each other, the Leviathan will win without lifting a finger.\"\nEveryone looked at her. Some were suspicious, some overtly antagonistic, but Sophia persisted. \"Corruption is spreading because we don't see it coming. If we wish to protect Aquaria, we must track it. I can assist, but we will require surface technology to do so.\nThe chamber exploded again, with council members debating the advantages and dangers of Sophia's idea. Tharros lifted his hand, and the chamber became hushed. \"Let her speak.\"\nSophia looked at him, appreciation shining in her eyes, before continuing. \"We're up against an opponent unlike anything we've seen before. Our current tools are inadequate. Surface technology can provide us with the information we need to map the corruption, analyze its patterns, and respond before it spreads further.\"\nA murmur sounded throughout the council. \"And what's the cost?\" one member inquired. \"What happens when the surface world learns of our existence?\"\n\"We can control what information is shared,\" Sophia argued. \"It's not about exposing Aquaria. \"It's about survival.\"\nAnother voice joined in, dripping with contempt. \"You speak as if you understand our world, surface dweller.\" However, your allegiance to the land remains strong.\"\nTharros moved forward, his presence commanding. \"Sophia's loyalty is to Aquaria. She has demonstrated this time and again. If you question her intentions, you also question mine.\"\nThe chamber plunged into tight quiet. No one dared to confront Tharros directly, but the undercurrent of discontent remained obvious.\nSophia rested against the chilly coral walls of an empty corridor, exhausted after the conference. Tharros approached, his expression softening as he paused alongside her.\n\"You spoke well,\" he remarked quietly.\nShe gave a sour laugh. \"Did I? \"Half the council still considers me an outsider.\"\n\"They'll come around,\" Tharros stated. \"They always do.\" \"Fear makes people resistant to change.\"\nSophia turned to face him, her frustration rising to the surface. \"We do not have time for them to 'come around,' Tharros. \"The Leviathan isn't waiting for us to put our act together.\"\nHis eyes clouded, but he nodded. \"You're correct. That is why I will approve the use of surface technology. With or without the council's complete support.\"\nSophia blinked with amazement. \"You're willing to risk that?\"\nTharros' lips curved into a slight smile. \"For Aquaria? \"I am willing to take any risk.\"\nThe encounter was cut short when Kael arrived, his demeanor somber. \"We have found one of the missing patrols. What's remained of them?\"\nSophia's stomach twisted. \"Where?\"\n\"Near the ruins of Marillon,\" Kael explained. \"Corruption has already taken hold. \"If we're going to test this surface technology, we have to start there.\"\nThe ride to Marillon was stressful, with the weight of what they may discover looming over them. Sophia sat in the transport cabin, her thoughts racing with possibilities and doubts. Tharros was by her side, and his steady presence provided comfort. Kael, on the other hand, remained detached, his attention fixated on the next assignment.\nWhen they arrived, the scene was worse than Sophia had anticipated. The once-thriving settlement now a dismal wasteland, with its coral structures charred and disintegrating. The water was thick with an odd haze, and the faint glimmer of corrupted creatures flickered in the darkness.\n\"We're too late,\" Kael mumbled, his voice full of defeat.\nSophia shakes her head. \"No. We can still learn from this.\"\nShe pulled out a little instrument she'd sneaked from the surface: a sophisticated scanner capable of measuring energy signatures. Tharros looked intently as she turned it on, the device generating a gentle hum.\nSophia proceeded cautiously among the wreckage, the scanner's readout showing patterns of corruption. \"It's worse than I thought,\" she mumbled. \"The spread is not random. It is focusing on critical points, such as energy nodes and places of power.\nKael joined her, his cynicism turning to curiosity. \"You think it's deliberate?\"\nSophia nodded. \"The Leviathan doesn't only assault; it also consumes. \"Feeding on the magic that keeps Aquaria alive.\"\nTharros' voice was harsh. \"Then we need to stop it before it reaches the capital.\"\nBefore anyone could answer, a deep growl reverberated across the ruin. Sophia froze, her pulse beating as she searched the shadows. A enormous, twisted beast appeared, its body writhing with corruption.\nKael drew his sword, moving fluidly and precisely. \"Stay behind me.\"\nThe beast lunged, and chaos ensued. Kael and Tharros fought with precise coordination, their attacks quick and merciless. Sophia concentrated on the scanner, her fingers moving over the knobs as she attempted to record the creature's energy patterns.\nArin's voice crackled through the communications. \"Get out there. Now.\"\n\"We're not done!\" Sophia shot back.\n\"You will be if that thing kills you,\" Arin responded.\nKael and Tharros defeated the beast with one final, coordinated assault. But the victory seemed hollow as other growls echoed in the distance.\n\"We're leaving,\" Tharros instructed.\nSophia hesitantly followed, her scanner still glowing with information. As they retreated, the remains of Marillon appeared to watch them, a terrible warning of what would happen if they failed.\nBack in the capital, the anxiety was apparent. Sophia evaluated the information she had gathered, her mind racing with possibilities. Tharros stood behind her, calm and soothing.\n\"You did well,\" he remarked.\nSophia shakes her head. \"That's not enough. \"We need more time.\"\n\"We don't have time,\" Kael stated as he entered the room. \"The Leviathan's reach is expanding faster than we can contain it. We need a plan right now.\"\nSophia gazed at both guys, the weight of their trust resting on her shoulders. \"Then let's make one. Together.\"\nBut even as she spoke, a dark shadow moved across the city, its presence tangible. The Leviathan was closer than they had thought.\nThe Betrayal Unveiled\nKael stood at the edge of the training fields, his sharp gaze surveying the rows of troops getting ready for the day's drill. The tension in the air was oppressive, and his instincts were sharpened to detect the slightest hint of betrayal. Today would determine everything.\nThe names on the list he'd discovered had been haunting him for days. He'd studied their actions, seen their subtle signals during meetings, and saw how their gaze stayed on him for too long. The betrayal was no longer a matter of \"if\" but \"when.\" And Kael planned to strike before they could.\n\"Are you sure about this?\" Sophia's words interrupted his thoughts. She stood behind him, her presence unwavering despite the tempest raging around them.\nKael's jaws constricted. \"I don't have a choice.\"\nSophia rested a hand on his arm, her touch grounding. \"Remember, they want you to act rashly.\" Don't give them any satisfaction.\nHe looked at her with a glimmer of thanks in his stony expression. \"I'll handle it.\"\nTharros approached, his commanding presence emanating silent authority. \"Everything's in place,\" he said quietly. \"If they make a move, we'll know.\"\nKael nodded, his concentration increasing. \"Then let's begin.\"\nThe exercise started with practiced precision. Soldiers advanced in formation, generating a rhythm that echoed around the arena. Kael stared from the command station, his senses sharpened to every detail.\nIt began subtly-one soldier fumbling his weapon, another trailing behind his group. Minor blunders that could be attributed to tiredness. But Kael knew better.\n\"They're testing you,\" Sophia said softly from his side.\nHe did not respond, his gaze locked on the field. Then he noticed it: a brief exchange of glances between two officers, followed by a barely noticeable nod.\nKael's pulse quickened. \"It's happening.\"\nBefore Sophia could react, mayhem broke out.\nA blast rocked the training grounds, sending plumes of water and debris into the sky. Soldiers scattered, their shouts mingling in with the explosion's noise. Kael leaped into action, instinctively barking orders to restore order.\n\"Form up!\" He yelled, his voice cutting through the confusion. \"Secure the perimeter!\"\nHowever, the saboteurs had already made their move. Two people emerged from the commotion, with their weapons drawn and their intents obvious. Kael hardly had time to react as they lunged for him, their strikes quick and deliberate.\nHe ducked the first stroke, his sword colliding with theirs in a clatter of steel. The second attacker circled behind him, but Kael was prepared. With a quick kick, he drove the first attacker tumbling and twisted to avoid the second's sword.\nSophia watched from the sidelines, her heart racing as the fight progressed. Kael glided with lethal ease, his strikes precise and unrelenting. But the saboteurs were unrelenting, their actions motivated by desperation.\nOne of them feinted to distract Kael's attention, while the other delivered a fatal blow. Sophia's breath caught, and her voice sounded out in warning. \"Kael, behind you!\"\nHe reacted immediately, twisting and blocking the hit with his dagger. The force of the hit drove him reeling, but he recovered swiftly, smashing his elbow into his attacker's chest.\nThe fight stopped as soon as it started. Kael stepped over the dead saboteurs, his blade ready to strike, but he paused. Their faces were familiar-men he had trained and fought alongside.\n\"You should've known better,\" Kael remarked bitterly, his voice full of betrayal.\nOne of the men spat at his feet, his eyes flaming with defiance. \"You are blind, Kael. Aquaria is sinking, and you're too devoted to notice it.\"\nKael's jaw tightened, but before he could answer, Tharros came forward.\n\"Take them into custody,\" Tharros said, his voice steely. \"They'll answer for their crimes.\"\nThe aftermath was tense. Soldiers muttered amongst themselves, their anxiety evident as the saboteurs were led away. Kael stood in the center of the arena, his shoulders heavy with the weight of what had transpired.\nSophia approached slowly, speaking softly. \"Are you okay?\"\nHe did not respond right away, his gaze distant. Finally, he explained, \"They were my men. \"I trusted them.\"\nSophia's heart wrenched from the obvious agony in his voice. \"You did what you needed to do, Kael. Their decisions are not your fault.\"\nHe turned to her, his face hard but his eyes weak. \"How can I lead when I don't know who I can trust?\"\n\"You start with the ones who've proven themselves,\" she stated firmly. Like Tharros. \"Like me.\"\nKael observed her, his posture relaxed slightly. \"You're not making this easy.\"\nSophia smiled slightly. \"I'm not supposed to.\"\nLater, in the council room, the tone was dismal. The revelation of the traitors had sent shockwaves through Aquaria's leadership, forcing everyone to confront the fragility of their union.\n\"We can't ignore this,\" Tharros insisted, his voice steady but stern. \"The corruption isn't just outside our walls-it's within them.\"\nOne of the council members bristled. \"Are you saying that we begin scrutinizing everyone's loyalty? \"That is a dangerous path, Tharros.\"\nSophia stepped forward, her voice calm but firm. \"We don't need to turn against each other. What we need is transparency and accountability. \"Secrets and paranoia will only weaken us.\"\nThe council muttered in agreement, but the tension remained high.\nTharros looked at Sophia with admiration in his eyes. \"Wise words.\"\nKael, seated next to him, nodded unwillingly. \"She's correct. We must focus on repairing trust, not ripping it apart.\"\nSophia felt a glimmer of hope as she looked around the room. Despite the fractures, there was still an opportunity to repair what had been shattered.\nSophia lingered in the chamber after the meeting, her mind heavy. Kael approached her, his expression opaque.\n\"Thank you,\" he replied after a time.\n\"For what?\"\n\"For keeping me grounded,\" he said. \"I was ready to lose control out there.\"\nSophia smiled softly. \"That's what friends are for.\"\nKael stopped before adding, \"You're more than that, Sophia. To everyone of us.\"\nHer pulse skipped a beat, but before she could react, a messenger entered the room, his face pallid.\n\"Sire,\" the messenger exclaimed breathlessly, addressing Tharros as he reentered. \"There's been another attack-this time in the capital.\"\nTharros' expression clouded. \"Where?\"\n\"The council's archives,\" the messenger answered. \"They've been burned.\"\nAs the enormity of the situation dawned on everyone, the room became silent.\nSophia's voice was hardly audible. \"They're trying to erase something.\"\nKael clinched his hands. \"Or someone.\"\nTharros' golden gaze shone with purpose. \"It's not over. Definitely not.\"\nThe weight of his words hung in the air, a grim reminder of the battles to come.\nA Fragile Alliance\nThe council chamber was filled with anxiety. The Shark Clans had issued an ultimatum: either cease the unrest in Aquaria or lose their allegiance. The threat could not have arrived at a worse time for a monarchy that was already on the verge of collapse.\nTharros paced at the front of the room, his irritation barely hidden. \"We cannot afford to lose their support. Aquaria will not have a chance if the Leviathan attacks while we are split.\nKael leaned against the wall with his arms crossed. \"Yet they're seizing this opportunity to demonstrate their dominance. Typical.\"\nSophia sat quietly, her thoughts whirling as she absorbed the conversation. The Shark Clans had always been an unexpected ally, their devotion based on power and respect. Aquaria's current volatility has given them reason to question both.\n\"They won't listen to threats or pleas,\" Sophia finally replied, her voice breaking through the growing debate. \"We need to meet them on their terms.\"\nTharros stopped pacing, his golden eyes narrowing. \"And how do you suggest we do that?\"\n\"Let me speak to them,\" Sophia said.\nKael straightened, suspicion engraved on his face. \"Do you believe they will listen to you? They scarcely tolerate us, and you are a surface dweller.\"\nSophia met his gaze evenly. \"That's exactly why I think I have a chance. They will not expect me to understand them. This provides us an advantage.\nTharros pondered her words, the weight of leadership resting heavily on his large shoulders. Eventually, he nodded. \"You will have our complete support. But be careful, Sophia. The Shark Clans value strength but loathe weakness.\nThe journey to Shark Clan territory was stressful. Their habitat was the jagged reefs that surrounded the abyssal trenches, a perilous maze of razor-sharp coral and predatory currents. The transport craft glided cautiously over the waves, its crew remaining silent as they approached the heavily guarded entrance.\nSophia stood at the helm, her heart racing as the Shark Clan sentries swam alongside the ship, their sleek shapes slashing through the water like blades. Their lord, Lord Tyros, awaited her in the ceremonial room.\nKael joined her as they disembarked, his presence a combination of protective instinct and mistrust. \"Are you sure about this?\" he inquired calmly.\nSophia looked at him, her face calm despite her nervousness. \"No. \"But I'm doing it anyway.\"\nThe ceremonial chamber was as impressive as its residents. Walls of jagged coral sparkled under the bioluminescent light, and the water had a subtle tang of salt and iron. Lord Tyros sat in the center, his huge form emanating authority and danger. His harsh, toothy grin was far from welcoming.",

        "content": "\"Sophia Rodriguez,\" Tyros drawled, his voice a low rumble that seemed to resonate through the sea. \"The surface dweller became an Aquarian diplomat. What do we owe this... honor?\nSophia moved forward, disregarding the taunt. \"I'm here to protect the relationship between Aquaria and the Shark Clans. We cannot afford to allow our differences divide us.\nTyros leaned back, his sharp eyes gleaming with delight. \"Differences? That's putting it lightly. Your realm reeks of weakness. Betrayal, corruption, and now the Leviathan is prowling your boundaries. Why should we bind our fate to yours?\nThe council members flanking him murmured in agreement, their faces chilly.\nSophia took a big breath. \"Because the Leviathan threatens all of us, including Aquaria. You've seen how corruption spreads. It will not stop at our boundaries, but will consume everything in its path. \"If we stand divided, we will fall.\"\nTyros chuckled grimly. \"Girl, spare me the speeches. What do you have to give that is worth compromising my clan's survival?\"\nSophia met his stare unflinchingly. \"Respect. Recognition. The Shark Clans have always been considered outliers, feared rather than understood. That changes today. If you stand with us, you will have a place at the table and a say in Aquaria's decisions.\nTyros' grin vanished, replaced by a calculating expression. \"These are bold words. However, words alone do not have weight in my society. \"Prove that you are worthy of our loyalty.\"\nSophia hesitated, detecting a challenge in his words. \"What do you want me to do?\"\nTyros rose, his huge body throwing a shadow throughout the chamber. \"This is a test. You'll enter the Abyssal Pass to retrieve a shard from the Leviathan's trench. Only then will I evaluate your offer.\"\nThe council mumbled in astonishment, with some dubious and others fascinated.\nKael moved forward, his voice harsh. \"That is lunacy. She's not a warrior, and you know it.\"\nTyros' grin returned, razor-sharp. \"If she's not strong enough to face the abyss, why should we trust her to face the Leviathan?\"\nSophia placed a hand on Kael's arm, halting his outcry. \"I'll do it.\"\nKael looked to her, disbelief in his eyes. \"Sophia-\"\n\"I said I'd do it,\" she stated firmly. \"This is our greatest opportunity of securing their alliance. I will not let it slip away.\"\nSophia had never seen anything like the Abyssal Pass before. The water was thick with shadows, and the pressure was intense as they plunged into the trench. Her suit's bioluminescent threads provided the sole light in the stifling blackness.\nKael swam beside her, his protective impulses competing with his admiration for her tenacity. \"Stay close,\" he muttered. \"The currents down here are treacherous.\"\nSophia nodded, her gaze fixed on the task ahead. The trench seemed to throb with an unnerving energy, with faint whispers of the Leviathan's depravity creeping around the borders of her thoughts.\nThey discovered the shard lodged in a rough crag, its surface glowing with an unearthly light. Sophia grabbed for it gingerly, her fingers brushing over the cool surface.\nWhen she touched it, she felt a sharp and invasive pulse of electricity go through her. She gasped, her vision blurring as the Leviathan's presence flickered on the outside of her awareness.\n\"Sophia!\" Kael's words drew her back, and his firm grip anchored her as she staggered.\n\"I'm fine,\" she replied hastily, her shaking hands betraying her.\nThey emerged shortly later, the shard safely secured. Tyros awaited them, his countenance opaque as Sophia displayed the artifact.\n\"Well done,\" he remarked with an unwillingly courteous tone. \"You've proven your strength.\"\nSophia met his gaze and kept her voice calm. \"Does this mean we have your support?\"\nTyros watched her for a long time before nodding. \"The Shark Clans will respect the partnership. But know this: if Aquaria falls, we will not join her.\nAs word of the revitalized deal filtered throughout the capital, tensions lessened. Sophia sat in the council chamber, tiredness pouring through her bones.\nAs Kael approached, his typically steely manner softened. \"You surprised me today,\" he confessed.\nSophia smiled slightly. \"Is that a compliment?\"\n\"Take it however you want,\" he said with a tinge of humor. Then, more seriously, he said, \"You've earned their respect-and mine.\" But don't let it get to your head.\nSophia chuckled, and the weight of the day lifted slightly. \"Do not worry, Kael. There's plenty to keep me anchored.\"\nAs they had a rare moment of understanding, a tiny tremor shook the chamber, with the distant roar of the Leviathan serving as a dismal reminder.\nThe tenuous alliance had been strengthened, but the war was far from done.\nA Test of Loyalty\nThe training fields were alive with anxiety as Aquaria's soldiers stood in formation, their movements precise yet stiff. Across from them, the Shark Clans gathered, their sleek bodies and piercing eyes exuding predatory confidence. The currents between the two groups appeared electric, with each side brimming with unspoken distrust.\nTharros stood in the center, his golden gaze sweeping across the gathering soldiers. \"Today's about more than drills,\" he declared, his voice dominating. \"The Leviathan's shadow falls over us all. If we're going to survive, we need to learn to trust one other.\"\nSophia stood right behind him, her presence unwavering despite the unsettling crackling in the water. She'd spent hours resolving conflicts, settling tempers, and ensuring that this exercise didn't become derailed before it started. But as she looked at the stiff lines of Aquaria's warriors and the frantic motions of the Shark Clans, she knew this would be far from easy.\nKael approached her with an inscrutable gaze. \"Think this will work?\"\n\"It has to,\" Sophia said, her voice quiet but forceful. \"We don't have another option.\"\nThe first portion of the drill included simulated warfare scenarios. Aquarian soldiers were matched with Shark Clan warriors, their movements uncomfortable as they attempted to synchronize. The Shark Clans valued speed and unpredictability, but Aquaria's warriors emphasized strategy and precision. It was a collision of styles, and cracks appeared rapidly.\n\"Keep up, surface crawler!\" exclaimed a Shark Clan warrior as his comrade fell behind during a sprint exercise.\n\"Maybe if you followed the plan instead of charging ahead!\" The soldier shot back, his frustration evident.\nSophia moved between them, her voice gentle yet firm. \"Enough. This is not about establishing who is superior. Concentrate on the goal.\"\nThe two hesitantly returned to line, their wrath barely restrained.\nKael watched from the sidelines, arms crossed. \"They're not ready for this.\"\n\"They will be,\" Sophia insisted, refusing to let doubt seep in. \"They just need time.\"\nArin watched the drill from a distance, her keen eyes scanning the participants. She wasn't here to train or mediate; her emphasis was on something considerably more sinister.\nThe Leviathan's influence has a way of hiding in plain sight-tiny signals and subtle shifts that might easily be overlooked. A moment of pause, an unexpected movement, and a shadow in the eyes. Arin's power buzzed softly around her, a whispering line of energy seeking out the supernatural.\nShe noticed one soldier moving strangely, his eyes darting rapidly as if he was seeing something no one else could. Arin pushed his lips into a thin line. Another promising lead.\nBy midday, emotions had reached a boiling point. During a practice combat, an Aquarian officer and a Shark Clan commander got into a heated dispute that quickly escalated.\n\"You're reckless!\" The officer snapped. \"Your wild tactics nearly got my men injured!\"\n\"And your rigid rules are a liability!\" the Shark leader responded.\nTharros stepped forward, his towering stature drowned out the conversation. \"Enough,\" he exclaimed, his voice as cold as steel. \"It is not about egos or grudges. You're here to learn how to work together, not against each other.\"\nSophia moved to his side, her calm tone easing the severity of his scolding. \"We all want the same thing: to survive. The Leviathan does not care about our differences. \"If we don't learn to trust one another, we're handing it victory.\"\nThe words hung in the water, offering a quiet yet powerful challenge. Slowly, the two leaders nodded, their pride hurt but their tempers under control.\nThe corrupted creatures attacked, which marked a turning point.\nIt began with a faraway tremor, a little change in the water that sent shivers down Sophia's spine. Then the first creature appeared: a gigantic eel, warped by the Leviathan's corruption, its formerly elegant form now bloated and hideous.\nA second followed, then a third, until the water was alive with activity. The beasts invaded the training fields, their blazing eyes and snapping jaws dispersing soldiers.\n\"Form up!\" Kael screamed, his voice cutting through the confusion.\nAquaria's troops took up defensive positions, their spears and shields up. The Shark Clans joined them, moving fluidly as they prepared to strike. For a little while, the two groups paused, the mistrust still present.\n\"Together!\" Sophia shouted, her voice full of urgency. \"We fight together, or we fall!\"\nHer words energized them. With a common battle cry, the two forces charged.\nThe combat was violent and chaotic, with corrupted monsters relentlessly attacking. Aquarian soldiers and Shark Clan warriors fought together, their differences forgotten in the face of a common adversary.\nKael moved like a tornado, his spear striking with deadly accuracy. Beside him, a Shark Clan leader leaped at a beast, and their combined efforts killed it in a spray of blackened ichor.\nSophia worked furiously to coordinate the defense, her voice cutting through the clamor as she conveyed instructions. \"Hold the line!\" \"Protect the injured.\"\nArin remained on the perimeter, her magic sizzling and sending waves of energy to disturb the creatures' movements. But her attention remained fixed on the soldiers, her acute gaze searching for any signs of corruption among them.\nA soldier collapsed, and his scream pierced the chaos. Sophia ran to his side, her pulse racing as she struggled to bring him to safety. A Shark Clan warrior appeared beside her, his powerful form sheltering them as he defeated an approaching beast.\n\"Thanks,\" Sophia exclaimed.\nThe warrior grinned, his sharp fangs gleaming. \"Don't mention it, surface dweller.\"\nA profound hush descended over the training grounds as the final beast fell. The water was thick with the residue of fighting, leaving the once-pristine landscape scarred and damaged.\nSophia remained in the center, her chest heaving as she peered about. Soldiers and Shark Clan warriors assisted each other to their feet, their common suffering forming a kinship deeper than words could.\nTharros approached, his face bleak but determined. \"We have demonstrated that we can fight together. Now we must guarantee that we are prepared for the actual struggle.\nKael nodded, his typical skepticism replaced by a look of admiration. \"They've earned it today.\"\nSophia caught his gaze, her tiredness offset by a tiny smile. \"Even the surface dweller?\"\nKael snorted, a rare moment of levity emerging. \"Even you.\"\nAs the soldiers gathered, Arin grabbed Sophia aside and spoke quietly. \"There's something you need to see.\"\nShe took Sophia to the edge of the training fields, where a soldier stood terrified. His eyes were glazed, and his fists gripped his weapon fiercely.\n\"It's starting,\" Arin remarked solemnly.",

        "content": "Sophia's heart fell. The Leviathan's corruption was not limited to the creatures. It was seeping into the people.\n\"Does Tharros know?\" Sophia asked.\n\"Not yet,\" Arin responded. \"But he will soon.\"\nSophia's expression hardened as she returned her focus to the soldiers and Shark Clan fighters, their fragile union a ray of light in the middle of the rising gloom.\nThe Leviathan's shadow was growing, as was their might.\nFor the time being, that should enough.\nEchoes of the Past\nThe chamber deep beneath Aquaria's palace was cold and quiet, the air thick with the weight of forgotten information. Crystals embedded in the walls pulsed faintly, casting an eerie glow over the old texts spread across the stone table before Sophia.\nArin stood close, her arms crossed and her expression guarded. \"You're certain you want to do this?\"\nSophia didn't look up, her attention locked on the intricate symbols etched into the aged parchment. \"If there's a chance this prophecy can help us understand the Leviathan-and stop it-I have to.\"\nArin paused, her normal sharpness dulled by something softer, almost vulnerable. \"These texts aren't just stories, Sophia. They're warnings.\"\nSophia looked at her, her determination unwavering. \"Warnings are only helpful if we understand them.\"\nWith a reluctant sigh, Arin stepped closer, her fingers brushing over the fading markings. \"Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you.\"\nThe text was ancient, its language a mix of flowing symbols and fractured sentences that seemed to shift under the faint light. Sophia traced the words with careful precision, her analytical mind piecing together bits of meaning.\n\"'The Four Who Must Unite to Heal the Abyss,'\" she read aloud, her voice quiet but steady. \"It's mentioned here, over and over.\"\nArin leaned over her shoulder, her face tightening. \"The Four,\" she repeated, her tone heavy with dread. \"It's always been interpreted as a metaphor. Four elements, four supports, four forces. But\"\nSophia finished her thought. \"But what if it's literal?\"\nThe words hung between them, weighted with implications neither wanted to speak.\n\"It mentions unity,\" Arin said, her fingers brushing a section of text. \"But not just any kind. A bond stronger than blood or magic. Something... absolute.\"\nSophia frowned, her mind racing. \"A bond like ours.\"\nArin's silence was answer enough.\nAs they dug deeper into the text, more details emerged. The prophecy spoke of an old balance disturbed, a rift in the ocean's fabric that had allowed the Leviathan's corruption to fester. The only way to restore harmony was for \"The Four\" to unite-not just in goal, but in essence.\n\"What does that even mean?\" Sophia asked, frustration creeping into her voice.\nArin's unease increased. \"It could mean anything. A shared power, a merging of magic, or...\"\n\"Or something we're not prepared for,\" Sophia finished, her chest tightening at the thought.\nArin nodded, her gaze distant. \"The ocean's magic doesn't give without taking. Whatever this prophecy demands, it will cost us.\"\nSophia looked at her, the weight of the revelation settling heavily between them. \"Do you think we can do it?\"\nArin's lips pressed into a thin line. \"I think we don't have a choice.\"\nThe find left Sophia restless. She paced her quarters later that evening, the words of the prophecy echoing in her mind. \"A bond deeper than magic.\" What did that mean for her relationship with Tharros, Kael, and Arin? They were already connected in ways she hadn't fully understood-was that enough?\nA soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts. \"Come in,\" she called.\nKael stepped inside, his presence filling the room with an air of quiet strength. \"You've been hiding down there all day. What's going on?\"\nSophia hesitated, unsure how much to share. \"I've been researching the prophecy. Arin and I found something important.\"\nKael raised an eyebrow, his sharp gaze studying her. \"Important how?\"\nShe hesitated, then said, \"It mentions us. All four of us.\"\nKael frowned, crossing his arms. \"I'm guessing it's not good news.\"\n\"It's complicated,\" Sophia admitted. \"The prophecy says we're key to stopping the Leviathan. But it also says the bond between us has to be absolute.\"\nKael's expression softened slightly, though his concern remained. \"And what does that mean?\"\n\"That's the problem,\" Sophia said, her voice tinged with frustration. \"We don't know yet. But whatever it is, it's going to require more than we've given so far.\"\nKael nodded slowly, his jaw tightening. \"Then we give it. Whatever it takes.\"\nHis certainty steadied her, even as the uncertainty of what lay ahead loomed large.\nThe next morning, Sophia met Arin in the study chamber again, her resolve firmer. \"We need to tell Tharros.\"\nArin stiffened. \"Not yet. We don't have enough answers.\"\n\"We have enough to know this is bigger than us,\" Sophia argued. \"Keeping it from him won't help.\"\nArin's gaze darkened. \"And what happens when he learns the cost? What happens when Kael does?\"\nSophia didn't flinch. \"We face it together. That's what the prophecy says, isn't it? Unity. We can't have that if we keep secrets.\"\nArin sighed, her shoulders dropping slightly. \"You're relentless, you know that?\"\nSophia offered a faint smile. \"So I've been told.\"\nLater that day, the group gathered in the council chamber. Tharros stood at the head of the table, his dominating presence steady as always. Kael leaned against the wall, his sharp look sweeping the room. Arin lingered in the shadows, her unease barely disguised.\nSophia took a deep breath, then began. \"We've uncovered something about the prophecy. Something important.\"\nShe outlined what she and Arin had found, her voice steady despite the tension in the room. When she finished, the quiet was deafening.\nTharros was the first to speak. \"So we're the Four. And this link is the key to defeating the Leviathan.\"\nSophia nodded. \"That's what the prophecy suggests.\"\nKael frowned. \"And what's the catch?\"\nArin's speech was quiet but sharp. \"The catch is that magic never gives without taking. Whatever this bond asks, it won't be easy.\"\nTharros's eyes hardened. \"It doesn't matter. If this is what's needed, we'll do it.\"\nSophia looked at him, her chest tightening at his confidence. \"Even if it means-\"\n\"Even if it means everything,\" Tharros interrupted, his voice strong.\nKael nodded, his face resolute. \"We've come too far to back down now.\"\nArin glanced between them, her discomfort clear. \"Just remember, once we start down this path, there's no going back.\"\nSophia met her look, determination blazing in her eyes. \"We've already crossed that line, Arin. All we can do now is move forward.\"\nAs the meeting finished, Sophia lingered in the chamber, her thoughts racing. She felt the weight of the prophecy pressing down on her, the enormity of what they were about to attempt.\nTharros approached her, his golden eyes steady. \"You've done well, Sophia. You've brought us this far.\"\nShe shook her head. \"This isn't just about me. It's about all of us.\"\nHe put a hand on her shoulder, his touch grounding. \"And together, we'll face whatever comes next.\"\nSophia nodded, but her thoughts stayed heavy. The echoes of the prophecy remained in her thoughts, a haunting reminder of the challenges ahead.\nAs she left the chamber, the faint vibration of the Leviathan's presence rippled through the water-a grim warning that time was running out.\nThe Storm Within\nThe council room was silent except for the faint hum of the bioluminescent crystals lining the walls. Tension rippled through the water as Tharros stood at the head of the table, his golden eyes steady but simmering with anger. Across from him, Kael leaned forward, his fists planted on the table and his words sharp.\n\"We can't afford to wait any longer,\" Kael said, his tone tight with barely controlled rage. \"The Leviathan's corruption is spreading. Every second we delay, more lives are lost, and its power grows.\"\nTharros's eyes didn't waver. \"Charging into battle without preparation will only ensure more casualties. Our barriers are not ready. If the Leviathan hits while we're exposed, Aquaria will fall.\"\nKael straightened, his stance rigid. \"And what happens if we sit idle? How many more villages will be overrun while we hide behind these walls?\"\n\"It's not hiding,\" Tharros said, his voice low and dangerous. \"It's strategy.\"\nKael scoffed, his anger flaring. \"Call it what you want, but it's cowardice.\"\nThe words hit like a thunderclap, and the room exploded into murmurs. The council members traded uneasy glances, their discomfort palpable as the two most powerful figures in Aquaria clashed.\nSophia stood at the edge of the chamber, her chest tightening as she watched the fight spiral. She could see the strain on both of them-the weight of their choices etched into every word, every movement. But the anger between them was a fissure that could shatter the shaky unity they'd worked so hard to build.\n\"Enough!\" Sophia's words cut through the noise, sharp and commanding.\nAll eyes turned to her. Tharros and Kael froze, their gazes locking onto her with a mix of surprise and defiance.\nShe stepped forward, her face calm but unyielding. \"This isn't helping anyone. We're fighting each other when the real threat is out there, getting stronger by the minute.\"\nKael's jaw tensed. \"Do you have a better plan, Sophia? Because right now, talking isn't going to stop the Leviathan.\"\n\"I don't have all the answers,\" she allowed, her tone steady. \"But I do know that dividing ourselves only makes us weaker. You're both right, and you're both wrong.\"\nTharros frowned, his frustration obvious. \"Explain.\"\nSophia met his eyes, then turned to Kael. \"Kael's right that we can't ignore the Leviathan's advance. But rushing in without a clear plan will play right into its hands. And Tharros is right that we need to be prepared-but readiness doesn't mean inaction. We need to strike a balance.\"\nKael crossed his arms, his eyes sharpening. \"And how do you suggest we do that?\"\nSophia took a deep breath, her mind whirling. \"We fortify the capital while simultaneously deploying small, agile teams to monitor and counter the Leviathan's spread. Strike where it's weakest, but don't overextend ourselves. Use the Shark Clans to cover places we can't reach quickly.\"\nTharros considered her words, his golden eyes thoughtful. \"It's risky. Spreading our forces thin leaves us vulnerable.\"\nSophia nodded. \"It's a risk, but it's better than doing nothing or throwing everything at an enemy we don't fully understand. We can't win if we're not united.\"\nKael exhaled quickly, the tension in his posture easing slightly. \"Fine. But we act now. No more delays.\"\nTharros's face softened, the storm in his gaze dissipating. \"Agreed.\"\nThe council murmured in satisfaction as the two men reached a tentative truce.\nLater, Sophia found herself walking the quiet hallways of the palace, her thoughts heavy. The argument had been resolved, but the strain remained. She could feel it in the way Kael had stalked out of the room and the quiet tension in Tharros's movements.\nShe wasn't surprised when she found Kael in the training hall, his spear slicing through the water in precise, furious motions.\n\"Pushing yourself too hard won't help,\" Sophia said gently, leaning against the wall.\nKael stopped, his chest heaving as he turned to face her. \"I don't have time to slow down.\"\nSophia stepped closer, her eyes steady. \"No one's questioning your dedication, Kael. But this isn't just about the Leviathan, is it?\"\nKael's jaw tightened, his silence saying volumes.\n\"You feel like you're failing them,\" Sophia said softly. \"The soldiers, the people. Even Tharros.\"\nHis hands clenched around his weapon. \"It's my job to protect them. Every day we wait, I'm aware of what I couldn't stop. What I couldn't save.\"\nSophia reached out, putting a hand on his arm. \"You're not alone in this. We all carry that weight. But beating yourself up won't make you stronger-it'll break you.\"\nKael met her stare, the vulnerability in his eyes stark against his usual stoicism. \"You don't understand what it's like to be responsible for so many lives.\"\nSophia's speech was quiet but firm. \"You're right, I don't. But I know what it's like to feel like you're not enough. And I know you're stronger than you think.\"\nFor a moment, Kael said nothing. Then he nodded, a faint flicker of gratitude in his face. \"Thanks.\"\nTharros, meanwhile, was in the war room, his hands braced against the table as he studied the maps and files spread before him. The weight of leadership pressed heavily on his shoulders, the lines of stress etched deeply into his face.\nSophia entered quietly, her presence drawing his attention.\n\"You're still here,\" Tharros said, his voice tired but warm.\n\"I could say the same to you,\" she responded, her tone light.\nHe smiled faintly, then sighed. \"Kael's right about one thing-we can't afford to make mistakes. Every choice feels like a gamble.\"\nSophia stepped closer, her eyes soft. \"That's what leadership is, isn't it? Balancing the impossible.\"\nTharros chuckled softly, the sound laced with tiredness. \"And here I thought being a dragon king would make things simpler.\"\nSophia smiled, the tension between them lessening. \"You're doing better than you think, Tharros. You just need to trust yourself-and the people around you.\"\nHe looked at her, something unspoken passing between them. \"It's not easy, you know. Trusting. But you've made it easier.\"\nSophia felt a warmth grow in her chest at his words. \"That's what I'm here for.\"\nAs the night went on, the palace settled into an uneasy calm. But Sophia knew this was only the beginning. The Leviathan's shadow loomed bigger with every passing moment, and the storm within their ranks was far from over.\nStanding on the balcony overlooking the glowing city, Sophia felt the weight of her role more sharply than ever. She was the bridge between them, the thread holding their fragile union together. And as the faint vibration of the Leviathan's presence rippled through the water, she knew she would have to be stronger than ever to keep them from falling apart.\nPreparing for the Abyss\nThe first attack on Aquaria's outer villages came with little notice. Twisted creatures, their forms bloated and twisted by the Leviathan's corruption, surged through the water like a living storm. Villagers barely had time to flee before the monsters overwhelmed their homes, leaving damage in their wake.\nBy the time news reached the capital, the tension in the palace was evident. Tharros stood before the council, his voice steady despite the grim news. \"The Leviathan's influence is no longer a distant threat. It's here, at our limits. We must act swiftly.\"\nSophia sat beside him, her mind whirling. The attacks were escalating faster than she'd expected. The fragile balance they'd worked so hard to maintain was unraveling, and the final confrontation felt closer than ever.\nKael leaned forward, his face grim. \"We can't just wait for it to come to us. We need to strike back.\"\nTharros nodded. \"Agreed. But we must be smart. Rushing in unprepared will only lead to more destruction.\"\nSophia cleared her throat, drawing their attention. \"I've been working on something that could give us an edge.\"\nAll eyes turned to her, the weight of their hope and doubt pressing down like a tidal wave.\nIn the workshop beneath the palace, Sophia described her plan. A table was covered in schematics and glowing crystals, a chaotic mix of surface technology and Aquarian magic.",

        "content": "\"I've been studying the energy signatures of the corrupted creatures,\" Sophia began, referring to a glowing map. \"Their movements aren't random. They're following patterns tied to the Leviathan's impact. If we can track those patterns, we can guess where it will strike next.\"\nKael crossed his arms, his skepticism clear. \"And how do you propose we do that?\"\nSophia tapped a crystalline device linked to a surface scanner. \"By integrating this technology with Aquarian magic. The scanner detects anomalies, and the crystals amplify the signals, forming a network that maps the Leviathan's reach in real time.\"\nTharros stepped closer, studying the device. \"Have you tested it?\"\n\"Not yet,\" Sophia admitted. \"But if it works, it could give us the advantage we need.\"\nArin, standing in the darkness, finally spoke. \"You'll need more than technology to make this work. The magic needed to stabilize a network this size is... delicate.\"\nSophia turned to her, her determination steadfast. \"Then teach me. Show me what I need to do.\"\nArin's lips bent into a faint, wry smile. \"You're relentless, I'll give you that. Fine. But don't blame me if you end up regretting it.\"\nThe training began that evening in the quiet refuge of Arin's quarters. The room was dimly lit, the walls alive with glowing coral that pulsed in time with the faint hum of magic in the water.\nArin stood in the middle, her posture elegant and commanding. \"Magic isn't just about power, Sophia. It's about precision. Control. If you let it, it will consume you.\"\nSophia nodded, her hands clenched at her sides. \"I'm ready.\"\nArin raised an eyebrow, then offered her hand. A sphere of shimmering energy formed between her fingers, its light casting complex patterns across the room. \"Focus on this. Feel its beat. Magic is living, Sophia. You don't control it-you guide it.\"\nSophia closed her eyes, letting the energy's pulse wash over her. At first, it was overwhelming-a chaotic surge of power that threatened to slip through her hands. But slowly, she found the beat, her own energy aligning with it.\n\"That's it,\" Arin whispered, her voice softer now. \"You're getting there.\"\nSophia opened her eyes, a faint glow coming from her hands. The realization sent a thrill of both fear and excitement through her.\n\"Good,\" Arin said, her face unreadable. \"But this is just the beginning. If you want to stand against the Leviathan, you'll need more than simple control. You'll need mastery.\"\nWhile Sophia trained with Arin, Tharros led attempts to fortify the city. The palace grounds became a hive of activity as soldiers reinforced barriers and built defensive wards. The air was charged with urgency, every movement exact and purposeful.\nKael, meanwhile, worked on preparing an elite force of warriors. He stood in the training arena, his voice sharp as he barked directions.\n\"Faster! The Leviathan's creatures won't give you time to think-every second counts!\"\nThe warriors pushed themselves harder, their movements precise but strained under the weight of Kael's demands. He knew they disliked his relentless pace, but he couldn't afford to care. This wasn't just about readiness; it was about life.\nSophia watched from a distance as Kael demonstrated a number of advanced techniques, his spear moving like an extension of his body. His focus was absolute, his drive unyielding.\n\"You push them hard,\" she said as he approached for a short break.\nKael shrugged, his face hard. \"They need it. The Leviathan won't hold back, and neither can we.\"\nSophia put a hand on his arm, her touch grounding. \"Just remember, they're not machines. They need to believe they can win-not just fight.\"\nFor a moment, Kael's eyes softened. \"You're right. But religion won't stop a monster like that.\"\n\"No,\" Sophia admitted. \"But unity might.\"\nBy the end of the week, Sophia's tracking network was operating. The council met in the war room as the glowing map lit up with pulsating signals.\n\"It's working,\" Sophia said, a mix of relief and pride in her voice. \"We can see where the corruption is spreading-and where it's likely to strike next.\"\nTharros studied the map, his golden eyes narrowing. \"The Leviathan's movements aren't random. It's hitting key locations-places of power.\"\nKael frowned. \"Then it's trying to weaken us before it attacks.\"\nSophia nodded. \"That's why we need to act fast. If we can predict its next move, we can intercept it before it gets more ground.\"\nTharros put a hand on her shoulder, his expression calm but resolute. \"You've done well, Sophia. This gives us a fighting chance.\"\nKael crossed his arms, his eyes shifting between the map and Sophia. \"Now we just need to make sure we're ready when the time comes.\"\nArin, standing at the edge of the room, spoke quietly. \"The time is coming faster than you think.\"\nAll eyes turned to her, but she didn't expand. Her words hung in the air, a frightening reminder of the prophecy's weight.\nThat night, Sophia stood on the balcony of her rooms, the glow of the city below casting faint patterns across her face. The Leviathan's shadow loomed bigger than ever, its presence a constant pressure at the edge of her awareness.\nShe thought of Tharros's quiet strength, Kael's relentless purpose, and Arin's guarded wisdom. They were all fighting their own fights, carrying their own burdens. And yet, they were united by a fragile, unshakable link.\nThe final battle was drawing near. She could feel it in her bones.\nAs she turned to go inside, a small vibration rippled through the water-a whisper of the Leviathan's presence. Sophia's chest tightened, the weight of the forecast pressing down on her.\nWhatever came next, they would face it together.\nEchoes of Corruption\nThe Leviathan's shadow hung over Aquaria like a heavy weight, pressing down on the city's shining towers from above. Sophia could feel it deep inside the palace-a creeping unease that made her think something bad was going to happen.\n\"We've heard that there's been some strange activity near the kelp forests,\" Kael said, his voice tense. \"The sea life is leaving or changing completely because of something.\"\nArin leaned against the wall and looked at Sophia with a sharp gaze. \"We need to act right away if it has anything to do with the Leviathan.\"\nSophia nodded, feeling the weight of her duty settle on her shoulders. The new instincts she felt were at odds with her human reasoning. \"Let's go.\" \"If we're lucky, we can figure it out before it gets worse.\"\nThe trip to the kelp forest was tense, the water thick with an unnatural stillness. Even the bioluminescent corals seemed dimmer, their normal vibrancy muted by the growing corruption.\n\"Stay close,\" Kael directed, his spear at the ready. \"We don't know what's waiting for us.\"\nSophia's heart raced as they approached the outer edge of the forest. The oncethriving marine life was eerily missing, replaced by silence that seemed to amplify her every breath. She looked at Arin, who was muttering a protective incantation under her breath, the water around her fingertips shimmering faintly.\n\"Something's wrong,\" Sophia whispered, her voice barely carrying through the water.\n\"You don't say,\" Arin answered dryly, though her usual sarcasm lacked its edge.\nThen it hit them-a wave of sound so piercing it felt like needles driving into their brains. Sophia clutched her head, her vision spinning as the noise grew louder, impossibly sharp. Kael stumbled, his spear slipping from his grasp as he groaned in pain.\n\"What is that?\" Sophia pushed out, her voice strained.\nThrough the clouds of pain, she saw them: dolphins, or what had once been dolphins. Their sleek forms were twisted, their skin marred by jagged black veins. Their eyes glowed with a sickly green light, and their mouths opened to release another deafening flash of corrupted sonar.\n\"Move!\" Kael barked, regaining enough calm to pull Sophia behind a coral outcrop. \"They're using sound to disorient us!\"\nSophia's hands trembled as she fumbled for the crystalline reader she had brought. \"If I can\" She gritted her teeth, focusing through the pain. \"If I can isolate the frequency, I might be able to counter it.\"\nArin's eyes narrowed, her voice tight. \"Do it fast. They're circling back.\"\nSophia activated the device, its soft hum barely noticeable over the cacophony. Her fingers flew over the controls, adjusting dials and recalibrating as the scanner produced a faint pulse of its own. The dolphins' cries wavered for a moment, then returned with even greater force.\n\"It's not enough,\" Sophia muttered, fear creeping into her voice. \"I need more time.\"\nKael's jaw tightened as he stepped forward, his spear glowing with energy. \"You don't have it.\" With a swift move, he hurled the weapon, striking one of the creatures. The corrupted dolphin let out a keening wail before sinking into the shadows, but its friends only grew more frenzied.\n\"Kael, stop!\" Sophia shouted. \"Killing them won't solve this. They're not themselves.\"\n\"Then what do you suggest?\" he snapped, his frustration obvious. \"Because they're about to tear us apart.\"\n\"Sophia's right,\" Arin interrupted, her hands glowing with dark energy. \"This isn't just a physical attack. It's magical rot, and it's feeding off their aggression.\"\nSophia's mind raced, the scanner's data flashing before her eyes. \"Their sonar it's not random. It's a pattern, like a warning. If I can stop it...\"\nArin frowned. \"That's a big 'if.'\"\n\"Do you have a better idea?\" Sophia shot back.\nArin paused, then nodded. \"Fine. Just don't get us killed.\"\nSophia adjusted the reader, syncing it with the pulses she could hear beneath the chaos. Her hybrid senses sharpened, her connection to the water around her getting clearer. She felt the rhythm of the corrupted sonar, its twisted melody grating against the natural currents.\n\"Almost there,\" she murmured, her attention absolute.\nThe corrupted dolphins pushed forward, their cries reaching a crescendo. Kael and Arin moved to intercept, their combined efforts barely keeping the creatures at bay. Sophia's hands flew across the scanner's controls, her own energy resonating with the gadget as she made the final adjustments.\n\"Now!\" she yelled, activating the counterfrequency.\nA deep, resonant hum rippled through the water, clashing with the dolphins' cries. The twisted sound shattered, the green glow in their eyes flickering before dimming completely. One by one, the dolphins stilled, their bodies relaxing as the corruption faded. The sickly veins faded, leaving them dazed but living.\nSophia slumped with relief, her limbs trembling. \"It worked...\"\nKael put a steadying hand on her shoulder, his expression a mix of admiration and concern. \"You did it. But how?\"\nShe shook her head, still catching her breath. \"I I don't know. It's like I could feel the signal, like it was part of me.\"\nArin studied her, a thoughtful frown on her face. \"Your powers are evolving. Faster than I expected.\"\nBefore Sophia could answer, a low rumble echoed through the water. The dolphins bolted, their sleek forms disappearing into the depths. A shadow passed over the group, vast and threatening.\n\"What was that?\" Kael asked, his voice low.\nArin's face paled. \"Something worse than dolphins.\"\nSophia's heart pounded as she glanced at the reader. The numbers spiked, the screen flashing red. Whatever was coming, it wasn't just tainted. It was something else entirely.\n\"We need to move,\" she said, her voice shaking. \"Now.\"\nThe rumble grew louder, the water vibrating with a sinister force. As the shadow grew closer, Sophia felt the Leviathan's presence, a suffocating weight that chilled her to the bone. They swam as fast as they could, but the sense of impending doom remained, following them like a predator stalking its prey.\nBack at the palace, the group relayed their results to Tharros. The dragon king's expression darkened as he listened, his golden eyes blazing with purpose.\n\"The Leviathan's corruption is spreading faster than we anticipated,\" he said. \"We'll need to act quickly if we're to stop it.\"\nSophia nodded, though her mind was still spinning. The encounter had left her shaken, but also more driven than ever. The Leviathan's shade was growing, and they were running out of time.\nArin placed a hand on Sophia's arm, her touch unusually gentle. \"Whatever's happening to you, it's important. You're changing, and it might be the only thing that can save us.\"\nSophia met her look, a flicker of fear and resolve in her eyes. \"Then I'll do whatever it takes. But we need to be ready. The Leviathan won't stop until it's eaten everything.\"\nThe room fell silent, the weight of her words resting over them. Outside, the waters of Aquaria shimmered slightly, a fragile light in the face of encroaching darkness.\nShattered Defenses",

        "content": "The tension in Aquaria's royal council room was palpable. Tharros sat at the head of the table, his golden eyes scanning the room with the intensity of a storm about to break. Around him, the council members murmured in low voices, their anxiety thick in the water. The Leviathan's growing impact was no longer a distant threat-it was here, clawing at their borders.\n\"Order!\" Tharros' voice cut through the din like a blade, demanding instant silence. He rose, towering above the gathered leaders. \"The magical barriers that protect Aquaria are weakening. We must solve this failure before it's too late.\"\nA mutter swept through the room despite his warning. Councilor Dravik, an elder with sharp features and a voice that always seemed to carry an edge of dislike, leaned forward. \"Your Majesty, these failures began after the introduction of surface technology into our defenses. Is it not possible that the surface dweller's impact has done more harm than good?\"\nSophia bristled at the pointed comment but held her tongue. She had faced her share of skepticism since arriving in Aquaria, but the blatant charge still stung.\n\"The Leviathan's corruption is not bound by technology or magic,\" Tharros responded, his tone sharp. \"Blaming Sophia or her methods distracts us from the real threat.\"\nDravik's lips curled into a thin smile. \"Perhaps, but should we not question if her presence has unbalanced our traditions?\"\nBefore Sophia could reply, Kael slammed his fist on the table, the sound reverberating through the chamber. \"Enough! Pointing fingers won't increase the barriers or stop the Leviathan. We need answers, not petty accusations.\"\nThe room fell into an awkward silence. Tharros' gaze stayed on Dravik for a moment longer before he turned to address the council. \"Kael is right. Time is not on our side. Sophia-\" He pointed toward her, his expression softening slightly. \"Explain what we know.\"\nSophia stood, her pulse quickening as all eyes turned to her. \"The Leviathan's corruption isn't random. It's targeting weak places in our magical barriers, areas where the energy flow has already been disrupted.\" She tapped the glowing map projected above the table, highlighting several places. \"These zones are critical. If we don't strengthen them soon, the entire network could collapse.\"\nCouncilor Arith, a middleaged merwoman known for her realism, leaned forward. \"And how do you propose we do that? Our means are stretched thin as it is.\"\n\"We combine surface technology with Aquarian magic,\" Sophia said firmly. \"It's risky, but it's our best shot.\"\nA ripple of dissatisfaction spread through the council. Dravik's voice rose above the others. \"You see? She seeks to merge their ways into ours. This is how the Leviathan gains its foothold-through discord and the loss of tradition.\"\n\"Discord is exactly what feeds it,\" Sophia shot back, her voice calm despite the anger bubbling beneath the surface. \"The Leviathan thrives on division. If we can't stand together, we've already lost.\"\nTharros raised a hand, silencing the room once more. \"Enough. Sophia's idea will be explored. We'll send teams to reinforce the weakest barriers instantly. Dravik, if you have a better answer, I'm listening.\"\nDravik's mouth opened, then closed. He glared at Sophia but said nothing. Tharros' eyes lingered on him, a silent warning not to push further.\nThe meeting ended with a sense of urgency hanging in the air. As the council members filed out, Tharros motioned for Sophia, Kael, and Arin to stay behind.\n\"That could have gone worse,\" Kael mumbled, his arms crossed.\n\"It's not over yet,\" Arin said, her voice low. \"Dravik won't back down so easily.\"\nTharros turned to Sophia, his face unreadable. \"You handled yourself well. But you've made enemies today.\"\n\"I'm not here to win a popularity contest,\" Sophia replied. \"I'm here to stop the Leviathan.\"\nA flicker of a smile crossed Tharros' lips, but it was gone as quickly as it appeared. \"Good. Because things are about to get much harder.\"\nHours later, Sophia, Kael, and Arin set out to inspect one of the failing barrier points. The location was a nexus of magical energy, marked by ancient runes carved into the ocean floor. As they approached, the water grew colder, the oncevibrant coral surrounding the area now dull and lifeless.\n\"This doesn't feel right,\" Kael said, his spear at the ready. \"Stay alert.\"\nSophia activated her scanner, the device emitting a faint hum as it analyzed the barrier's energy. The readings were erratic, the energy flow sputtering like a failing heartbeat.\n\"The corruption's already here,\" Sophia said, her voice tight. \"We need to stabilize it before it spreads further.\"\nArin knelt beside one of the runes, her fingers tracing the ancient symbols. \"These wards are centuries old. They weren't meant to withstand something like this.\"\n\"Can you reinforce them?\" Sophia asked.\nArin hesitated, her usually confident demeanor faltering. \"Maybe. But it'll take time.\"\n\"We might not have that,\" Kael said, his gaze fixed on the shadows lurking at the edge of the barrier. \"Something's coming.\"\nSophia followed his line of sight, her stomach twisting at the sight of twisted shapes moving just beyond the light. The Leviathan's creatures-warped and unnatural-were watching them.\n\"We're not alone,\" she whispered.\nThe creatures struck without warning, a swarm of corrupted eels surging toward them with terrifying speed. Kael moved to intercept, his spear slicing through the water with precision. Arin unleashed a blast of magic, the energy crackling as it struck the eels, but more kept coming.\n\"Sophia, hurry!\" Kael shouted, fending off the attackers.\nSophia's hands trembled as she worked to sync the scanner with the barrier's energy. The device beeped in protest, the readings unstable. \"Come on,\" she muttered, her frustration mounting.\nAn eel broke through the defensive line, its jagged teeth snapping inches from Sophia's arm. She recoiled, her heart pounding as Kael speared it midlunge.\n\"Focus!\" he barked, his voice sharp but not unkind.\nGritting her teeth, Sophia adjusted the scanner, aligning its output with the barrier's frequency. The device emitted a low hum, the energy stabilizing slightly. \"I think I've got it,\" she said, her voice tinged with both relief and urgency.\n\"Then finish it,\" Arin said, her magic flaring as she held back another wave of eels.\nWith a final adjustment, Sophia activated the scanner's stabilizing function. A surge of energy rippled through the barrier, the failing runes glowing brightly as the corruption receded. The eels faltered, their movements sluggish before they retreated into the darkness.\nThe group stood in silence, the only sound their labored breathing.\n\"It's holding,\" Sophia said, her voice barely above a whisper.\nKael lowered his spear, his shoulders relaxing slightly. \"For now.\"\nArin straightened, her expression grim. \"But this is just one point. How many more are on the brink of collapse?\"\nSophia glanced at the scanner, the map glowing faintly with markers of other failing barriers. \"Too many.\"\nBefore anyone could respond, a distant roar echoed through the water. It was low and guttural, a sound that sent chills down Sophia's spine.\n\"The Leviathan,\" Kael said, his voice a mix of dread and determination.\nSophia's heart sank as the sound faded, leaving an ominous silence in its wake. \"It knows we're trying to stop it.\"\nTharros' words from earlier echoed in her mind. Things are about to get much harder.\nBack at the palace, the council reconvened to hear their report. The atmosphere was tense, the earlier disagreements now overshadowed by the looming threat.\n\"The barriers can be stabilized,\" Sophia said, addressing the room. \"But we're running out of time. We need every resource, every friend we can muster.\"\nDravik scoffed. \"And what happens when your methods fail? Do we simply submit to the surface as well?\"\n\"Enough,\" Tharros said, his voice cutting through the room like thunder. \"Sophia's efforts have bought us time. If you have nothing useful to add, then step aside.\"\nDravik fell silent, his face dark. Tharros turned to the rest of the council. \"Prepare our forces. Strengthen the final barriers. The Leviathan is coming, and we will be ready.\"\nAs the council dispersed, Tharros neared Sophia. \"You've done well, but the hardest battles are still ahead. Are you ready?\"\nSophia met his eyes, her resolve unshaken. \"I have to be.\"\nFar below the castle, in the darkest depths of the ocean, the Leviathan stirred. Its glowing eyes opened, its presence a cold, crushing weight. The barriers may have held for now, but it was only a matter of time before they broke. And when they did, Aquaria would fall.\nThe Leviathan's roar echoed through the abyss, a frightening promise of the destruction to come.\nProphecy of the Abyss\nThe silence in the council room was suffocating. Tharros' words still hung in the air, an order that left no room for argument. Sophia glanced at him, his jaw tight with purpose. The Leviathan's roar had shaken everyone, a grim warning that their enemy was watching.\n\"We leave for the Whale Song Seers at dawn,\" Tharros stated, his tone brooking no dissent. \"They may hold answers we can't afford to ignore.\"\nSophia's pulse quickened. The seers were a legend even in Aquaria, their cryptic signs often steering the kingdom's fate. But their puzzles came with a price, and she couldn't shake the feeling that the cost would be hers to bear.\nThe trip to the coral labyrinth was treacherous. The waters grew colder as they dropped, the light from Aquaria's spires fading into a dim, eerie glow. The labyrinth loomed ahead, a twisted maze of coral walls that pulsed with faint bioluminescence. It was beautiful, yet foreboding, as if the building itself was alive.\nKael swam ahead, his spear ready. \"Stay close. These waters aren't safe.\"\nSophia nodded, her gaze darting to the shadows that flickered at the edges of her vision. \"What exactly are we looking for?\" she asked, her voice low.\nArin's face was unreadable. \"The seers will find us.\"\nTharros kept to the back, his presence a steadying force. Yet Sophia could feel his unease, the stress radiating from him like a current. He wasn't just worried about the seers. He was worried about her.\n\"We're close,\" Arin said suddenly, her eyes narrowing. The water ahead shimmered, a faint melody threading through the quiet. It was eerie and beautiful, a song that seemed to pull at Sophia's very soul.\nThe group stopped as the seers appeared. Massive, majestic whales slid into view, their forms glowing with ethereal light. Their voices blended in a symphony of sound, the music resonating through the water and into Sophia's bones.\n\"Welcome,\" one of the whales said, its voice a deep rumble that Sophia felt more than heard. \"You seek the wisdom of the abyss.\"\nTharros stepped forward, bowing his head. \"We do. The Leviathan's shadow grows, and our defenses weaken. We need guidance.\"\nThe seer's gaze shifted to Sophia, its glowing eyes piercing. \"The abyss will yield its secrets when the surface meets the deep,\" it intoned, the words reverberating like a chant.\nSophia's breath caught. \"What does that mean?\"\nThe whale's song deepened, the melody taking on an edge of sadness. \"The answer lies within you, child of two worlds. But beware, for the cost may be bigger than you can bear.\"\nTharros stiffened, his hands clenching. \"No. There must be another way.\"\n\"The path is not ours to shape,\" the seer responded. \"The abyss calls to her, and her choice will determine the fate of all.\"\nAs the seers vanished into the depths, their song lingering like an echo, the group stayed in stunned silence. Sophia's mind raced, the weight of their words pressing down on her.\n\"They're wrong,\" Tharros said suddenly, his voice firm. \"You're not a sacrifice.\"\nSophia turned to him, her eyes searching his face. \"What if they're right? What if I\" She couldn't finish the sentence, the thought too frightening to voice.\n\"We'll find another way,\" he insisted, his tone leaving no room for question. \"I won't let anything happen to you.\"\nKael's voice broke through the stillness. \"We should get back. The seers' words won't mean anything if we're attacked out here.\"\nArin nodded, though her face was grim. \"He's right. Let's move.\"\nThe trip back to Aquaria was silent, the weight of the prophecy hanging over them like a shadow. Sophia couldn't shake the seer's words, their melody repeating in her mind. She was the key, but what did that truly mean? And what would it cost her?\nAs they neared the city, the water grew warmer, the familiar glow of Aquaria's spires a welcome sight. But the unease remained, the sense that something was waiting, watching.\nTharros led Sophia to her quarters, his presence a steadying force. Yet she could see the fear etched in his features, the tension in his movements.\n\"Rest,\" he said softly, his hand brushing hers. \"We'll face this together.\"\nSophia nodded, though her heart was heavy. \"Goodnight, Tharros.\"\nHe paused, as if he wanted to say more, but finally turned and left. Sophia watched him go, the silence of her rooms amplifying the turmoil in her mind.\nLater that night, Sophia awoke with a start. The air felt different, charged with a strange energy. She sat up, her senses on high alert.\nA soft hum filled the room, a vibration that echoed in her chest. She followed it, her heart pounding as she stepped onto the balcony. The city below was quiet, the seas calm. But in the distance, a faint glow pulsed in the darkness, drawing her gaze.\n\"What is that?\" she whispered, her voice barely audible.\nThe hum grew louder, the glow intensifying. Sophia felt a pull, an irresistible force pushing her toward the unknown. She gripped the railing, her breath quickening as the Leviathan's shadow loomed bigger in her mind.\n\"The abyss will yield its secrets,\" she murmured, the seers' words echoing in her thoughts.\nA sudden chill ran down her spine. The glow flickered, then disappeared, leaving only darkness in its wake. Sophia's heart pounded as she looked into the void, the weight of the prophecy settling over her like a shroud.\nWhatever lay ahead, she knew one thing for certain-there was no going back.\nThe next morning, Sophia found herself at the palace's war room, standing before a glowing map of Aquaria's lands. Tharros, Kael, and Arin joined her, their faces grim.\n\"The seers' words suggest a connection between the surface and the abyss,\" Sophia began, tracing the map with her fingers. \"We need to figure out what that means before it's too late.\"\nKael frowned, crossing his arms. \"The surface hasn't interfered in centuries. Why would this connection matter now?\"\nArin's gaze was distant, her words quiet. \"Because Sophia's existence changes everything. She's not just a bridge-she's the key.\"",

I won't let fear stop us.\"\nTharros put a hand on her shoulder, his touch grounding. \"You won't face this alone.\"\nBefore Sophia could reply, an alarm echoed through the palace. Guards rushed into the room, their faces panicked.\n\"Your Majesty, the Leviathan's forces are moving. They've broken one of the outer barriers.\"\nThe room erupted into chaos, but Tharros' words cut through like a blade. \"Prepare the defenses. We move now.\"\nAs the group hurried to the city's outskirts, Sophia couldn't shake the feeling that the Leviathan's moves were deliberate, as if it knew their plans. The seers' forecast echoed in her mind, each word a puzzle piece she couldn't yet fit together.\nWhen they arrived at the breached barrier, the sight that greeted them was worse than Sophia had thought. The onceglowing runes were dark, the energy that protected the city now a faint flicker. Twisted creatures rushed through the opening, their corrupted forms a mockery of Aquaria's natural beauty.\n\"Hold the line!\" Kael shouted, diving into the fight. His spear flashed as he struck, each action precise and deadly.\nArin stood beside Sophia, her hands sparkling with dark magic. \"Stay close,\" she warned, her voice steady despite the chaos.\nSophia triggered her scanner, the device whirring as it analyzed the barrier's remnants. \"It's not completely gone,\" she said, her voice tight. \"If I can amplify the energy\"\n\"Then do it,\" Tharros said, his dragon form glowing as he prepared to attack. \"We'll buy you time.\"\nThe battle raged around her as Sophia worked, her fingers flying over the scanner's settings. The Leviathan's forces pressed closer, but Kael and Arin held their ground, their united strength a formidable defense.\n\"Almost there,\" Sophia whispered, her heart racing.\nA sudden roar split the air, and the Leviathan's shadow loomed over the battlefield. Sophia froze, the scanner slipping from her hands as the creature's presence washed over her. It was overwhelming, a force of pure evil that seemed to drain the very light from the water.\n\"Sophia, focus!\" Tharros shouted, his voice snapping her out of her dream.\nShe grabbed the scanner, her purpose hardening. With a final adjustment, she triggered the device, a surge of energy rippling through the barrier. The runes flared to life, the gap closing as the Leviathan's creatures were forced back.\nThe group stood in quiet as the battlefield cleared, the Leviathan retreating into the depths. But its roar remained, a chilling promise of what was to come.\n\"This isn't over,\" Sophia said, her voice trembling but determined.\nTharros put a hand on her back, his expression grave. \"No. It's just beginning.\"\nDiscord Among Allies\nThe palace's air was thick with anxiety. The Leviathan's departure had bought them time, but no one believed it would last. As Sophia paced the war room, she couldn't shake the thought that the seers' prophecy had set something in motion, something far beyond their control.\n\"You need rest,\" Kael's voice broke through her thinking. He stood near the doorway, arms crossed but his expression softer than normal. \"You've been running yourself into the ground.\"\nSophia shook her head. \"Rest won't stop the Leviathan. I need to figure out what the promise means.\"\nKael sighed, stepping closer. \"You're carrying too much of this on your own. We're a team.\"\nBefore Sophia could answer, Arin entered the room, her presence like a cold wind cutting through the warmth Kael had brought. Her face was guarded, her dark eyes flicking between them.\n\"We have a problem,\" Arin said, her voice sharp.\nKael straightened, his face hardening. \"What kind of problem?\"\n\"My past,\" Arin answered, her tone laced with bitterness. \"My former coven has decided now is the perfect time to question my loyalty.\"\nSophia frowned. \"Why? What do they want?\"\nArin's jaw stiffened. \"To remind everyone that I was once an outcast. They're using this situation to sow doubt about me and, by extension, all of us.\"\nKael's grip on his spear tightened. \"Typical. They'd rather tear us apart than face the real enemy.\"\nSophia's heart sank. The Leviathan lived on discord, and this internal strife was exactly what it needed. \"We can't let them divide us,\" she said strongly. \"We have to address this headon.\"\nArin's eyes softened slightly as she looked at Sophia. \"You don't know what you're walking into. They won't listen to reason.\"\n\"They'll listen to me,\" Tharros' deep voice echoed as he entered the room. His golden eyes blazed with determination. \"No one undermines my council while I'm king.\"\nThe meeting with Arin's old coven was held in the Hall of Tides, a grand chamber filled with flowing streams of enchanted water. The coven's leader, Lysara, stood at the middle, her regal posture a stark contrast to the venom in her words.\n\"Arin has always walked a fine line between loyalty and betrayal,\" Lysara said, her voice carrying through the hall. \"How can we trust her to defend Aquaria when her own past is riddled with deceit?\"\nArin's hands clenched at her sides, but she didn't rise to the trap. Sophia, however, couldn't stay silent.\n\"Arin has proven her loyalty time and time again,\" Sophia said, stepping forward. Her voice was steady, but her heart pounded in her chest. \"She's risked her life to protect this city and everyone in it. Can any of you say the same?\"\nLysara's eyes narrowed. \"And who are you to speak of loyalty? A surface person who's barely been here long enough to understand our ways?\"\nTharros' presence loomed behind Sophia, his voice cutting through the building tension. \"Sophia speaks with my authority. If you question her, you question me.\"\nThe room fell quiet, the weight of Tharros' words pressing down on everyone present. Lysara's composure wavered, but she quickly recovered.\n\"Even so, we cannot ignore the risks. The Leviathan's corruption spreads, and question weakens us. Can you promise that Arin's magic won't turn against us?\"\nArin stepped forward, her words cold but steady. \"My magic is the only reason some of you are still alive. If that's not enough for you, then perhaps you should ask yourselves who the real threat is.\"\nThe tension in the room was evident. Sophia could feel the undercurrents of fear and doubt, but she also saw something else: the faintest flicker of understanding. She seized the moment.\n\"The Leviathan feeds on division,\" Sophia said, her voice rising with determination. \"If we keep fighting each other, we're doing its work for it. We have to stand together, or we'll fall apart.\"\nFor a moment, the hall was silent. Then, slowly, some of the group members nodded. Lysara looked unconvinced but said nothing more.\nAfter the meeting, the group met in Tharros' private chambers. The mood was tense but quieter, the worst of the storm seemingly passed.\n\"You handled that well,\" Tharros said, his eyes fixed on Sophia. \"But this isn't over. Lysara won't back down easily.\"\nSophia nodded, her mind still rushing. \"We have to keep the focus on the Leviathan. If we let these divides fester, we're doomed.\"",

        "content": "Arin was quiet, her normal sharpness replaced with something softer. \"Thank you. For standing up for me.\"\nSophia smiled. \"You'd do the same for me.\"\nKael cleared his throat, drawing their attention. \"We should prepare for what's next. The Leviathan won't wait for us to figure out our differences.\"\nTharros nodded, his face grim. \"Agreed. We need to reinforce the barriers and boost our defenses. No more distractions.\"\nAs the group dispersed, Sophia stayed, her thoughts heavy. The prophecy still hung over her, its meaning elusive but its weight undeniable. And then there was the rising tension between her and Tharros-and the way Kael's presence seemed to complicate everything.\nShe sighed, stepping out onto the balcony. The city below shimmered with light, a fragile beauty against the approaching darkness. She felt Kael approach before he spoke, his presence as steady as ever.\n\"You did good today,\" he said, his voice quiet but serious.\nSophia glanced at him, her heart twisting. \"I don't know if it's enough. There's so much at stake, and I\" She trailed off, unable to find the words.\nKael's gaze relaxed. \"You're stronger than you think. We'll get through this. Together.\"\nHis words were comforting, but they also stirred something deeper, something that left her feeling more confused than ever. She looked away, the weight of her feelings threatening to overwhelm her.\n\"Thank you, Kael,\" she said softly.\nBefore he could reply, a distant rumble shook the city. Sophia's breath caught as she turned toward the horizon. The waters far beyond Aquaria's borders glowed with an ominous light, the Leviathan's presence obvious.\nKael's face darkened. \"It's starting.\"\nSophia's heart raced as the glow intensified, a chilling warning that their time was running out. Whatever divisions remained, whatever doubts lingered, they had to conquer them. The fate of their world depended on it.\nLeviathan’s Reach\nThe first quake hit just before dawn. Sophia bolted upright in her quarters, the faint glow of Aquaria's towers reflecting off the walls. The air felt heavy, charged with something dark and evil.\nA second quake followed, stronger than the first. Sophia threw on her gear and rushed toward the palace's command center, her heart racing. The halls were a flurry of movement as soldiers and mages hurried to their posts.\nKael's words cut through the chaos as she entered the room. \"Report!\" he barked, his power clear.\nA scout stepped forward, his face pale. \"The Leviathan's creatures have breached the outer barriers. They're hitting the outskirts.\"\nTharros turned to Kael, his golden eyes burning. \"Take a team and hold the line. Buy us time to strengthen the defenses.\"\nKael nodded sharply. \"Understood.\" His eyes shifted to Sophia. \"Stay here. The house needs you.\"\nSophia bristled. \"I can help. You'll need someone who understands the barriers.\"\nKael paused, his jaw tightening. Before he could argue, Tharros stepped in. \"She's right. If the barriers fall totally, it won't matter how many warriors we have.\"\nKael's expression softened, but his tone stayed firm. \"Stay close to me, then. Let's move.\"\nThe edges of Aquaria were in chaos. Twisted creatures-once beautiful sea life now corrupted by the Leviathan's influence-swarmed the streets. Their glowing green eyes and jagged bodies were a nightmarish sight.\nKael's team spread out, their weapons gleaming with magical light. \"Hold the line!\" Kael ordered, his voice steady despite the chaos. \"Push them back!\"\nSophia stayed behind the front lines, her reader in hand. The barrier's energy was weak, its flow sputtering like a failed heartbeat. She fixed the device, her hands trembling. \"The barrier's barely holding. If we don't stabilize it now, it'll fall completely.\"\nKael drove his spear through a monster, its body dissolving into a black mist. \"Do what you need to do. We'll cover you.\"\nSophia nodded, focused on the scanner. She synced its output with the barrier's frequency, her mixed senses sharpening as she felt the energy flow around her. It was like tuning a broken instrument, each change bringing the barrier closer to stability.\nA sudden roar shook the water, and a massive creature appeared from the shadows. It was bigger than the others, its form rippling with dark energy. The warriors faltered, their faith wavering.\n\"Focus!\" Kael shouted, charging toward the beast. His spear crackled with energy as he jumped, striking the creature's armored hide. The hit sent a shockwave through the water, but the beast barely flinched.\n\"Kael!\" Sophia screamed, her heart lurching as the thing lashed out with a massive tail. Kael twisted midair, barely avoiding the blow.\n\"I'm fine,\" he called back, his voice strained. \"Just hurry up!\"\nSophia gritted her teeth, her fingers flying over the scanner's settings. The barrier's energy surged, its glow increasing. But it wasn't enough. She needed more power.\n\"What are you doing?\" Arin's words cut through the chaos. The sea witch appeared beside Sophia, her hands glowing with dark magic.\n\"The barrier needs a boost,\" Sophia said, her voice tight. \"Can you channel energy into it?\"\nArin's eyes narrowed. \"It's risky. If the balance changes too much, it could destabilize completely.\"\n\"We don't have a choice,\" Sophia answered. \"Do it.\"\nArin paused for a heartbeat, then nodded. She extended her hands, dark strands of energy flowing into the scanner. The device hummed with fresh power, the barrier's glow brightening.\nThe massive creature roared again, its attention shifting to Sophia and Arin. It surged forward, its corrupted form radiating hatred.\nKael intercepted, his spear slicing through the water. \"Not today,\" he growled, driving the weapon into the creature's side. It let out a primal cry, thrashing wildly.\nSophia and Arin worked in unison, their energies merging as they stabilized the barrier. Sweat beaded on Sophia's face, her entire body trembling from the effort. \"Just a little more\"\nA sudden jolt of energy shot through the scanner, and the barrier flared to life. The corrupted creatures recoiled, their forms dissolving as the protective energy swept through the area.\nThe massive beast let out one final roar before falling, its body dissolving into nothingness. The water grew still, the silence almost deafening.\nThe fallout was a blur. The warriors regrouped, their faces a mix of satisfaction and exhaustion. Kael approached Sophia, his armor battered but his resolve unshaken.\n\"You did it,\" he said, his voice filled with respect.\nSophia shook her head. \"We did it. I couldn't have done it without you.\"\nArin smirked, her normal sarcasm returning. \"Don't get too sentimental. We've still got a lot of work to do.\"\nKael chuckled, but his face turned serious as he looked at Sophia. \"You're more important to this fight than you realize. Don't ever doubt that.\"\nSophia's heart swelled at his words, but before she could react, Tharros arrived. His presence was as dominating as ever, his golden eyes scanning the scene.\n\"The barrier held,\" he said, his voice calm but determined. \"Good work. All of you.\"\nSophia met his eyes, her resolve firm. \"We're not done yet. The Leviathan's not going to stop.\"\nTharros nodded, a flicker of pride in his eyes. \"No, it won't. But neither will we.\"\nLater that night, Sophia stood on the palace balcony, looking out at the dark expanse of the ocean. The fight had been won, but the Leviathan's presence still lingered, a shadow over their victory.\nKael joined her, his face thoughtful. \"You're thinking about the prophecy, aren't you?\"\nSophia nodded. \"The seers said I'm the key. But what if that means I\" She trailed off, unable to finish the thought.\nKael put a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"Whatever it means, you won't face it alone. We'll figure it out together.\"\nHis words brought her some relief, but the unease remained. The Leviathan was out there, and its reach was growing. As the ocean's currents whispered around her, Sophia knew the fights ahead would only grow more dangerous.\nAnd the cost might be bigger than any of them were prepared to pay.\nThe Abyss Calls\nThe ocean's currents whispered through the palace, their rhythm soothing yet unnervingly hollow. Sophia leaned against the balcony rail, her mind churning. The events of the day still weighed heavily on her. The barrier had held, but the Leviathan's presence was unyielding. Every victory felt like a fleeting reprieve, a breath before the next wave of destruction.\nShe turned her gaze to the horizon, where the ocean's darkness met the faint shimmer of Aquaria's lights. The Leviathan's shadow was there, lurking, waiting. And she could feel it. It wasn't just a distant threat anymore; it was an ache in her chest, a pull she couldn't explain.\nExhaustion dragged at her. She retreated to her quarters, hoping sleep might offer some clarity, though a part of her feared what she might find in her dreams.\nThe abyss was endless. Cold and unyielding, it stretched in every direction, an expanse of blackness that swallowed sound and light. Sophia floated in the void, her breath shallow, her heart pounding.\nA voice echoed through the darkness, low and resonant. \"Sophia.\"\nShe spun, searching for the source, but there was nothing. The voice came again, closer this time, wrapping around her like a current.\n\"You cannot hide.\"\nHer pulse quickened as the darkness shifted, rippling like disturbed water. Shapes emerged, monstrous and grotesque, their glowing green eyes piercing the void. The Leviathan's creatures surrounded her, their twisted forms pulsating with corruption.\nSophia tried to move, but her limbs felt heavy, the water thick and oppressive. The creatures closed in, their eyes unblinking, their presence suffocating.\nAnd then, it appeared.\nThe Leviathan rose from the depths, its massive form blotting out what little light remained. Its eyes burned with an unnatural intensity, its voice resonating through her very being.\n\"You are mine.\"\nThe words sent a jolt of terror through her, but there was something else-a strange familiarity, a connection she couldn't deny. The Leviathan's gaze bore into her, and for a fleeting moment, she felt as if it could see every part of her, every secret, every fear.\n\"Why me?\" she whispered, her voice trembling.\nThe Leviathan's laughter rumbled through the abyss, deep and chilling. \"You are the bridge. The key. The abyss calls to you because you belong to it.\"\nSophia's chest tightened. She shook her head, willing herself to wake up, to escape the void. But the Leviathan's presence was unrelenting.\n\"You cannot run from what you are,\" it said, its voice a haunting melody. \"Soon, you will understand.\"\nThe abyss began to collapse, the darkness folding in on itself. The Leviathan's eyes were the last thing she saw before everything went black.\nSophia awoke with a gasp, her body drenched in sweat. Her room was still, the faint glow of bioluminescent coral casting soft patterns on the walls. She sat up, her breaths coming in shallow gulps as she tried to shake the remnants of the dream.\nBut it wasn't just a dream. She could still feel the Leviathan's presence, its voice echoing in her mind. The connection was real, and it terrified her.\nA knock at the door startled her. She hesitated before calling out, \"Come in.\"\nArin entered, her expression guarded. \"You look like you've seen a ghost.\"\nSophia managed a weak smile. \"Something like that.\"\nArin closed the door behind her, her movements uncharacteristically hesitant. \"I felt something,\" she admitted, her voice low. \"In the water. A disturbance. It woke me up.\"\nSophia's stomach twisted. \"I had a dream,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"The abyss. The Leviathan. It spoke to me.\"\nArin's eyes darkened, a flicker of fear crossing her face. \"What did it say?\"\n\"It called me the bridge. The key.\" Sophia's hands trembled as she recounted the dream. \"It said I belong to the abyss.\"\nArin was silent for a moment, her gaze distant. Then she spoke, her voice tinged with reluctance. \"I've had dreams like that.\"\nSophia's eyes widened. \"What?\"\nArin nodded, her expression grim. \"Not often, but enough to know they're not just dreams. The Leviathan it's trying to reach us. To pull us closer.\"\nSophia's mind raced. \"Why didn't you tell me?\"\n\"Because it's not something I like to talk about,\" Arin snapped, her usual sharpness returning. She took a deep breath, composing herself. \"But if it's reaching out to you too, then we can't ignore it.\"\nSophia nodded, her fear giving way to determination. \"We need to figure out what it wants. And why it's connected to me.\"\nArin's gaze softened. \"Be careful, Sophia. The Leviathan doesn't just want to connect. It wants to consume.\"\nThe next morning, the group gathered in the war room. Sophia recounted her dream, her voice steady despite the unease gnawing at her. Tharros listened intently, his golden eyes narrowing as she spoke.\n\"It's trying to manipulate you,\" he said, his tone firm. \"To make you doubt yourself.\"\n\"Or it's warning me,\" Sophia countered. \"Either way, we need to understand the connection.\"\nKael frowned, his expression dark. \"Why would the Leviathan single you out? What makes you different?\"\nSophia hesitated, the weight of the prophecy pressing down on her. \"Because I'm the bridge. Between the surface and the deep. Between magic and science. Maybe even between the Leviathan and whatever's left of its humanity.\"\nThe room fell silent, the gravity of her words sinking in.\n\"If that's true,\" Arin said quietly, \"then the Leviathan won't stop until it has you.\"\nSophia met her gaze, a flicker of fear in her eyes. \"Then we need to make sure it doesn't.\"\nThat night, Sophia found herself drawn to the balcony once more. The ocean stretched out before her, vast and unknowable. The Leviathan's voice still lingered in her mind, its words a haunting refrain.\n\"You are mine.\"\nShe gripped the railing, her resolve hardening. Whatever the Leviathan wanted, whatever the prophecy meant, she wouldn't let it define her. She would fight, not just for herself but for everyone who depended on her.\nAs she stared into the darkness, a faint glow appeared on the horizon. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, but it sent a chill down her spine.\nThe abyss was calling.\nBuilding a Coalition\nThe glow on the horizon from the previous night still haunted Sophia as she stood in the palace's main hall, facing a map of Aquaria's territories. Small markers indicated where different clans resided-secluded groups that had once thrived independently but now faced extinction if the Leviathan's reach continued to spread.\nTharros approached, his expression unreadable. \"You're certain about this?\"\nSophia turned to him, her determination unwavering. \"If we're going to stand a chance, we need everyone. Every clan, every warrior. We can't do this alone.\"\n\"They won't trust you,\" Tharros said, his tone soft but firm. \"Many of them barely trust me. You're asking them to follow a surface dweller.\"\nSophia met his gaze. \"I'm not asking for blind trust. I'm offering knowledge, strategy, and a way to survive. They'll listen, even if they don't like me.\"\nTharros' lips pressed into a thin line. \"I'll send Kael and Arin with you. You'll need their support.\"\nSophia nodded, grateful for the reinforcement. \"Thank you.\"\nThe first stop on their mission was the Coral Fang Clan, a proud and isolated group known for their fierce warriors. Their village lay within a maze of jagged coral spires, each one adorned with glowing markings that warned outsiders to tread carefully.\nKael led the way, his spear at the ready. \"Don't expect a warm welcome,\" he said over his shoulder. \"They're not fond of outsiders.\"\n\"I'm not here to be liked,\" Sophia replied, keeping her voice steady. \"I just need them to listen.\"\nWhen they reached the village's center, they were greeted by a circle of armed guards. Their leader, a towering merwoman named Seraya, stepped forward, her gaze cold and calculating.\n\"Why have you come?\" Seraya demanded, her voice echoing through the coral structures.\nSophia stepped forward, ignoring the hostility in the leader's tone. \"I'm here because the Leviathan's corruption is spreading, and it's only a matter of time before it reaches your home. We need to unite if we're going to stop it.\"\nSeraya's eyes narrowed. \"And why should we believe a surface dweller knows anything about our world, let alone how to save it?\"",

        "content": "Sophia held her ground. \"Because I've seen it. I've studied the Leviathan's patterns, its movements. I know how it spreads, and I know what it feeds on.\"\nThe warriors murmured among themselves, their skepticism palpable. Seraya crossed her arms, unimpressed. \"Words mean nothing without proof.\"\nSophia pulled out her scanner, activating the holographic map she had compiled. It projected the Leviathan's influence, showing how it spread like a cancer through the waters. The Coral Fang warriors fell silent as the map displayed their territory, marked with faint traces of corruption creeping closer.\n\"This is what you're up against,\" Sophia said, her voice steady. \"If we don't work together, none of us will survive.\"\nSeraya's expression remained unreadable, but there was a flicker of unease in her eyes. She turned to Kael. \"And you? Do you stand by her?\"\nKael nodded without hesitation. \"She speaks the truth. I've fought these creatures. They won't stop until there's nothing left.\"\nAfter a tense moment, Seraya inclined her head. \"We will consider your proposal. But know this: if you betray us, we will show no mercy.\"\nSophia exhaled, relief washing over her. \"Thank you. That's all I ask.\"\nThe next stop was the Lumina Clan, a group renowned for their magical abilities. Their village shimmered with bioluminescent plants, casting an ethereal glow that made the water feel alive.\nArin took the lead this time, her connection to magic earning her wary respect from the clan's leaders. They listened as Sophia explained the Leviathan's patterns, their skepticism slowly giving way to curiosity.\n\"You're saying its movements are predictable?\" one of the elders asked, his voice tinged with doubt.\nSophia nodded. \"It's not random. It's targeting areas of high magical concentration. Places like this.\"\nThe elder's eyes widened. \"You think we're a target?\"\n\"I don't think. I know,\" Sophia said. \"If we don't act now, your village could be next.\"\nArin stepped forward, her voice calm but firm. \"I know some of you doubt her, but I've seen what she can do. Her knowledge could be the key to stopping the Leviathan.\"\nThe clan's leader, a stoic mermaid named Calarys, studied Sophia intently. \"If what you say is true, then we cannot afford to ignore it. We will join your cause.\"\nBy the time they returned to Aquaria, Sophia was drained but hopeful. The alliances weren't perfect, but they were a start. She stood in the war room with Tharros, Kael, and Arin, reviewing the progress they'd made.\n\"You did well,\" Tharros said, his voice low but sincere. \"Not many could have convinced those clans to join us.\"\nSophia looked at him, her exhaustion evident. \"It's not enough. We need more.\"\nTharros stepped closer, his golden eyes searching hers. \"We'll get more. But you need to rest. You can't save everyone if you collapse first.\"\nSophia opened her mouth to argue but stopped when she saw the concern in his eyes. \"Alright,\" she said softly. \"Just for a little while.\"\nLater that night, Sophia found herself back on the balcony, the cool water brushing against her skin. She stared at the horizon, the weight of the prophecy pressing down on her.\nTharros joined her, his presence as steadying as ever. \"You're carrying too much,\" he said quietly.\n\"Someone has to,\" she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.\nTharros hesitated, then placed a hand on her shoulder. \"You're not alone, Sophia. Remember that.\"\nShe turned to him, a flicker of gratitude in her eyes. \"Thank you, Tharros.\"\nBefore he could respond, a faint vibration rippled through the water. They both turned toward the horizon, where a distant glow pulsed in the darkness.\n\"The Leviathan,\" Tharros said, his voice grim.\nSophia's chest tightened as the glow grew brighter, its presence an ominous reminder of the battles yet to come. The alliances they had built were fragile, and the Leviathan's reach was far from over.\n\"It's starting again,\" she whispered.\nTharros nodded, his expression hardening. \"Then we'll be ready.\"\nThe Corrupted Trenches\nThe faint glow on the horizon remained as a chilling reminder of the Leviathan's reach. Sophia's mind raced as she prepared for the next step. The council's reports were clear: a trench on the outskirts of Aquaria's borders had become a focal point of corruption, and its presence was growing.\nTharros stood beside her in the war room, his golden eyes studying the map. Kael and Arin joined them, their faces grim.\n\"The trench is deeper than any we've explored before,\" Tharros said, his tone steady. \"If the Leviathan has made it a stronghold, it won't be easy to breach.\"\nKael crossed his arms, his jaw tight. \"Easy doesn't matter. We need to stop whatever's happening there before it spreads.\"\nSophia's gaze moved to Tharros. \"How close can we get before the corruption affects us?\"\nTharros paused, a rare flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. \"I can shield us for a time. But the closer we get, the more dangerous it will become.\"\nArin's voice was calm, but her words held weight. \"Then we'll need to move quickly. Whatever's going down there, it's not waiting for us.\"\nThe water grew colder as they descended, the bright colors of Aquaria fading into a murky, oppressive darkness. The trench loomed ahead, its jagged walls glowing with an eerie green light. Sophia felt the weight of the depths pressing down on her, each stroke of her fins harder than the last.\nKael swam at the front, his spear glowing softly with enchanted energy. \"Stay alert. This place doesn't feel right.\"\nSophia nodded, her scanner humming softly as it analyzed the surroundings. The readings were chaotic, the energy signatures changing wildly. \"The corruption is stronger here. It's warping everything.\"\nTharros' form shimmered with faint golden light as he channeled his power to protect them. But even he seemed strained, his moves slower than usual.\n\"Are you alright?\" Sophia asked, her concern obvious.\nTharros gave a curt nod. \"The corruption is draining. But I can manage.\"\nArin's sharp eyes searched the trench walls. \"We're not alone.\"\nThe group froze as a low hiss echoed through the water. From the shadows came serpents, their oncemajestic forms twisted and corrupted. Their scales were cracked, glowing lines of green running along their bodies. Their eyes burned with an evil light.\nKael didn't pause. \"Get ready!\" he barked, surging forward to meet the first serpent. His spear hit true, piercing its side, but the creature twisted violently, forcing him back.\n\"They're stronger than they look!\" Kael shouted, avoiding another attack.\nTharros moved to join the fight, but his golden aura flickered and faded. The corruption in the water sapped his strength, leaving him exposed. A serpent lunged at him, its jaws wide, but Arin interrupted. Her hands glowed with dark energy as she released a blast of magic, sending the creature recoiling.\n\"Focus on staying upright,\" Arin said, her tone sharper than normal. \"We'll handle this.\"\nTharros' expression tightened, frustration flashing across his face. But he nodded, stepping back as Kael and Arin took the lead.\nSophia stayed close to the trench wall, her scanner scanning the creatures. \"Their energy patterns are linked to the corruption. If we can stop the source, it might weaken them.\"\n\"And where's the source?\" Kael asked, fending off another snake.\nSophia pointed to a pulsating mass further down the ditch. \"There. But we'll need to get past them first.\"\nKael's spear sliced through another serpent, his moves exact and unyielding. \"Then let's clear a path.\"\nArin released another wave of magic, her energy intertwining with Kael's attacks. Together, they drove the serpents back, their teamwork flawless despite the chaos.\n\"Go!\" Kael yelled to Sophia. \"We'll hold them off.\"\nSophia paused, her heart pounding. She looked at Tharros, who gave her a reassuring nod despite his weakened state.\n\"Be careful,\" he said, his voice softer than usual.\nSophia swam toward the pulsating mass, her scanner's readings getting more erratic. The energy radiating from the source was overwhelming, a chaotic swirl of corruption that seemed to claw at her very being.\nShe reached the mass, a grotesque cluster of corrupted matter that pulsed like a live heart. Sophia's hands shook as she adjusted the scanner, syncing it with the energy patterns. \"If I can destabilize this, it might disrupt the corruption.\"\nA sudden roar echoed through the trench, and Sophia turned to see a massive serpent emerge from the shadows. It was bigger than the others, its form radiating pure malice.\n\"Sophia, move!\" Kael yelled, his voice strained as he fought to reach her.\nBut the snake was too fast. It struck at her, its jaws snapping inches from her face. Sophia's instincts took over, and she triggered the scanner's energy pulse. A burst of light erupted from the device, striking the snake and forcing it back.\n\"Now or never,\" Sophia muttered, her fingers flying over the scanner's settings. The device emitted a low hum as it synchronized with the corrupted mass, its energy rising.\nThe trench trembled as the mass started to destabilize, cracks forming along its surface. The serpents writhed in pain, their moves erratic as the corruption weakened.\n\"It's working!\" Sophia yelled, her voice echoing through the chaos.\nKael and Arin fought their way to her side, their faces fierce. \"Then let's finish this,\" Kael said, driving his spear into the nearest snake.\nArin's magic flared, her energy increasing the scanner's output. The corrupted mass shattered, releasing a shockwave that rippled through the ditch. The final serpents dissolved into black mist, their forms disintegrating as the corruption faded.\nThe quiet that followed was almost deafening. The trench, once a hive of corruption, was now strangely still. Sophia's legs felt weak as she clutched the scanner, her breaths coming in rapid gasps.\nKael put a hand on her shoulder, his touch grounding. \"You did it.\"\nArin nodded, her normal sharpness replaced with something softer. \"Not bad for a surface dweller.\"\nTharros approached, his golden glow faint but steady. \"You saved us,\" he said, his voice filled with quiet pride. \"All of us.\"\nSophia met his stare, her exhaustion giving way to determination. \"We're not done yet. This was just one tunnel. The Leviathan is still out there.\"\nTharros nodded, his face hardening. \"Then we keep fighting. Together.\"\nAs they swam back toward Aquaria, the weight of the fight lingered. The Leviathan's shadow loomed larger than ever, but so did their determination. The fight was far from over, but for the first time, they felt like they had a chance.\nFar below, in the darkest depths of the abyss, the Leviathan moved. Its glowing eyes opened, its presence a cold, crushing weight. It had felt the disturbance, the weakening of its hold on the trench. But it was not crushed. Not yet.\nThe Leviathan's roar echoed through the depths, a frightening promise of what was to come.\nShadows in the Current\nThe trip back to Aquaria was laden with silence. Sophia's hands clutched the scanner, its faint hum now ominously quiet. Around her, the once vibrant waters of Aquaria shimmered with unease, the echoes of their fight still rippling through the depths. Tharros swam ahead, his golden aura dimmed but immovable. Kael trailed behind, his spear at the ready, while Arin's dark energy wrapped around her like a living shadow.\nThey reached the bioluminescent gates of Aquaria to find the city in chaos. News of the trench's rot and its purging had spread like wildfire. The people cheered their return but murmured uneasily about the Leviathan's growing danger.\nSophia stepped forward, her voice steady despite her tiredness. \"We need answers. The Leviathan isn't just striking at random. It's hunting something.\"\nArin's eyes glinted, her tone sharp. \"And if we don't find out what, this victory will mean nothing.\"\nTharros nodded, his gaze moving over the gathering crowd. \"Prepare the council. We need every resource at our disposal.\"\nIn the war room, holographic maps shimmered with data from the surface and the depths. Sophia stood at the central console, her mind racing as she integrated data from her scanner with surfaceworld analytics. The symbols and numbers flickered across the display, making a pattern that began to make her stomach twist.\n\"It's not random,\" she mumbled, her voice barely above a whisper.\nKael leaned in, his brow furrowing. \"What are you seeing?\"\nSophia pointed at the display. \"These attack sites-trenches, ruins, ancient strongholds-they're all connected. The Leviathan is moving systematically, like it's mapping something.\"\nArin's lips thinned, her fingers tracing the glowing tracks. \"A map to what?\"\n\"A power source,\" Tharros answered coldly. His tone carried the weight of old knowledge. \"A relic from the first age of Aquaria, one capable of unleashing devastation on a scale we can't imagine.\"\nThe room fell silent. Then Kael broke it, his voice cold. \"And you didn't think to mention this before?\"\nTharros' eyes hardened. \"Because I didn't think it could be found. The relic's position was buried in myth. Until now.\"\nSophia's mind spun. \"If it's following a pattern, we can predict its next move. But we'll need more data.\"\nTharros crossed his arms. \"Aquaria's archives are extensive. You'll find what you need.\"\nSophia paused. \"Not just Aquaria. I need access to surfaceworld satellites and earthquake monitors.\"\nThe room stiffened. Arin's gaze sharpened, and Kael's face darkened. Tharros' speech was low, measured. \"You'd risk exposing our world?\"\n\"We don't have a choice,\" Sophia said, meeting his eyes. \"The Leviathan doesn't care about your traditions or secrecy. If it finds that treasure, there won't be an Aquaria left to protect.\"\nA tense silence followed. Finally, Tharros sighed, his shoulders loosening. \"Do what you must. But step carefully, Sophia. Trust is fragile here.\"\nHours later, Sophia sat in her makeshift lab, a darkly lit room filled with blinking monitors and swirling holograms. She adjusted the uplink device on her wrist, her heart pounding as she connected to her former surfaceworld peers. The familiar face of Dr. Chen showed on the screen, his eyes widening in shock.\n\"Sophia? Where the hell have you been?\" he demanded.\n\"It's a long story,\" she said quickly. \"But I need your help. It's about the deepsea seismic readings we examined last year.\"\nDr. Chen's brow wrinkled. \"Those anomalies? We've been seeing more of them lately. Spiking near underwater power lines and Sophia, are you in a submarine?\"\nShe paused. \"Something like that. Just send me everything you have. Patterns, numbers, anything.\"\nHe stared at her, suspicion and worry warring in his eyes. \"You're not telling me everything. What's going on?\"\nSophia's voice relaxed. \"Chen, please. I'll explain later. Right now, lives depend on this.\"",

        "content": "After a long pause, he nodded. \"Alright. Sending the info now. But Sophia, be careful.\"\nThe link cut, and Sophia exhaled, her fingers flying over the console as she integrated the surface data with Aquaria's archives. The patterns began to coalesce, making a trail that led her heart sank.\n\"The next target is here,\" she whispered. \"Aquaria itself.\"\nThe council met in chaos. The revelation of the Leviathan's impending attack sent shockwaves through the chamber. Traditionalists denounced the use of surfaceworld technology, their voices rising in anger.\n\"You've brought the surface down upon us!\" one elder yelled.\n\"Enough!\" Tharros' voice boomed, silencing the room. His golden eyes burned with power. \"Sophia's methods may be unconventional, but they have saved us before. We will not let bias blind us now.\"\nKael stepped forward, his spear hitting the ground for emphasis. \"If the Leviathan is coming, we need every advantage we can get. We're out of time for debates.\"\nArin's voice cut through like a blade. \"And if we fail, there won't be a council left to argue.\"\nSophia stood at the middle, feeling the weight of their gazes. \"We can prepare. We know its pattern. We know its goal. But we need to act now.\"\nTharros nodded. \"Then let us begin.\"\nThe city became a hive of activity. Soldiers armed themselves, magical barriers were strengthened, and Sophia worked tirelessly to finetune the defense plan. Her heart raced as she coordinated with both surface satellites and Aquarian magic, closing the gap between two worlds.\nAs the hours ticked by, a sense of foreboding fell over her. Tharros found her at the edge of the city, looking into the dark expanse of the ocean.\n\"You're carrying too much,\" he said softly.\nShe glanced at him, her eyes tired but determined. \"I have to. If we fail\"\n\"We won't.\" His speech was firm, his presence grounding. \"You're not alone in this, Sophia. Remember that.\"\nShe managed a faint smile. \"I'll try.\"\nThe attack came at dawn. The waters darkened as the Leviathan's shadow rose over the city. Its roar shattered the silence, a sound that reverberated through bone and stone alike.\nThe fight was chaos. Soldiers fought with corrupted creatures, their weapons glowing with enchantments. Arin's magic crackled in the air, weaving through the fray like a live thing. Kael led the charge, his spear a blur of deadly accuracy.\nSophia worked from the command center, her hands flying over the controls as she directed energy pulses and planned defenses. But her heart sank as she watched the Leviathan press closer, its massive form shrugging off their charges like gnats.\n\"It's too strong,\" she whispered, fear creeping into her voice.\n\"No,\" Tharros said, his voice steady beside her. \"We're stronger. Together.\"\nHe put a hand on her shoulder, and she felt the surge of his power flow into her. It was raw, overwhelming, but she channeled it, her own energy rising to meet his. The console flared to life, its lights blazing as the city's defenses roared back to full power.\nOutside, the Leviathan faltered, its moves slowing as the combined might of Aquaria pushed it back. But just as hope began to bloom, the creature's eyes burned brighter, its body shifting with a new, scary energy.\nSophia's heart stopped as the monitors blared a single word: \"Eruption.\"\nThe Leviathan let out a final, deafening roar, and the ocean floor beneath Aquaria started to tremble. Sophia's blood ran cold as she realized the truth.\n\"It's not just attacking,\" she whispered. \"It's waking something.\"\nFractured Trust\nThe tremors beneath Aquaria grew stronger, the very seabed quivering with a force that seemed to echo the Leviathan's rage. Sophia stood frozen in the command center, her mind running. The word \"eruption\" still blinked eerily on the console. She turned to Tharros, her words urgent.\n\"We need to evacuate the outer districts. Now.\"\nTharros nodded, his golden eyes stiffening. \"Kael, take the guard. Arin, seal the barrier spells.\"\nKael's jaw clenched, but he didn't pause. \"On it.\"\nArin cast a glance at Sophia, a flicker of worry breaking through her usual composure. \"Be careful,\" she said before fleeing into the chaos.\nSophia felt Tharros' steady presence beside her. \"What are we missing?\" he asked softly.\nHer fingers tightened on the console. \"This isn't just a physical attack. The Leviathan is spreading fear and division. If it succeeds, we'll kill ourselves from within.\"\nBy the time the first refugees were led into the central dome, rumors had already spread. Whispers of sabotage, of betrayal within the palace, ran through the crowd like a dangerous current. Sophia caught snippets as she moved through the hallways.\n\"They knew where to strike\"\n\"Someone's feeding it information\"\n\"How else could it breach the barriers?\"\nSophia's heart sank. Mistrust was a poison that could weaken them faster than any monster. She found Kael in the armory, his expression dark as he gave orders to his warriors.\n\"Kael,\" she called, drawing him away. \"We need to address this now.\"\nHis eyes narrowed. \"You think I'm not trying? My men are scared. If there's a spy, they don't know who to trust.\"\n\"We need proof,\" Sophia said strongly. \"Accusations will tear us apart. If the Leviathan has someone on the inside, we have to find them before it's too late.\"\nKael's jaw tensed. \"And if we can't?\"\nSophia's voice relaxed. \"We will. We have to.\"\nThe palace felt colder than usual that night. Sophia couldn't shake the sense of being watched as she worked in her lab, studying the latest readings. The Leviathan's energy signature was erratic, as if it were feeding off the chaos in Aquaria. Her thoughts were interrupted by a faint knock at the door.\n\"Come in,\" she said without looking up.\nArin slipped inside, her face unreadable. \"You look like you haven't slept in days.\"\n\"I haven't,\" Sophia revealed. \"But neither has anyone else.\"\nArin leaned against the wall, her dark aura pulsing slightly. \"You think this spy is real, don't you?\"\nSophia paused. \"I don't want to believe it. But the Leviathan has been one step ahead of us. That can't be a coincidence.\"\nArin's eyes narrowed. \"And what happens when you find them? What if it's someone close to you?\"\nSophia's chest tightened. \"I don't know. But we can't let it break us. Unity is our only chance.\"\nArin nodded slowly. \"Then you'd better find them fast.\"\nThe next morning, chaos erupted in the council room. An explosion in the eastern district had left dozens wounded, the shimmering barriers compromised. Tharros stood at the head of the table, his presence dominant but tense.\n\"This was no accident,\" he said, his voice cold. \"Someone here is working against us.\"\nThe room exploded in angry voices. Accusations flew, each council member casting suspicious looks at their peers. Sophia felt the tension building like a storm about to break.\n\"Enough!\" she yelled, her voice cutting through the noise. \"Fighting each other won't solve this. We need to focus.\"\nOne adult glared at her. \"Easy for you to say. You're the outsider here. How do we know you're not the traitor?\"\nSophia's heart pounded, but she stood her ground. \"Because I've been risking my life to protect this city. I've fought beside you. If we keep tearing each other apart, we're doing the Leviathan's work for it.\"\nTharros raised a hand, quiet the room. \"Sophia is right. We cannot let fear dictate our deeds. But we must find the spy. And we will.\"\nLater that day, Sophia joined Kael and Arin in the war room. The air between them was tense, the weight of suspicion weighing heavily on all of them.\n\"I've been going over the security feeds,\" Sophia said, her voice steady. \"There's a gap in the footage from the eastern district-right before the explosion.\"\nKael's eyes darkened. \"A deliberate wipe?\"\n\"Most likely,\" Sophia stated. \"Whoever did this knew exactly what they were doing.\"\nArin crossed her arms. \"So we're looking for someone with access to the palace's security systems. That narrows it down.\"\nKael's eyes flicked to Arin. \"Or someone with magic strong enough to bypass them.\"\nThe charge hung in the air, unspoken but heavy. Arin's eyes flashed, her words dangerously calm. \"Careful, Kael.\"\nSophia stepped between them, her voice strong. \"Stop. This is exactly what the Leviathan wants. We're stronger together, remember?\"\nKael looked away, his jaw tight. Arin's face softened, though her eyes still glinted with anger.\n\"Fine,\" Kael grumbled. \"What's our next move?\"\nSophia breathed. \"We set a trap. Let's see if the spy takes the bait.\"\nThe plan was simple but risky. Sophia shared false information about a critical weakness in Aquaria's defenses, ensuring it reached the ears of every council member. Then they waited.\nHours passed with painful slowness. Sophia paced the command center, her nerves frayed. Tharros stood close, his presence a steadying force.\n\"They'll take the bait,\" he said softly.\n\"And if they don't?\" Sophia asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\"They will,\" he repeated, his golden eyes steadfast.\nFinally, the alarm sounded. A transmission had been intercepted, the false information passed to an unknown source. Sophia's heart raced as she followed the signal's trail, her hands flying over the panel.\n\"Got it,\" she said. \"The message was sent from inside the palace.\"\nTharros' eyes darkened. \"Who?\"\nSophia paused, her stomach twisting. The numbers didn't lie. She turned the screen to face him, her voice heavy with disbelief.\n\"It was one of the council members.\"\nThe rogue was brought before the council that night. The elder's face was pale, their eyes darting nervously as the charges were read aloud. Sophia watched the room, noting the mixture of anger, betrayal, and fear on every face.\n\"Why?\" Tharros demanded, his words cutting through the tense silence.\nThe elder shook. \"I thought I thought I could deal with it. Save myself. Save my family.\"\n\"You endangered everyone,\" Kael snarled, his hands clenched. \"Your cowardice could have destroyed us.\"\nSophia's voice was softer, but no less strong. \"The Leviathan doesn't make bargains. It consumes.\"\nThe elder broke down, crying. \"I didn't mean for it to go this far.\"\nTharros stepped forward, his face cold. \"You have betrayed Aquaria. There will be consequences.\"\nThe elder was taken away, leaving the room in heavy quiet. Sophia turned to the group, her voice steady despite the chaos in her heart.\n\"We can't let this divide us,\" she said. \"If we do, the Leviathan wins.\"\nTharros nodded, his eyes meeting hers. \"Unity is our greatest weapon. We must hold fast.\"\nThat night, as Sophia sat alone in her quarters, a chilling thought struck her. The intercepted message had been too easy to follow, the trail too clean. She replayed the data, her heart sinking as she spotted the oddity.\n\"This wasn't just a spy,\" she whispered. \"It was a distraction.\"\nA sudden roar rang through the city, the sound of barriers shattering. Sophia's blood ran cold as she rushed to the window, her breath stopping at the sight.\nThe Leviathan had returned, and this time, it wasn't alone.\nProphecy Interpreted\nThe Leviathan's roars could be heard all over Aquaria, and its shadowy shape looked bigger than ever. Sophia ran through the palace rooms, her heart beating so fast that she could hear it. The ground was shaking with the same speed as her heart. The walls around the city flickered, and their glowing shields broke under the huge attack.\nArin stood in the old library. Her dark magic made the walls look creepy with shadows. She hunched over a broken tablet that had strange symbols written on it and gave off a faint glow when she touched it. As Sophia rushed in, gasping for air, the faint hum of old magic got stronger.\nSophia called out, \"Arin.\" Her voice was rough. \"What did you find?\"\nThe wolf didn't look up. Her eyes were locked on the swirling writing, her fingers tracing the lines with urgency. Her voice was low but firm as she said, \"It's the prophecy.\" \"The one the Whale Song Seers spoke of.\"\nSophia stepped closer, the weight of the words pushing on her chest. \"What does it say?\"\nArin's jaw clenched, her normal sharpness replaced by a rare flicker of hesitation. \"It speaks of a bridge, a bond between two worlds. It's the only way to seal the Leviathan.\"\nSophia frowned. \"Seal? Not destroy?\"\nArin shook her head. \"The Leviathan is primal chaos. It can't be killed, only contained. And the cost\" Her voice faltered, her eyes finally lifting to meet Sophia's.\n\"The cost is you.\"\nThe war room was nervous. Tharros paced, his golden eyes burning with frustration, while Kael stood by the map table, his face as cold as the abyss. Arin sat quietly, her fingers wrapped tightly around the tablet. Sophia's heart ached as she saw the fear etched on each face.\n\"There has to be another way,\" Kael said, breaking the quiet. \"We can't just accept this.\"\nArin's speech was calm but firm. \"This isn't about acceptance. It's about understanding. The message is clear. Sophia is the bridge. Without her, the Leviathan cannot be contained.\"\nTharros stopped pacing, his eyes fixed on Arin. \"You're asking us to sacrifice her. That's not a price I'm willing to pay.\"\nSophia gulped hard, the weight of their words pressing down on her. \"We don't even know what it means yet. Let's not jump to conclusions.\"\nKael's fists clenched. \"Prophecies are riddles. They're meant to confuse and mislead. We need a real plan, not blind faith.\"\nArin's eyes narrowed. \"Do you think I want this? I've been looking over these texts for hours. Everything points to Sophia. She's not just part of the forecast; she's the key.\"\nThe room fell silent again, the air thick with anxiety. Sophia took a deep breath, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. \"We don't have time to argue. The Leviathan is already breaking through our defenses. If I'm the key, we need to figure out how to use that.\"\nSophia found herself alone with Tharros in the quiet of the observation room. The glow of Aquaria's bioluminescent towers filtered through the water, leaving shimmering patterns on the walls. Tharros stood at the window, his shoulders tense, his hands clasped behind his back.\n\"You're angry,\" Sophia said softly, stepping closer.\nHe turned, his golden eyes piercing. \"I'm more than angry. I'm furious. At the forecast. At the Leviathan. At myself for not being able to protect you.\"\nSophia's chest tightened. \"I'm not asking for protection, Tharros. I'm asking for trust. If this is what it takes to save Aquaria, I have to try.\"\n\"And if it costs you your life?\" His voice cracked, the vulnerability cutting through his usual stoic attitude.\nShe reached out, putting a hand on his arm. \"We don't know what it will cost yet. But if we do nothing, everyone will pay the price. You taught me that sometimes we have to make sacrifices for the greater good.\"\nTharros' face softened, his hand covering hers. \"Then we'll face it together. Whatever happens.\"\nBack in the library, Arin spread out the tablet alongside scrolls of old Whale Song records. Kael stood by, his arms crossed, while Sophia leaned over the glowing symbols, trying to make sense of the mysterious text.\n\"The bridge,\" Sophia whispered. \"It has to mean more than just a connection.\"\nArin nodded. \"The text implies a merging of forces. Surface and sea, magic and science. You're the only one who embodies all those elements.\"\nKael's jaw tensed. \"And what happens when this bridge is formed? Does she just vanish?\"\nArin's silence was answer enough. Kael slammed his hand on the table, the sound echoing through the chamber. \"This is madness.\"\n\"Kael,\" Sophia said gently, her voice steady despite the fear eating at her. \"We're wasting time. The Leviathan is getting stronger. If we don't move, we'll lose everything.\"\nKael's gaze softened as he looked at her, his anger giving way to raw feeling. \"I just don't want to lose you.\"\nSophia managed a small smile. \"You won't. Not if we do this right.\"\nAs the hours passed, the pieces began to fall into place. The ancient texts spoke of a ritual, a convergence of energies that would create a seal strong enough to contain the Leviathan. It needed a focal point-the bridge-to channel the combined forces of magic and technology.\nSophia stood at the middle of the war room, her voice steady as she laid out the plan. \"We'll use the palace's core as the ritual site. Its energy amplifiers can transmit the magic. Arin, you'll hold the spell. Tharros and Kael, your power will settle it. And I\" She stopped, her gaze sweeping over them. \"I'll be the conduit.\"\nTharros stepped forward. \"You're asking us to risk everything on a prophecy.\"\nSophia met his eyes. \"I'm asking you to trust me.\"\nKael nodded reluctantly. \"If this is what it takes, we'll do it.\"\nArin's speech was softer than usual. \"Then we'd better not fail.\"\nThe Leviathan's attack intensified as the ritual started. The city shook under the force of its rage, the barriers flickering dangerously. Inside the core chamber, the air was thick with magic and anxiety.\nSophia stood in the middle of the glowing platform, her heart pounding as the energy swirled around her. Arin's chants filled the room, her magic weaving intricate patterns that shimmered in the air. Tharros and Kael stood at opposite ends, their power rushing into the spell.\nThe Leviathan's roar echoed through the depths, a sound that made Sophia's blood run cold. She closed her eyes, focusing on the link between them all. She felt the pull of the surface, the weight of the sea, the raw power of magic and science converging within her.\n\"Almost there,\" Arin said, her voice strained. \"Hold on.\"\nThe energy reached its peak, a blinding light filling the room. Sophia's body shook as the forces coursed through her, threatening to tear her apart. But she held on, her mind fixed on the faces of those she was fighting for.\nThen, just as the light began to dim, a new sound cut through the chaos. A crack, like breaking glass. Sophia's eyes flew open, her heart sinking as she saw the platform beneath her splintering.\n\"Something's wrong,\" she whispered.\nThe Leviathan's roar got louder, its form pressing closer to the city. Sophia's gaze met Tharros', a single thought passing between them.\n\"It's not enough.\"\nTrial by Magic\nThe platform underneath Sophia moaned, fissures appearing quicker than anybody could respond. The rush of magic in the chamber changed dangerously, the brilliance in the air diminishing as the Leviathan's roar became louder. Tharros was the first to move, his golden aura radiating as he reached for Sophia.\n\"Sophia, get back!\" He yelled, his voice cutting through the commotion.\nBut before she could react, the energy surrounding her twisted. A burst of strength swept upward, swallowing her fully. The last thing she saw was Tharros' anguished gaze as the light engulfed everything.\nWhen the light faded, Sophia found herself in a completely different environment. The room was vanished, replaced by an infinite sea of gleaming water. She floats weightlessly, her movements sluggish and dreamy. The silence was unsettling, pressing against her ears.\n\"Where am I?\" She murmured, her voice unusually quiet.\nA person appeared in front of her, moving and flickering like a mirror in rippling water. It was Arin, but not quite. Her features were sharper, and her eyes shone with an intensity Sophia had never seen.\n\"This is your trial,\" the apparition repeated, her voice echoing. \"A test to prove you are ready to wield Aquaria's magic.\"\nSophia's heart pounded. \"Trial? I do not comprehend. \"What's going on?\"\nThe spectral Arin inclined her head. \"You have been chosen as the bridge, but your connection is not complete. To fight the Leviathan, you must first confront yourself.\nSophia opened her mouth to complain, but the figure raised a hand, causing the water surrounding her to move. Shapes began to appear in the distance, fuzzy and indistinct. As they got closer, Sophia's chest clenched. They were memories-fragments from her past, experiences she had hidden deep.\nThe first scene settled within the clean white walls of a research facility. Sophia recognized it immediately. The room where she first saw Tharros in his dragon form. She saw herself standing near the containment tank, her countenance a mix of astonishment and horror.\nTharros' memory version hissed, his golden scales gleaming as he lunged for the glass. Sophia flinched, the memories stinging deeper than she anticipated. She'd been horrified at the time, unsure how to reconcile her scientific interest with the inescapable reality of his sentience.\n\"You doubted him,\" the apparition's voice repeated. \"You doubted yourself.\"\nSophia clinched her fist. \"I wasn't sure what to trust. Everything I believed I knew about the universe was broken in that moment.\"\nThe phantom moved closer, her gaze piercing. \"And now?\" \"Do you believe?\"\nSophia met her gaze, her words steady. \"Yes. I have seen what's at risk. I believe in Tharros. In Aquaria. I believe in myself.\nThe memories faded, and the scene melted into the ocean. Sophia didn't have time to regain her breath before the next one appeared.\nShe was back in the trenches, with the corrupted serpents crawling through the murky blackness. Her scanner buzzed furiously in her hand as the throbbing mass of depravity approached. Sophia's gut churned as she noticed herself hesitating, her fingers quivering as she adjusted the device.\n\"You were afraid,\" the phantom stated, her tone harsh. \"I am afraid of failure. Afraid to be weak.\"\nSophia's jaw stiffened. \"Of course, I was scared. But I didn't let that stop me.\nThe phantom motioned toward the scene. \"Show me.\"\nSophia took a deep breath and stepped into the recollection. The serpents snarled as their perverted forms lunged toward her. This time, she did not falter. She raised the scanner, her hands firm, and initiated the pulse. The energy exploded outward, striking the bulk and pushing the monsters back.\nAs the memories faded, the apparition's expression softened. \"You're stronger than you realize. But strength alone is insufficient.\"\nThe final sequence was the most challenging. Sophia stood at her childhood home, the familiar creak of the floorboards beneath her boots. Her parents' voices resonated through the kitchen, their tone light and playful. But she knew how this recollection would end.\nShe witnessed her younger self-only fifteen-argue with her father over her future.\n\"You can't live your life chasing the impossible,\" her father had said. \"Science has its limits, Sophia.\"\n\"Limits?\" Sophia had responded, her voice shaking. \"That is exactly why I need to keep pushing. \"Someone has to believe in more.\"\nThe argument had marked the beginning of a schism that had never fully mended. Her father's words had sown seeds of doubt that remained, hinting that she was seeking a dream too huge to achieve.",

        "content": "The apparition's words interrupted her thoughts. \"Do you still believe?\"\nSophia's throat clenched, but she simply nodded. \"Yes. And not only in science. In magic. It's possible. I believe we can make the impossible a reality.\nHer memories faded, leaving her alone with the phantom. The ethereal creature moved closer, her luminous eyes piercing.\n\"You've faced your worries. You have doubts. Your past. Now you must decide whether to let them go.\"\nSophia closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. The weight of her concerns was thick, but as she inhaled, she imagined them dissolving into the water surrounding her. She opened her eyes, and the apparition smiled.\n\"You are ready,\" she said.\nThe trial concluded as abruptly as it began. Sophia's eyes shot open, and she was back in the core room. Tharros, Kael, and Arin surrounded her with expressions of relief and worry.\n\"You're back,\" Tharros replied, his voice full of emotion.\nSophia nodded, her body quivering but her determination as strong as ever. \"I'm ready.\"\nArin's eyes met hers, and a rare grin softened her severe features. \"You passed the trial.\" \"The magic is yours now.\"\nSophia could sense it-a connection to the water, to the energy coursing through Aquaria. It was as if the city itself was alive inside her, its power coursing through her veins.\nKael moved forward, his hand briefly resting on her shoulder. \"We're with you, every step of the way.\"\nThe Leviathan's roar resonated again, a chilling reminder of the impending confrontation. Sophia straightened, her dread replaced with purpose.\n\"Then let's finish this,\" she said.\nFar underneath the city, the Leviathan shook, its gigantic shape coiling as if feeling a change in the currents. Its eyes burned brighter, and its howl echoed across the depths. Sophia's trial had strengthened her, yet the Leviathan's power remained unabated.\nAs the troop prepared for their final stand, Aquaria fell into an unsettling silence. The prophecy weighed heavily on them all, but Sophia's determination was unwavering. She confronted her anxieties and uncertainties and emerged stronger. Now it was time to face the darkness that threatened to destroy their planet.\nThis time, she would not fail.\nTharros’ Doubts\nThe Leviathan's distant roar echoed through the water, a haunting warning of what loomed ahead. Within the coralwalled chamber, Tharros stood at the edge of a balcony, his eyes fixed on the glowing spires of Aquaria. The city's bioluminescent glow pulsed slightly, as if mirroring the unease in his chest.\nSophia's words remained in his mind. \"I'm ready.\" She had spoken with such conviction, her resolve unshakable. But the image of her standing in the middle of that ritual, her body trembling as ancient magic coursed through her, refused to leave his thoughts. The oracle had marked her as the bridge, the key to saving their world. Yet all he could see was the danger she faced.\nTharros' claws flexed against the stone railing, his dragon instincts urging him to shield her, to keep her away from danger. But how could he protect someone so willing to risk everything? Someone he cared for far more than he'd ever admitted aloud.\nThe soft sound of coming footsteps broke his reverie. Kael's voice, low and steady, reached him. \"You're brooding again.\"\nTharros didn't turn. \"And you're still watching me.\"\nKael leaned against the wall, his spear resting at his side. \"You're the king. Watching you comes with the job.\"\nThe faint attempt at humor went flat. Tharros' shoulders tensed as he glanced back at his old friend. \"Do you ever doubt her?\"\nKael's expression relaxed. \"Doubt? No. Worry? Every moment.\"\n\"She's brave to the point of recklessness,\" Tharros mumbled. \"I can't ignore the risk. If she falls\" He trailed off, unable to finish the thought.\nKael stepped closer, his tone unusually gentle. \"You can't stop her. You know that. Sophia's not someone who waits for permission. She'll do what needs to be done, no matter the cost.\"\nTharros turned away, his gaze falling to the faraway currents beyond the city's edge. \"And that terrifies me.\"\nSophia's rooms were quiet when Tharros entered, the faint hum of magical wards the only sound. She sat crosslegged on the floor, surrounded by glowing designs and scattered notes. Her hair was damp, and she wore a simple robe, a rare moment of calm amidst the chaos.\nShe looked up, her lips twisting into a small smile. \"Couldn't sleep either?\"\nTharros shook his head, his golden eyes searching the room. \"There's too much to think about.\"\nSophia gestured for him to sit, and he dropped himself onto a nearby cushion. For a moment, they sat in silence, the weight of unsaid thoughts hanging between them.\n\"You're worried,\" she said softly, breaking the quiet.\n\"Of course I'm worried,\" Tharros replied, his tone sharper than he meant. \"You're throwing yourself into a prophecy that might kill you. How could I not be?\"\nSophia's smile faded, replaced by a look of quiet understanding. \"I don't want to die, Tharros. But if my life is the price for saving this world, it's one I'm willing to pay.\"\n\"You shouldn't have to pay it,\" he said, his voice low. \"You've already given so much. It isn't fair.\"\nSophia reached out, her hand resting lightly on his. \"Fairness doesn't matter right now. What matters is doing what's right.\"\nTharros looked down at her hand, his chest tightening. \"You're more important than you realize,\" he said softly. \"Not just to Aquaria. To me.\"\nHer breath hitched, her eyes meeting his. \"Tharros\"\nHe pulled back, breaking the connection before the moment could grow. \"I can't lose you, Sophia. Not now. Not ever.\"\nThe following day, Tharros met with Kael and Arin in the war room. The tension between them was obvious, the weight of the Leviathan's looming threat pressing heavily on them all. Arin's sharp gaze flicked to Tharros as he entered, her face unreadable.\n\"You look like you didn't sleep,\" she noted, her tone edged with something between concern and annoyance.\n\"I didn't,\" Tharros answered bluntly. \"We need to reconsider our approach. The rite isn't ready. Sophia's connection to the magic is still too new.\"\nKael frowned. \"What are you suggesting? That we wait? Because the Leviathan won't.\"\n\"I'm suggesting we find another way,\" Tharros said firmly. \"There has to be something we're missing.\"\nArin's voice was cold. \"The prophecy is clear. Sophia is the bridge. Without her, there is no other way.\"\n\"And if the prophecy is wrong?\" Tharros countered, his voice rising. \"What if it's leading us to sacrifice her for nothing?\"\nArin's face darkened. \"Prophecies don't lie. They're just difficult to understand. But this one has been confirmed by every source we have.\"\n\"That doesn't make it infallible,\" Tharros countered. \"I won't gamble her life on a maybe.\"\nKael stepped between them, his words calm but firm. \"Enough. We're on the same side. Let's focus on what we can do to ensure the ritual works. Arguing won't help anyone.\"\nLater, Tharros found himself in the training grounds, watching as Sophia sparred with Kael. Her actions were sharper now, more confident, though still unpolished. Kael's guidance was firm but patient, his speech steady as he corrected her stances.\nTharros' chest tightened as he watched her fall, then recover. She was trying so hard, pushing herself beyond her limits. It was inspiring-and sad.\nWhen the session finished, Sophia approached him, her breaths heavy but her eyes bright. \"How did I do?\"\n\"Better,\" he admitted. \"But you're still pushing too hard.\"\nShe laughed softly, wiping sweat from her face. \"There's no time to take it easy.\"\nTharros frowned. \"Pushing yourself to the point of collapse won't help anyone.\"\nSophia's smile faded. \"Is that what this is about? You don't think I'm ready?\"\n\"It's not that,\" he said quickly. \"I just I don't want you to get hurt.\"\nShe put a hand on his arm, her touch grounding. \"I'm scared too, Tharros. But fear can't stop us. We have to face it. Together.\"\nHis golden eyes met hers, the weight of his feelings threatening to spill over. \"Then promise me you'll be careful. Promise me you won't take needless risks.\"\nSophia's gaze softened. \"I promise to do everything I can to survive. But I won't back down from what needs to be done.\"\nAs the sun's light faded, casting Aquaria in a deep, calm blue, Tharros stood once more on the balcony. His thoughts churned, a storm of doubt and determination. He knew the fight ahead would test them all-their strength, their unity, their faith in one another.\nSophia had made her choice. Now, he had to make his. The Leviathan's presence was a darkness that threatened to consume everything, but Tharros discovered the truth that had been nagging at him all along.\nSophia wasn't just the bridge between land and sea. She was the bridge between hope and despair, between surrender and fight. And if she could face her fears, then so could he.\nAs the faraway roar of the Leviathan echoed once more, Tharros straightened, his golden aura flickering to life. The battle was coming, and he would fight with everything he had. For Aquaria. For their future. For her.\nKael’s Legacy\nThe royal halls were silent, but there was a feeling of tension in the air, like a warning that was not said out loud. Kael's footsteps made soft sounds as he walked through the dark halls, his mind filled with mixed feelings. The Leviathan towered over their world, but he was now facing a truth he had tried to hide for years. A secret that could either save Aquaria or destroy its delicate balance.\nHe tightened his hands as he approached the door to the council archive. The weight of the news felt heavy on his heart. His background, which even Tharros didn't know about, was crucial for gathering a strong group to support them. But sharing it would reopen old issues and create more problems in an already unstable political situation.\nKael opened the door, and the smell of old paper and saltwater filled the air. The room was lined with shelves of glowing scrolls, the knowledge of generations stored within their enchanted fibers. At the middle of the room, Sophia stood over a table, her brow furrowed as she pored over a map marked with sigils. She looked up as he entered, her face softening.\n\"You've been avoiding me,\" she said gently.\nKael paused, then sighed. \"Not you. Everyone.\"\nSophia signaled for him to join her. \"Want to talk about it?\"\nHe sat across from her, the glow of the map sending shadows across his sharp features. \"There's something you need to know. Something I've kept hidden for a long time.\"\nSophia tilted her head, her interest piqued. \"What is it?\"\nKael's voice was quiet, almost a whisper. \"My bloodline isn't what everyone believes. I'm not just a fighting prince. I I'm the rightful heir to the southern merkingdoms. The royal blood of both lands flows through me.\"\nSophia blinked, stunned into silence for a moment. \"You're saying you're\"\n\"A king,\" Kael finished, his voice bitter. \"By blood, anyway. But I've never claimed the title. I never wanted it.\"\nThe room seemed to hold its breath as Kael's statement sank in. Sophia's mind raced, piecing together the consequences.\n\"Kael, this changes everything,\" she said eventually. \"The southern merkingdoms have been neutral in this fight. If they knew about your heritage\"\nKael's jaw tensed. \"If they knew, it would throw their entire political system into chaos. The present rulers would see me as a threat. It could upset everything.\"\nSophia leaned forward, her eyes searching his. \"But it could also unite them. They might follow you, Kael. This could be the turning point we need.\"\nHe shook his head, frustration written into his features. \"You don't understand. I've spent my life showing myself as a warrior, not a king. I never wanted to lead. I never wanted the crown.\"\nSophia reached across the table, her hand covering his. \"Sometimes, leadership isn't about wanting it. It's about stepping up when no one else can. Right now, Aquaria needs every friend we can get. If your influence can bring them to our side, we have to try.\"\nKael looked down at her hand, the warmth of her touch grounding him. \"And what if it backfires? What if claiming my background divides them instead of uniting them?\"\nSophia's speech was steady, her conviction clear. \"Then we deal with it together. But doing nothing isn't a choice. You have the strength to lead, Kael. I've seen it. Now it's time for them to see it too.\"\nThe next morning, Kael stood before the council, his face stoic but his heart pounding. Tharros and Arin flanked him, their presence both a comfort and a warning of the stakes. Sophia watched from the shadows, her silent support giving him the strength to speak.\n\"There's something you all need to know,\" Kael started, his voice steady despite the tension in the room. \"I've kept this secret for a long time, but with the Leviathan threatening everything we hold dear, I can't stay silent any longer.\"\nThe council members murmured, their interest piqued. Kael took a deep breath, his gaze sweeping over the room.\n\"I am Kael Stormwind, heir to the southern merkingdoms. The blood of two royal lines flows through me. And I am taking my birthright, not for myself, but for Aquaria.\"\nThe room exploded into shocked whispers. Tharros' eyes narrowed, his expression unreadable, while Arin's lips curved into a faint, approving smile.\nOne elder stood, his voice sharp. \"This is treason! You've kept this hidden from us, and now you expect us to trust you?\"\nKael met the elder's stare headon. \"I expect you to do what's right for Aquaria. The southern merkingdoms have the resources and troops we need to stand against the Leviathan. If my history can unite them, I will use it. But I'm not asking for your trust. I'll earn it.\"\nAfter the council gathering, Kael found Sophia in the palace gardens, her presence a welcome reprieve from the storm of politics. She sat by a glowing coral fountain, the light making soft shadows on her face.\n\"How did it go?\" she asked as he neared.\nKael sighed, sitting beside her. \"Better than I expected. Worse than I hoped. They're skeptical, but they'll back the plan. For now.\"\nSophia smiled weakly. \"That's a start. You did the right thing, Kael.\"\nHe looked at her, his expression thoughtful. \"You always seem so sure of yourself. How do you do it?\"\nShe laughed softly. \"I'm not sure of myself. I just fake it until I figure it out.\"\nKael laughed, the tension in his shoulders easing. \"You're a good liar, then.\"\nSophia's gaze softened. \"I believe in you, Kael. And I'm not the only one. You have what it takes to lead, even if you don't see it yet.\"\nHe looked away, the weight of her words resting over him. \"I hope you're right. For all our sakes.\"\nAs night fell, Kael stood on the balcony viewing Aquaria. The bright city below seemed almost peaceful, belying the chaos that brewed beneath the surface. He clenched the edge of the railing, the enormity of his choice pressing down on him.\nSophia's words echoed in his mind. Leadership wasn't about wanting it; it was about stepping up. He had made his choice. Now he had to live with it.\nThe sound of distant drums reached his ears, signaling the coming of a southern delegation. Kael straightened, his face hardening. His secret was out, and there was no going back.\nFar beneath the city, the Leviathan stirred, its massive form coiling with expectation. The battle for Aquaria was just starting.\nArin’s Sacrifice\nThe sound of the southern delegation's drums was still barely heard in Aquaria when the first crack showed up in the city's walls. A strong shake shook the towers, making the streets feel uneasy. The bioluminescent light faded briefly, as if the city had taken a tired breath.\nArin started moving before the alarms went off. She stood in the middle of the council room, her dark eyes looking over the map that flashed with urgent red lights.\n\"It's the Leviathan,\" she said sharply. \"It's pushing the limits again.\"\nTharros frowned, his golden aura flickering as he leaned over the map. \"The barriers are holding for now, but if it keeps probing, they won't last.\"",

        "content": "Kael moved ahead, his spear touching the ground. \"We have strengthened our defenses in every way possible.\" What else can we do?\"\nAll eyes turned to Arin. Her presence was a steady force in the chaos, but Sophia could see the faint tension in her moves. Arin's power had always been formidable, but even she had boundaries.\n\"There's one more spell,\" Arin said finally, her tone precise. \"A reinforcement ritual that could stabilize the barriers.\"\nTharros' eyes sharpened. \"Why haven't we used it already?\"\nArin hesitated, her fingers brushing over the edge of the map. \"Because it's dangerous. It requires channeling a significant amount of energy and it will drain me completely.\"\nThe room fell silent. Sophia's heart clenched as she stepped closer. \"Arin, there has to be another way. You've already pushed yourself too far.\"\nArin's lips curved into a faint, wry smile. \"You're sweet, Sophia. But we don't have time for options. If the Leviathan breaks through, Aquaria is finished.\"\nKael's voice was low, his concern obvious. \"You don't have to do this alone. Let us help.\"\n\"This spell doesn't work that way,\" Arin said strongly. \"It's my magic. My problem. I can handle it.\"\nThe ritual was set up in the grand atrium, the largest open area in the city. Glowing lines etched into the coral floor pulsed with Arin's dark energy as she prepared the spell. Sophia, Tharros, and Kael stood nearby, their worry palpable.\nSophia stepped forward, her words quiet but insistent. \"Arin, please. At least let me stay with you.\"\nArin glanced at her, her face softening. \"You've got a big heart, surface girl. But this isn't your fight.\"\n\"It is,\" Sophia said firmly. \"We're in this together. If something goes wrong, someone needs to be here.\"\nArin paused, then nodded. \"Fine. But keep your distance. This spell it's not exactly gentle.\"\nTharros stepped closer, his golden aura shimmering softly. \"Be careful, Arin. You're too important to lose.\"\nArin's smile was fleeting, her attention already shifting to the runes. \"I'll try not to disappoint you, Your Majesty.\"\nKael's hand tensed around his spear. \"If you need anything-\"\n\"I'll let you know,\" Arin interrupted. \"Now get back. This is going to get messy.\"\nThe air grew thick as Arin began the chant. Her voice was steady, each word echoing with power that rippled through the atrium. The runes flared brighter, the light almost blinding. Sophia protected her eyes, her heart pounding as the energy surged.\nArin's dark magic curled around her like living shadows, weaving into the barriers that surrounded Aquaria. The city's defenses glowed brighter in reaction, their faltering strength stabilizing under her influence. But Sophia could see the strain on Arin's face, the way her hands trembled as she poured more of herself into the spell.\n\"You're pushing too hard,\" Sophia called, stepping closer despite the heat of the magic.\n\"Stay back!\" Arin snapped, her voice laced with both power and tiredness. \"I'm fine.\"\nBut she wasn't great. Sophia could see it in the way Arin's shoulders slumped, the way her aura flickered unevenly. The spell was taking everything from her.\n\"Arin, stop!\" Sophia shouted. \"You're going to kill yourself!\"\n\"Better me than all of Aquaria,\" Arin said through hard teeth.\nThe runes flared one last time, a blinding rush of energy pulsing outward. Sophia was thrown back, the force knocking the air from her lungs. When the light faded, the walls glowed steady and strong once more. But Arin fell to her knees, her aura dimmed to almost nothing.\nSophia was at her side in an instant, stopping her before she could fall further. Arin's skin was cold, her breaths shallow.\n\"Arin,\" Sophia said urgently, shaking her softly. \"Stay with me.\"\nArin's eyes fluttered open, her look unfocused. \"Did it work?\" she muttered.\nSophia nodded, her voice thick with emotion. \"You did it. The walls are holding.\"\nA faint smile crossed Arin's lips before her eyes closed again. Sophia's heart squeezed as she turned to Tharros and Kael, who had rushed to join them.\n\"She needs help,\" Sophia said, her voice steady despite the fear eating at her. \"We have to get her to the healers. Now.\"\nTharros nodded, lifting Arin's limp form with surprising care. \"She'll get the best care we can give her.\"\nKael's face was grim as he followed. \"She's stronger than anyone gives her credit for. She'll pull through.\"\nSophia trailed behind, her mind racing. Arin had risked everything to protect Aquaria. It wasn't just magic that had kept the barriers intact-it was her unwavering drive.\nHours later, Sophia sat by Arin's bedside in the healer's room. The steady hum of healing spells filled the air, their light casting a calming glow. Arin's breathing was even, but she hadn't woken.\n\"You didn't have to do this alone,\" Sophia whispered, her fingers brushing Arin's cool hand. \"We're supposed to be a team.\"\nThe door opened softly, and Tharros stepped inside. He put a hand on Sophia's shoulder, his expression both grateful and weary.\n\"She'll recover,\" he said quietly. \"Thanks to you.\"\nSophia shook her head. \"Thanks to her. She's the reason we're still here.\"\nTharros' gaze softened. \"You're both the reason Aquaria has hope.\"\nSophia met his eyes, determination burning in her chest. \"Then we'll make sure her sacrifice wasn't in vain. We'll finish what she started.\"\nAs Tharros nodded, a faint sound drew their attention. Arin's lips moved, her words barely audible.\n\"Don't screw it up,\" she murmured, a ghost of her normal sarcasm slipping through.\nSophia laughed softly, tears prickling her eyes. \"We won't.\"\nBut as she sat back, the shadow of the Leviathan stayed in her thoughts. The fight was far from over, and sacrifices would continue to be made. Sophia could only hope they'd be enough.\nShadows in the Palace\nThe quiet of the royal night was misleading. The bright towers of Aquaria shone gently in the dark, creating soft shapes on the coral walls. Even though there was a delicate peace after Arin's sacrifice, Sophia still felt a knot of worry in her chest. There was a problem.\nHer steps were silent as she moved through the halls, her thoughts circling the events of the past days. The walls stayed strong, but you could feel the stress on everyone. Arin was still recovering, but she was getting weaker. Kael and Tharros had thrown themselves into bolstering defenses, their loads heavier than ever. Sophia felt a heavy burden on her shoulders.\nSophia felt a strange disturbance in the air, like a soft hum of magic that suddenly faded. She stopped suddenly, automatically reaching for the knife she had begun carrying since the attacks by the Leviathan became more frequent. The quiet stretched, thick and unnatural, before a faint scuffle broke it.\nSophia turned to see what was making the noise, her heart beating fast.\nKael's spear shone under the soft glow of the palace's magical lights as he patrolled the northern wing. He'd insisted on taking extra shifts, a combination of duty and a need to clear his thoughts. His thoughts often drifted to his recent revelation about his royal lineage, the weight of it settling heavily on him. But tonight, his instincts were on high alert.\nThe smallest whisper of movement caught his attention. He turned sharply, his grip stiffening on the spear.\n\"Who's there?\" his voice rang out, low but authoritative.\nNo answer. Kael's jaw tightened as he moved down the hall, his steps cautious. The shadows seemed to move, the tiniest flicker of something just beyond his sight. He moved quickly, rounding the corner just in time to see a figure slip through a hidden passage.\nKael's eyes narrowed. \"Intruder,\" he mumbled, and gave chase.\nSophia reached the atrium just as Kael emerged from the tunnel, his spear raised. His eyes locked on her, his expression sharp.\n\"There's someone in the palace,\" he said without introduction.\nSophia nodded, her own suspicions verified. \"I felt it too. Where?\"\nKael indicated behind him. \"They're fast. Headed toward the lower chambers.\"\nSophia didn't pause. \"Let's go.\"\nThe two moved in unison, their attention singular. As they dropped into the deeper levels of the palace, the air grew colder, the shadows thicker. The faint glow of the coral walls seemed weaker here, as if the light itself was retreating.\nTharros stood in the war room, pouring over defense plans when the alarm spell he'd set flickered to life. A burst of golden light erupted from the map, marking an intruder breach. His golden eyes narrowed, his aura flaring as he strode toward the noise.\nThe king moved with purpose, his draconic instincts sharpening his senses. He followed the magical trail, his energy pulsing in warning. As he turned a corner, he collided with Sophia and Kael.\n\"An intruder,\" Sophia said quickly, her tone urgent.\n\"They're heading for the archives,\" Kael added, his grip firm on his spear.\nTharros' eyes darkened. \"Then they're after something important.\"\nTogether, the three moved toward the archives, their pace quick but quiet. The palace's lower chambers were a labyrinth of ancient passageways, the air thick with the weight of history. It was here that Aquaria's most valuable secrets were stored, including artifacts tied to the Leviathan.\nThe intruder was skilled, slipping through the dark like a phantom. But as they reached the archive entrance, they found their way blocked. Sophia stood at the middle, her dagger glinting faintly in the dim light. To her left, Kael's spear was set, ready to strike. To her right, Tharros projected an aura of raw power, his golden light illuminating the hall.\nThe figure paused, their hooded form flickering with a faint, dark energy.\n\"You're not going anywhere,\" Tharros said, his voice a low growl.\nThe intruder didn't reply. Instead, they raised a hand, releasing a burst of shadowy power that sent the group scattering. Sophia ducked, rolling to the side as Kael deflected the blow with his spear. Tharros lunged forward, his aura flaring as he closed the gap.\nThe intruder moved with inhuman speed, avoiding Tharros' strike and countering with another wave of magic. But Sophia saw their mistake-they were too focused on striking. With a swift move, she surged forward, her dagger slicing through the shadows that cloaked them.\nThe figure staggered, their hood falling back to show a face marked with glowing, corrupted veins. Sophia's breath caught.\n\"They're connected to the Leviathan,\" she whispered.\nThe intruder snarled, their voice twisted. \"You cannot stop what is coming.\"\nKael struck next, his spear slicing through their shields. The invader fell to their knees, their energy flickering like a dying flame. Tharros stepped forward, his golden aura pulsing ominously.\n\"Who sent you?\" he asked.\nThe figure smirked, their corrupted veins shining brighter. \"You'll find out soon enough.\"\nBefore anyone could respond, the intruder's body disintegrated into a cloud of dark mist, dissipating into the air. The room fell silent, the weight of their words remaining.\nIn the wake, the group reconvened in the war room. The tension was thick, each of them grappling with the meanings of what had just occurred.\n\"The Leviathan has spies in the palace,\" Kael said, his tone grim. \"We can't trust anyone.\"\n\"We need to strengthen the wards,\" Tharros added. \"No one gets in or out without scrutiny.\"\nSophia nodded, her mind whirling. \"This isn't just about defense. They were after something. We need to find out what.\"\nArin's voice, faint but constant, cut through the room. \"The Leviathan doesn't send agents without purpose. Whatever they were after, it's tied to their endgame.\"\nAll eyes turned to the sea witch, who leaned heavily on the doorway, her pallor still pale from her experience.\n\"You should be resting,\" Sophia said gently.\nArin smirked slightly. \"Rest can wait. Right now, we have bigger problems.\"\nAs the group delved into the archives, the tension between them eased slightly, their common focus strengthening their bond. But the unease remained. The Leviathan's influence was growing, its reach reaching even into the heart of Aquaria. They couldn't afford any more mistakes.\nSophia's gaze lingered on the ancient scrolls they discovered, her heart heavy with determination.\n\"We'll find a way to stop it,\" she said quietly, more to herself than anyone else.\nTharros stepped beside her, his golden eyes steady. \"We will. Together.\"\nBut as the shadows in the palace deepened, a new question arose: How far would the Leviathan go to destroy them from within? And were they truly prepared for what was coming?\nThe Abyss Beckons\nSophia couldn't explain the pull. It started as a whisper in the back of her mind, soft but forceful. As the hours passed, the whisper became a roar, an unrelenting tide dragging her thoughts to the ditch. She tried to push it away, to focus on the immediate threats within Aquaria. But the force wouldn't stop.\nBy the time the others noticed her distraction, the choice was already made. She needs to go.\n\"You've been quiet,\" Kael said, his tone wary as he caught up to her in the hallways. His sharp eyes scanned her face, looking for answers she wasn't ready to give.\nSophia paused, her hands brushing against the walls as if grounding herself. \"There's something calling me. I don't know what it is, but I have to find out.\"\nKael's frown worsened. \"The trench? That's madness. You know how dangerous it is down there.\"\n\"I know,\" Sophia responded, her voice firm. \"But it's not a choice. It feels like something is pulling me. Like I'm going to go.\"\nTharros' golden aura flickered as he neared, having overheard. \"If you're going to the abyss, you won't go alone. None of us are leaving you to face it by yourself.\"\nSophia opened her mouth to argue, but the determination in Tharros' eyes silenced her. She nodded, thanks mixing with the unease that churned in her chest.\nThe trip to the trench was somber. Arin, still weak from her offering, insisted on coming despite her pallor. Kael gripped his spear tighter than normal, his silence speaking volumes. Tharros swam ahead, his presence a beacon of power as they descended into the depths.\nSophia felt the pressure of the ocean increase, the water getting colder and darker. The oncevivid colors of Aquaria faded into a haunting, murky landscape. The trench loomed before them, its jagged edges pulsating softly with an eerie glow.\n\"This place is alive,\" Kael whispered, his voice tense.\nArin's power flared briefly, a soft light illuminating the walls. \"Alive and old,\" she said. \"There's power here. Ancient power.\"\nSophia shivered, the pull getting stronger with every stroke of her fins. \"It's close,\" she said, her voice faraway.\nTharros glanced back at her. \"What is?\"\n\"I don't know,\" Sophia revealed. \"But it's waiting for us.\"\nThe trench opened into a vast chamber, the walls lined with crystalline formations that pulsed slightly with light. In the center, a massive structure rose from the seabed, its form both alien and familiar. Sophia's breath caught as she recognized the detailed carvings that adorned its surface.\n\"This is\" she trailed off, her fingers brushing against the patterns.\nArin's eyes widened as she joined Sophia. \"A temple,\" she said softly. \"Built long before Aquaria existed.\"\nKael's grip on his spear tightened. \"What kind of temple?\"\nArin's voice was gloomy. \"One dedicated to the Leviathan.\"\nThe group explored the temple carefully, their movements careful as they navigated its labyrinthine halls. Symbols etched into the walls seemed to pulse with a faint, rhythmic energy, their patterns twisting and shifting as if living.\nSophia felt the pull increase as they reached the heart of the temple. A huge chamber stretched out before them, dominated by a glowing orb suspended in the center. The orb's light covered the room in a pale, otherworldly glow.\n\"That's it,\" Sophia whispered, her voice tinged with awe and fear.\nTharros stepped forward, his energy brightening. \"What is it?\"\nArin's voice was shaky as she studied the orb. \"A fragment of the Leviathan's power. Sealed here long ago.\"\nKael's face darkened. \"If this is a piece of its power, why does it feel like it's still connected to the creature?\"\nArin's eyes flicked to Sophia. \"Because it is. And it's calling to her.\"\nSophia stepped closer to the orb, her heart racing. The pull was powerful now, a tide that threatened to sweep her away. She reached out, her fingers inches from the glowing surface when Tharros' voice stopped her.",

        "content": "\"Wait,\" he said, his tone stern. \"We don't know what touching it will do.\"\nSophia paused, the pull warring with Tharros' warning. \"It's not just calling to me,\" she said, her voice shaking. \"It's showing me something. A way to stop the Leviathan.\"\nKael stepped beside her, his protective instincts rising. \"And what if it's a trap?\"\nSophia turned to him, her eyes bright with purpose. \"Then we have to take that risk. If we do nothing, the Leviathan will destroy everything.\"\nTharros put a hand on her shoulder, his golden eyes steady. \"If you're sure, we'll stand with you.\"\nSophia's fingers brushed the ball, and the world around her shifted. She was no longer in the temple but standing in a vast expanse of light and darkness. In the distance, the Leviathan's huge form writhed, its presence a suffocating weight.\nA voice, old and resonant, echoed through the void. \"The Leviathan was born of chaos, a force meant to balance creation. But its aim has twisted, its power corrupted.\"\nSophia turned, looking for the source of the voice. \"How do we stop it?\"\n\"Balance must be restored,\" the voice answered. \"The bridge must unite what was divided. Only then can the Leviathan be sealed.\"\nThe vision faded, and Sophia found herself back in the room, her body trembling. The orb's light dimmed, its energy spent.\n\"What did you see?\" Tharros asked, his words urgent.\nSophia's gaze met his, her resolution unshaken. \"A way to stop the Leviathan. But it's going to take all of us.\"\nAs they left the temple, the weight of their finding pressed heavily on the group. The Leviathan's origins were more complex than they had thought, its power rooted in a balance that had long been broken.\nSophia's thoughts churned as they climbed from the trench. The road ahead was fraught with danger, but for the first time, she felt a glimmer of hope. They had a way forward. Now, they just had to live long enough to see it through.\nAs the shadows of the abyss faded, the faint glow of Aquaria came into view. But the Leviathan's roar echoed in the distance, a chilling reminder that their fight was far from over.\nPreparing for Unity\nThe trench's haunting echoes still remained in Sophia's mind as they returned to Aquaria. The temple's revelations had been as enlightening as they were startling. The Leviathan was not merely a force of destruction; it was chaos personified, tied to the balance of their world. And now, with its bonds weakening, their only chance lay in forging a unity that had never been attempted before.\nSophia stood in the center room of the palace, surrounded by glowing diagrams and intricate schematics. The air buzzed with anxiety and the faint hum of magical wards. Beside her, Kael and Tharros studied the blueprints of a device that would combine Aquarian magic with surface technology-a tool meant to amplify her unique powers as the bridge between two worlds.\n\"This might actually work,\" Kael said, his voice tinged with cautious hope.\nTharros, ever the realist, crossed his arms. \"It has to work. We don't have another option.\"\nSophia exhaled, her eyes fixed on the glowing projections. \"Then we make it work. But it's going to take all of us.\"\nThe construction of the device started immediately. Sophia divided the tasks, ensuring that everyone's skills were utilized. Kael watched the physical assembly, his warrior instincts translating into exact craftsmanship. Tharros focused on stabilizing the magical components, his draconic energy giving the foundation for the device's power. Arin, though still recovering, lent her skill in weaving spells into the design.\nAs the hours turned into days, the house buzzed with activity. However, the strain of their mission started to show. Old grudges simmered beneath the surface, threatening to boil over.\n\"You're doing it wrong,\" Arin snapped, her tone sharper than normal as she watched Kael attach a glowing conduit to the device.\nKael's eyes narrowed. \"If you think you can do better, feel free to take over.\"\nArin's dark aura flared briefly, a sign of her remaining fatigue. \"I would, if you'd stop pretending you know everything.\"\nKael stepped back, his grip on his spear stiffening. \"I'm trying to help, Arin. Maybe instead of attacking, you could offer something constructive.\"\nBefore the argument could escalate, Sophia stepped between them, her words calm but firm. \"Enough. We don't have time for this.\"\nBoth Kael and Arin glared at each other before looking away, their tension temporarily diffused by Sophia's presence.\n\"We're all tired,\" Sophia continued, her eyes sweeping over them. \"But we're stronger together. If we let old grudges confuse us, the Leviathan wins.\"\nArin sighed, her aura shrinking. \"You're right. I'm sorry.\"\nKael nodded reluctantly. \"Let's just get this done.\"\nThe device began to take shape, its crystalline core glowing with a soft, steady pulse. Tharros infused the building with his energy, his golden aura weaving through the conduits like living light. Sophia watched in awe as the magic and technology merged effortlessly, their synergy a testament to what could be achieved through unity.\n\"It's beautiful,\" she whispered, her voice filled with quiet wonder.\nTharros glanced at her, a faint smile easing his usually stern features. \"Beautiful isn't enough. It needs to be unstoppable.\"\nSophia met his eyes, determination hardening her expression. \"It will be.\"\nAs the final pieces were assembled, the tension in the air grew noticeable. Sophia's mind raced with doubts she couldn't speak. The Leviathan was more than a monster; it was a force of nature. Could their work truly stand against it?\nThat night, as the others rested, Sophia found herself in the observation room, staring out at the glowing expanse of Aquaria. The city's light mirrored in her eyes, a reminder of what was at stake.\n\"Can't sleep?\" Tharros' voice broke the quiet.\nSophia turned to find him standing in the doorway, his golden eyes filled with understanding.\n\"Too much on my mind,\" she revealed.\nTharros stepped closer, his presence stabilizing. \"You're carrying a lot. But you're not alone in this.\"\nSophia achieved a faint smile. \"I know. But sometimes it feels like everything depends on me.\"\nTharros put a hand on her shoulder, his touch warm and reassuring. \"It doesn't. We're in this together, Sophia. Whatever happens, we face it as one.\"\nHer smile grew stronger, the weight on her chest lifting slightly. \"Thank you, Tharros.\"\nThe next day, the group met in the central chamber to test the device. The tension was thick as Sophia stepped forward, her heart racing. She put her hands on the crystalline core, its surface cool beneath her fingers.\n\"Ready?\" Tharros asked, his voice steady.\nSophia nodded. \"Let's do this.\"\nAs the device activated, a surge of energy coursed through her, filling her with a strength unlike anything she'd ever felt. The room lit up with a brilliant glow, the magic and technology harmonizing in a dazzling show. For a moment, it felt as though the entire city was holding its breath.\nBut then, the glow flickered. The energy trembled, unstable. Sophia gasped as the power threatened to spin out of control.\n\"Something's wrong,\" Arin said, her voice laced with fear.\nKael stepped forward. \"What do we do?\"\n\"Focus,\" Tharros ordered, his aura flaring as he channeled his energy into the device. \"Sophia, you can stabilize it. Trust yourself.\"\nSophia closed her eyes, her breath steadying as she reached deep within herself. She felt the connection between the magic and science, the delicate balance that held it together. With careful precision, she directed the energy, smoothing the chaotic surges until the glow became steady once more.\nWhen she opened her eyes, the gadget pulsed with a rhythmic light, its power contained and ready.\n\"You did it,\" Kael said, his voice filled with awe.\nSophia stepped back, her legs trembling but her determination stronger than ever. \"We did it. Together.\"\nAs they stood before the completed device, a feeling of accomplishment filled the room. But the win was tempered by the knowledge of what lay ahead. The Leviathan would not wait, and their creation would soon be put to the ultimate test.\nSophia looked at her friends, the weight of their trip reflected in their faces.\n\"This is just the beginning,\" she said softly.\nTharros nodded, his eyes steady. \"Then we'd better be ready.\"\nBut as they prepared for the fight to come, the faintest tremor ran through the palace, a chilling reminder that their enemy was closer than ever.\nThe Leviathan Strikes\nAquaria's waters darkened as the Leviathan neared. The glowing towers that once stood as symbols of safety now flickered, their light faltering against the growing shadow. The tension in the city was palpable, a collective breath held in fear and expectation. And then, the quiet broke.\nThe Leviathan's roar tore through the depths, a sound so deep it seemed to shake the very roots of the ocean. The first wave of its assault came quickly, a horde of corrupted sea creatures charging toward the city's barriers. From the observation room, Sophia stood, her fists clenched, her heart pounding with equal parts fear and determination.\n\"It's begun,\" Tharros said, his golden aura flashing as he turned to face the others. \"We hold the line. No matter what.\"\nSophia nodded, her eyes steady. \"Let's show it what we're made of.\"\nThe city's defenses roared to life, barriers glowing as they repelled the first wave of attacks. Arin stood at the head of the magical battlements, her dark energy weaving complex spells that struck down swarms of corrupted creatures. Her movements were precise, but the strain on her face was obvious.\n\"You're pushing too hard,\" Kael said, his spear slicing through a serpentlike monstrosity as he moved to cover her side.\nArin smiled, though her breath came in short gasps. \"You've been saying that since we started. Still here, aren't I?\"\nKael rolled his eyes but didn't argue. Instead, he thrust his weapon forward, impaling another thing that lunged for the barrier. \"Just don't make me carry you out of here.\"\n\"Deal,\" Arin replied, her aura flaring as she fired a wave of dark energy that obliterated the next wave of attackers.\nSophia stood at the command center, her hybrid powers humming beneath her skin as she organized the defense. The device they had built pulsed beside her, its crystalline core amplifying her link to both Aquarian magic and surface technology. Every time she reached for the energy, it responded, guiding her movements with a clarity she hadn't felt before.\n\"Reinforce the eastern wall,\" she directed, her voice steady despite the chaos. \"The Leviathan is focusing its attacks there.\"\nTharros' golden energy flared as he communicated her orders, his presence a constant source of reassurance. \"The barriers won't hold forever,\" he said, his tone grim.\n\"They don't have to,\" Sophia answered. \"We just need to buy time.\"\nTharros nodded, his eyes meeting hers. \"Then let's make every second count.\"\nThe Leviathan's huge form emerged from the darkness, its sheer size dwarfing the city. Its eyes burned with a malevolent light, and its tentacles lashed out, hitting the barriers with devastating force. The ground trembled with each hit, cracks spreading through the shimmering shields.\nSophia's heart sank as she watched. The Leviathan's power was overwhelming, its presence smothering. But she refused to fall.\n\"We need to weaken it,\" she said, her voice strong. \"Arin, can you disrupt its energy?\"\nArin's eyes narrowed as she studied the creature. \"I can try, but I'll need time.\"\n\"Kael, cover her,\" Sophia demanded. \"Tharros and I will draw its attention.\"\nKael nodded, moving to Arin's side as she started weaving a complex spell. Sophia and Tharros shared a glance, unspoken understanding passing between them.\n\"Ready?\" she asked.\nTharros smirked, his aura burning. \"Always.\"\nThe two charged toward the Leviathan, their combined energy cutting through the swarm of corrupted creatures that circled it. Sophia's hybrid powers surged, a blend of magic and technology that made dazzling bursts of light. Tharros' golden flames roared, his draconic power unmatched as he tore through the Leviathan's defenses.\nThe creature's attention moved to them, its massive eyes locking onto Sophia. A tentacle lashed out, aiming straight for her. She dodged, her heart racing as the contact sent a shockwave through the water.\n\"Over here!\" Tharros roared, drawing its attention away. His aura flared brighter as he released a torrent of energy that struck the Leviathan's side. The creature roared in pain, its movements briefly faltering.\nMeanwhile, Kael stood guard as Arin chanted, her evil energy coalescing into a swirling vortex. The spell needed immense focus, and her breathing grew labored as she worked. Kael's spear struck down any creature that came too close, his moves precise and unyielding.\n\"How much longer?\" he asked, looking back at her.\n\"Almost there,\" Arin answered, her voice strained. \"Just keep them off me.\"\nKael nodded, his resolve firm. He planted himself firmly, his spear shining as he prepared for the next wave.\nSophia and Tharros continued their attack, their combined efforts chipping away at the Leviathan's defenses. But the creature's power was persistent. A sudden rush of energy knocked them back, the impact leaving Sophia disoriented.\n\"Sophia!\" Tharros shouted, stopping her before she could fall.\n\"I'm okay,\" she said, her voice shaky. She steadied herself, her purpose unshaken. \"We have to keep going.\"\nTharros nodded, his golden eyes fierce. \"Then let's end this.\"\nArin's spell reached its peak, a surge of dark energy erupting from her hands and hitting the Leviathan. The thing writhed, its movements slowing as the disruption took hold. Kael moved quickly, his spear finding its mark as he struck one of the Leviathan's vulnerable points.\n\"Now, Sophia!\" Arin shouted, her voice booming through the chaos.\nSophia focused all her energy, the device amplifying her power as she fired a final, blinding attack. The light pierced through the Leviathan, its roar of pain shaking the ocean. The creature retired, its form dissolving into the darkness.\nThe battlefield fell silent, the corrupted creatures disappearing as the Leviathan's presence faded. Sophia fell to her knees, her body trembling with exhaustion. Tharros was at her side in an instant, his hand steadying her.\n\"You did it,\" he said, his voice soft but filled with joy.\nSophia shook her head. \"We did it.\"\nArin and Kael neared, both battered but alive. Arin's smirk returned, though her eyes were heavy with tiredness. \"Not bad for a bunch of misfits.\"\nKael chuckled, his grip on his spear relaxing. \"Let's hope it stays gone.\"\nBut as the group looked out over the quieted waters, a faint tremor moved through the ocean. The Leviathan's roar echoed once more, distant but clear.\nSophia's heart sank. \"It's not over.\"\nTharros' jaw tightened, his golden aura flaring anew. \"Then we'll be ready.\"\nEchoes of the Deep\nThe distant roar of the Leviathan faded into the deep, leaving behind an unsettling quiet. Aquaria's glowing towers sparked back to life, casting gentle blue light across the damaged city. Sophia stood with her friends, their bodies weary but emotions unbroken.\n\"We need to regroup,\" she said, running a hand through her hair. Her skin still hummed with power, the hybrid energy that had coursed through her during the fight now settling into a gentle pulse. \"That thing is still out there.\"\nTharros nodded, his golden glow dim but steady. \"The eastern defense rooms remain intact. We can gather there.\"\nAs they moved through the city, citizens appeared from shelters, their faces showing a mix of relief and fear. Children pointed at Sophia and her friends, whispering of the heroes who had driven back the darkness. But Sophia felt no triumph-only an increasing unease.\nThe defense room buzzed with activity. Healers tended to the wounded while planners huddled around glowing maps of the ocean floor. Arin slumped into a chair, her dark energy sparking weakly around her fingers.\n\"Don't give me that look,\" she said when Kael approached with worry etched on his face. \"I told you I'd still be standing when this was over.\"\n\"Barely,\" he replied, but there was no judgment in his words. He set his stick against the wall and took the seat beside her. \"That spell you cast-I've never seen anything like it.\"\nArin's lips curled into a tired smile. \"Ancient method. Costs more than it's worth, usually.\"\n\"But it worked,\" Sophia said, joining them at the table. \"You disrupted its energy long enough for us to strike.\"\nTharros stayed standing, his gaze fixed on the maps. \"Not long enough. The monster retreats, but it lives. And now it knows our skills.\"\nThe room fell silent as the weight of his words settled over them. Their victory had been temporary-a pause in a fight that was far from over.\nThe Whale Song Seers arrived as the first watch changed. Three elders glided into the room, their skin glowing with patterns that shifted like live constellations. The biggest one, Matriarch Lyra, bowed her head to Tharros.\n\"The ocean speaks of your bravery today,\" she said, her voice flowing through the water like a current. \"But it also whispers warnings.\"\n\"Tell us,\" Sophia urged, stepping forward. The device they had built hummed at her side, reacting to the Seers' presence.\nLyra closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, they glowed with inner light. \"The beast that hunts you is no mere thing. It is the ocean's memory of pain, born from old wounds when sea and shore were torn apart.\"\n\"We know what it is,\" Kael said impatiently. \"What we don't know is how to stop it permanently.\"\nMatriarch Lyra turned to him, her eyes softening. \"The four waters must become one tide. Divided, you will fall before its might. United...\" She paused, and for a moment, her calm faltered. \"United, there must be sacrifice.\"\nSophia felt a chill run through her. \"What kind of sacrifice?\"\nBut the Seer would not explain. Instead, the three adults began to sing, their voices weaving a melody that made the water vibrate. Images formed in the center of the room-the Leviathan, the deep pit from which it had emerged, and four lights that swirled together to form a barrier against the darkness.\n\"The bond that binds you is your strength,\" Lyra said as the song finished. \"But it is also the key the darkness seeks. To close the door, one light must cross the threshold.\"\nThe Seers departed as mysteriously as they had come, leaving confusion in their wake.\n\"Riddles and songs,\" Arin mumbled, once they were alone again. \"Why can't they just tell us what to do?\"\nTharros paced the room, his tail lashing behind him. \"The Seers speak in metaphor because the truth is too terrible to voice directly.\"\n\"One light must cross the threshold,\" Sophia repeated, her thoughts racing. \"They're talking about one of us dying.\"\nThe room grew still. Kael's grip tightened on his stick. \"No. There has to be another way.\"\nSophia moved to the device they had built, studying its crystalline core. \"The Leviathan feeds on our divide. On our fear.\" She looked up at her friends. \"I don't think the price is death. I think it's something else.\"\n\"What then?\" Arin asked, leaning forward.\nBefore Sophia could answer, an alarm blared through the room. A guard burst in, fear clear on her face.\n\"The eastern trenches,\" she gasped. \"Something's moving.\"\nThey gathered at the viewing deck, watching as sensors tracked movement in the deep. The Leviathan wasn't attacking-not yet. It was circling, its massive form disturbing ancient sediment and showing something buried beneath.\n\"What is it doing?\" Kael asked, his voice tight with stress.\nTharros' eyes narrowed. \"It's searching.\"\nSophia felt a pull toward the trenches, an unexplainable link that made her heart race. \"There's something down there. Something connected to us.\"\nArin put a hand on the glass, her eyes reflecting the dark depths. \"The vision mentioned a key. What if it's not metaphorical?\"\nSophia's mind clicked pieces into place-the device, the energy patterns, the Seers' words. \"The four waters becoming one tide,\" she whispered. \"Our powers together created something new during the battle.\"\n\"But it wasn't enough,\" Tharros added, his golden eyes meeting hers.\n\"Because we're still holding back,\" Sophia realized. \"We've combined our strengths, but we haven't truly united.\" She turned to face her friends, determination growing. \"The sacrifice isn't death-it's uniqueness. To destroy the Leviathan, one of us must give up their separate identity and become the conduit for all our powers.\"\nThe meanings hung heavy in the water between them. Such a merging might be permanent-the person lost within the combined force.\n\"I'll do it,\" all four said in agreement, then looked at each other in surprise.\nA tremor shook the viewing deck, and the lights flickered once more. In the distance, the Leviathan's roar echoed through the deep, closer this time, more determined.\n\"We don't have much time,\" Sophia said, her gaze moving between her friends. \"We need to decide.\"\nTharros stepped forward, his energy brightening. \"As king, it is my duty-\"\n\"As a warrior, it should be me,\" Kael interrupted.\n\"My dark energy makes me the logical choice,\" Arin argued.\nBut Sophia knew in her heart what must be done. \"It has to be me,\" she said quietly. \"I'm the bridge between worlds already-human and Aquarian, science and magic.\"\nBefore they could argue further, the chamber shook violently. Cracks spread across the reinforced glass of the viewing window. The Leviathan had found what it was looking for, and now it was coming-not just for the city, but for them.\n\"We need to prepare,\" Sophia said, her voice steady despite the fear squeezing her heart. She reached out, taking the hands of her friends. \"Whatever happens next, we face it together.\"\nAs they hurried from the chamber, Sophia looked back at the deepening darkness beyond the glass. The answer was down there, hidden in the trenches-a truth older than Aquaria itself. And somehow, she knew their story was about to change forever.\nThe Leviathan's distant roar got louder, calling to something deep within her soul. The final battle was coming, and with it, a decision that would echo through the depths for generations.\nThe Decision\nThe council chamber buzzed with angry voices. Twelve Aquarian elders sat in a halfcircle, their faces lit by the glowing coral that lined the walls. At the center stood Sophia, Tharros, Kael, and Arin.\n\"Absolutely not!\" shouted Elder Maris, slamming his webbed hand on the table. \"The Abyssal Trenches are forbidden for a reason!\"\nSophia stepped forward, her heart pounding. Just hours ago, they had driven back the Leviathan, but its distant roar still echoed in her mind. \"The Whale Song Seers were clear. The answer lies in the deep.\"\n\"The Seers speak in riddles,\" countered a female elder with silvery scales. \"They did not directly tell you to risk your lives in the most dangerous part of our realm.\"\nTharros stood tall, his golden aura casting shadows across the chamber. \"In all my centuries, I have never suggested breaking our most sacred laws. But we cannot defeat the Leviathan with halfmeasures.\"\nSophia felt a strange tug in her chest as he mentioned the trenches. It was like an invisible string pulling her downward, calling her to the darkness below. She'd felt it ever since the battle ended.\n\"Something's down there,\" she whispered, then louder: \"Something's waiting for us.\"\nThe elders exchanged worried glances.\nKael stepped beside Sophia, his spear tapping the floor with quiet determination. \"We've all felt it. The Leviathan emerged from the trenches. If we want to stop it for good, we need to understand where it came from.\"\n\"And what created it,\" added Arin, her dark energy swirling around her fingers. The battle had drained her, but her eyes were sharp with curiosity. \"No evil that powerful forms without reason.\"\nElder Maris shook his head. \"The trenches have claimed countless explorers. None return the same, if they return at all.\"\n\"We're not ordinary explorers,\" Tharros replied.\nFor three hours, the debate raged. The elders quoted ancient warnings. Sophia described the pull she felt toward the depths. Kael outlined tactical approaches. Arin suggested magical protections.\nFinally, the eldest member of the council, a woman whose face was lined with so many wrinkles she resembled ancient coral, raised her hand for silence.\n\"You will not go with our blessing,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"But we cannot stop you.\"\nDawn found them in Tharros' private chambers, gathered around a large table covered with maps of Aquaria.\n\"The problem,\" Tharros said, running a clawed finger along the eastern edge of the maps, \"is that our charts end here. The trenches are largely unmapped.\"\nSophia couldn't take her eyes off the empty space on the map, the vast unknown area marked simply as 'The Abyss.' The pulling sensation in her chest grew stronger as she stared at it.\n\"We need to prepare thoroughly,\" Tharros continued. \"The pressure down there would crush ordinary beings. Even I must be cautious.\"\nKael nodded, his expression grim. \"Sophia will need training. Her transformation has given her abilities, but deepsea survival is something else entirely.\"\n\"I can help,\" Arin said, surprising them all. She rarely volunteered assistance. \"There are ancient texts in my tower. Accounts of the few who ventured into the trenches and lived to write about it.\"\nSophia looked up at her friends, a lump forming in her throat. They were willing to risk everything to follow her instinct, her unexplainable connection to the depths.\n\"Thank you,\" she said simply.\nThe next three days passed in a blur of preparation. Each morning, Kael took Sophia to a training chamber deep beneath the palace.\n\"The key,\" he explained as they swam through increasingly pressurized water, \"is not fighting the pressure, but becoming one with it.\"\nSophia's muscles ached as she practiced new swimming techniques, learned to regulate her breathing through her newly formed gills, and mastered the art of moving efficiently in crushing depths.\nKael proved a demanding teacher. \"Again,\" he would say whenever she faltered. But his eyes showed pride when she mastered a particularly difficult maneuver.\n\"You're learning faster than anyone I've ever trained,\" he admitted on the third day, as she successfully navigated a pitchblack obstacle course using only her developing hydrokinetic senses.",

        "content": "\"I have a good reason to learn,\" she replied, thinking of the Leviathan's roar and the safety of Aquaria.\nNights found her with Arin in the sea witch's coral tower, poring over ancient scrolls and tablets.\n\"Most of these are warnings,\" Arin said, pushing aside a crumbling text. \"Beware the darkness, fear the pressure, flee from the voices...\" She rolled her eyes. \"Helpful.\"\nBut as the midnight currents flowed past the tower's windows, they discovered accounts of strange creatures, mysterious structures, and powerful magic hidden in the trenches.\n\"Listen to this,\" Sophia said, carefully unrolling a fragile scroll. \"'The abyss is not empty but remembers what the surface has forgotten.'\"\nArin leaned closer, her eyes widening. \"That matches what the Whale Song Seers told us.\"\nTogether they compiled notes, mapping out possible dangers and potential discoveries. Despite her exhaustion, Sophia felt more alive than ever. This was what she had trained for as a scientist - exploring the unknown.\nOn the fourth day, Tharros summoned them to his private vault beneath the palace. The massive door opened at his touch, revealing a chamber filled with treasures from his centuries of rule.\n\"I've lived a long time,\" he said, leading them past shelves of artifacts. \"Collected many things.\"\nAt the back of the vault, he unlocked a smaller door and withdrew a cylindrical case. His hands treated it with unusual gentleness.\n\"I'd forgotten about this until now,\" he said, placing it on a table. \"It came to me centuries ago, brought by a dying explorer.\"\nHe opened the case. Inside lay a rolled parchment, its edges blackened as if burned. With careful claws, Tharros spread it on the table.\nSophia gasped. It was a map of the Abyssal Trenches - detailed, intricate, showing pathways, caverns, and structures that shouldn't exist in such depths.\n\"The explorer said he found it embedded in crystal near the trench edge,\" Tharros explained. \"He was the sole survivor of his expedition. His last words were 'It waits below.'\"\nKael leaned over the map, his brow furrowed. \"These passages don't match any modern charts.\"\n\"Because no modern explorer has gone so deep and returned,\" Arin whispered.\nSophia traced a path with her finger, following a route that wound down into the darkest part of the trench. At the bottom, a symbol was drawn - a spiral surrounded by four smaller circles.\nThe tugging in her chest became almost painful as she touched the symbol. Suddenly, the map began to glow, faint lines of blue light spreading from where her finger had touched.\n\"What's happening?\" Kael asked, reaching for his spear.\nTharros shook his head, golden eyes wide with wonder. \"In all these years, it never did that.\"\nThe glowing lines formed new paths on the map, routes that hadn't been visible before. And at the very bottom of the trench, where the spiral symbol had been, a new marking appeared - a shape that looked remarkably like the device Sophia had built, the one that had amplified her powers during the battle.\n\"It's responding to you,\" Arin said, her voice hushed. \"As if it was waiting.\"\nThe four friends looked at each other. The decision they had been debating was suddenly clear.\n\"We leave tomorrow,\" Tharros declared.\nAs Sophia stared at the glowing map, the strange pull in her chest felt like a promise. Something ancient waited in the darkness below - something connected to her, to all of them.\nAnd to the Leviathan that still haunted the deep.\nInto the Deep\nThe morning sky turned pink as Sophia stared at the glowing map. Her friends stood close, each lost in their own thoughts. Tomorrow they would journey to a place where no one returned from.\n\"We need supplies,\" Tharros said, breaking the silence. \"Special gear for the pressure.\"\nKael nodded. \"I'll visit the armory. We'll need weapons that work in the dark.\"\n\"And I'll gather magical protections,\" Arin added, her eyes gleaming with determination.\nThey split up, each with a mission. Sophia clutched the map to her chest, the pull inside her growing stronger by the hour.\nThe royal storage halls buzzed with activity. Guards and servants rushed about, gathering rare crystals, pressure suits, and special breathing devices. King Tharros stood tall, calling out orders in his powerful voice.\n\"More light orbs! The darkness down there isn't normal darkness.\"\nCaptain Nerus, head of the royal guard, swam into the hall with a scowl on his face. Behind him floated six angrylooking military officers.\n\"This is madness, my king,\" Nerus said. His webbed hand pointed at the piles of supplies. \"You're risking everything on a human's feeling.\"\nTharros's golden eyes narrowed. \"Careful, Captain.\"\n\"The Leviathan attacked us from the trenches,\" Nerus continued, ignoring the warning. \"Now you want to follow it home? You're inviting disaster!\"\nSophia watched from across the room as more soldiers joined the group. The air grew thick with tension.\n\"The Leviathan will return whether we act or not,\" Tharros replied calmly. \"Better to face it on our terms.\"\n\"Face it? You can barely swim after the last battle!\" shouted another soldier.\nSophia felt anger bubble inside her. These people didn't understand what was calling her. They hadn't felt the pull.\nKael stepped between the king and his soldiers. \"This isn't about following the Leviathan. It's about finding what created it.\"\n\"And bringing more danger to our kingdom?\" Captain Nerus swam closer, his face turning purple with rage. \"This human has been here mere months, and suddenly we're breaking our oldest laws for her?\"\nSomething snapped inside Sophia. The water around her hands began to spin.\n\"My name is Sophia,\" she said, her voice cutting through the noise. \"And I'm not just 'a human' anymore.\"\nThe spinning water grew into a whirlpool between her palms. Everyone stopped arguing and turned to watch. Even Sophia looked surprised at her own power.\nThe whirlpool grew, pulling water from around the room. Items started flying into its center - dust, bits of coral, tiny shells. As they spun faster, they began to glow with strange blue light.\n\"Sophia...\" Arin whispered, moving closer. \"What are you doing?\"\n\"I'm not sure,\" Sophia admitted. \"It's happening on its own.\"\nThe blue light brightened, and suddenly the swirling debris formed patterns. Not random shapes, but words - ancient Aquarian symbols floating in the vortex.\nArin gasped. \"Those are the same symbols from the Whale Song prophecy!\"\nEveryone crowded around, their arguments forgotten. The glowing symbols changed and shifted in the water.\n\"'The darkness rises from below,'\" Tharros translated slowly. \"'Only the four united can restore the ancient balance.'\"\nThe symbols shifted again.\n\"'What was sundered must be rejoined,'\" Arin read, her voice trembling. \"'The light bearer must return what was taken.'\"\nSophia felt the pull in her chest connect directly to the whirlpool. The words made sense in a way she couldn't explain.\n\"That's me,\" she whispered. \"I'm supposed to return something.\"\nThe water collapsed suddenly, the symbols vanishing as quickly as they had appeared. Sophia swayed on her feet, drained from the unexpected magic.\nCaptain Nerus floated back, his face pale. \"The water spoke,\" he said, his voice filled with awe. \"I haven't seen such magic since my grandfather's time.\"\nThe tension in the room had transformed to wonder. Even the doubtful soldiers now looked at Sophia with new respect.\n\"Will you still try to stop us?\" Tharros asked quietly.\nNerus bowed his head. \"No, my king. But I insist on providing guards to escort you to the edge of the trenches.\"\n\"Agreed,\" Tharros said with a nod.\nAs the soldiers dispersed, Sophia sank onto a nearby bench. Her friends gathered around her.\n\"That was incredible,\" Kael said, squeezing her shoulder. \"Your powers are growing.\"\n\"Growing too fast,\" Sophia replied, rubbing her chest where the pull still ached. \"I didn't mean to do that.\"\n\"The trenches are calling you,\" Arin said, her dark eyes serious. \"Your connection is getting stronger.\"\n\"But what am I supposed to return?\" Sophia asked, looking between her friends. \"I don't have anything that belongs to the deep.\"\nTharros touched the map gently. \"Perhaps we'll discover that when we get there.\"\nSunset painted the waters in shades of gold and purple as they made final preparations. Word had spread through the kingdom about their mission. Crowds gathered in the palace courtyard, watching silently as they loaded the last supplies onto four sleek vessels designed for deep water.\n\"These will protect you until you reach the first marker on the map,\" explained the royal engineer, pointing to the bubbleshaped crafts. \"After that, you must rely on your own abilities and magic.\"\nSophia ran her hand over her vessel's smooth surface. It looked fragile for such a dangerous journey.\nA solemn melody filled the courtyard. Twelve Aquarian priestesses had formed a circle, their voices rising in an ancient blessing for those who journey into darkness.\n\"They're singing the Farewell to the Lost,\" Kael whispered to Sophia. \"It's usually reserved for those not expected to return.\"\nSophia swallowed hard. \"That's comforting.\"\n\"It's actually an honor,\" Arin corrected, adjusting her bag of magical items. \"They're acknowledging our sacrifice.\"\nAs the song reached its peak, Sophia noticed tears on the faces of many watching. These people believed they were going to their deaths. Maybe they were right.\nAn elder approached, carrying four small shells on a cushion. \"Blow these if you find yourselves separated,\" she explained. \"The sound will travel through water and rock, guiding you back to each other.\"\nThey each took a shell, tying them around their necks with silver thread.\n\"It's time,\" Tharros said as the sun disappeared completely.\nThe four friends climbed into their vessels. The crowd parted to clear a path to the eastern gates - the entrance to the deep waters that eventually led to the trenches.\nSophia's heart pounded as her vessel sealed around her. Through the clear bubble, she could see thousands of Aquarians gathering, their bioluminescent features glowing in the darkening water.\n\"Ready?\" Tharros asked through the communication system linking their vessels.\n\"Ready,\" they responded together.\nThe vessels hummed to life, gliding forward through the gates and into the darkness beyond. Sophia watched the lights of Aquaria fade behind them. Ahead lay only darkness and the mysterious pull that had been calling her since the battle.\nAs they descended, something moved in the deep darkness below. Something massive. Something waiting.\nSophia pressed her hand against her chest, feeling the pull grow stronger.\n\"We're coming,\" she whispered. \"Whatever you are, we're coming.\"\nWhispers in the Dark\nThe four vessels glided deeper into the ocean's embrace. Sophia watched through her bubble as Aquaria's glow faded completely. Darkness wrapped around them like a thick blanket.\n\"Status check,\" Tharros's voice crackled through the communication system.\n\"All good,\" Kael responded.\n\"Working fine,\" Arin added.\nSophia pressed the talk button. \"I'm okay.\" But the pull in her chest had grown stronger, almost painful now. Something down there wanted her - badly.\nTheir vessels' headlights cut small paths through the darkness. They had entered the twilight zone, where sunlight couldn't reach. Soon, even their powerful lights wouldn't be enough.\n\"Look,\" Kael said, pointing to their right.\nTiny lights began to appear in the darkness - blue, green, and purple dots floating around them. As Sophia's eyes adjusted, she gasped. Thousands of glowing creatures surrounded them, creating a living galaxy in the deep.\n\"Bioluminescent jellyfish,\" Arin explained. \"They're our guides now.\"\nSophia pressed her hand against the clear bubble of her vessel. The jellyfish nearby pulsed brighter, as if responding to her. Curious, she focused on them, wondering if they could come closer.\nTo her amazement, the jellyfish swirled toward her vessel, creating a beautiful spiral of light.\n\"They're listening to me,\" she whispered, astonished.\n\"What do you mean?\" Tharros asked.\n\"I just... thought about them coming closer, and they did.\" Sophia concentrated again, picturing the jellyfish forming an arrow shape. Slowly, they rearranged themselves exactly as she had imagined.\nArin's voice came through filled with excitement. \"Sophia, you're communicating with them! That's extremely rare magic - even I can't do that.\"\n\"Can you ask them about safe passages?\" Kael suggested.\nSophia closed her eyes, focusing on the creatures surrounding them. In her mind, she pictured dangerous areas ahead and safe routes through them. When she opened her eyes, the jellyfish had formed a bright path forward, curving slightly to the left instead of straight down.\n\"I think they're showing us the way,\" she said.\nTharros's vessel moved first, following the living light path. \"Then let's trust them.\"\nAs they descended further, the water pressure increased. Sophia's vessel creaked slightly, the sound making her heart beat faster. The map showed they were approaching the true beginning of the trench - still far from the mysterious spiral symbol, but already deeper than most Aquarians ever ventured.\n\"Pressure holding steady,\" Tharros reported. \"Everyone okay?\"\nBefore anyone could answer, a powerful current slammed into their vessels, sending them spinning. Sophia grabbed her controls, fighting to stabilize. Through the chaos, she saw Kael and Arin doing the same. Tharros's larger vessel recovered first.\n\"What was that?\" Arin asked, her voice shaky.\n\"Deepsea current,\" Kael explained. \"They can appear without warning down here.\"\nThe jellyfish scattered in the turbulence, their orderly path now broken. Sophia concentrated again, calling them back. They responded, but formed a different pattern - now urgently pointing to the right.\n\"Something's wrong,\" Sophia said. \"They want us to change direction.\"\n\"I see why,\" Tharros replied grimly. \"Look ahead.\"\nIn the distance, orangered lights glowed in the darkness. As they drew closer, Sophia saw massive columns of bubbling water shooting upward from the ocean floor - underwater volcanoes spewing superheated water.\n\"Thermal vents,\" Arin said. \"The map doesn't show them here.\"\n\"The map is centuries old,\" Kael reminded them. \"The seafloor changes.\"\nSophia studied the scene before them. The thermal vents formed a mazelike barrier stretching as far as their lights could reveal. Between the columns, dark water flowed in narrow passages - possibly safe routes, possibly deadly traps.\n\"We need to find a way through,\" Tharros said.\nSophia closed her eyes again, asking the jellyfish to show them a safe path. When she looked, they had formed a twisting line through the vents. But as the team started to follow, something strange happened.\nThe vents began to move, shifting position like living things. What had been an open passage suddenly closed as two vents slid together, blocking their way.\n\"That's impossible,\" Kael whispered. \"Thermal vents don't move.\"\n\"These do,\" Arin replied, her voice tense. \"There's magic at work here.\"\nThe jellyfish scattered again, confused by the changing landscape. Sophia tried to call them back, but they stayed at a distance, pulsing nervously.\n\"They're afraid,\" she realized. \"Something about these vents scares them.\"\nTharros's vessel moved forward cautiously. \"We need to get closer to understand what we're dealing with.\"\nAs they approached the first vent, Sophia noticed strange markings carved into the rock around its base. They resembled the symbols from the whirlpool vision, but older, more primitive.\n\"Arin, can you read these?\" she asked, sending images through their communication system.\nThe sea witch studied them for a moment. \"They're protection symbols,\" she finally said. \"Very ancient ones. Someone created this maze as a barrier.\"\n\"To keep people out of the trenches?\" Kael asked.\n\"Or to keep something in,\" Tharros added darkly.\nAs they hovered at the edge of the vent field, trying to decide their next move, Sophia felt a shift in the pulling sensation. Instead of a general tug downward, it now pointed specifically to the center of the maze.\n\"Whatever's calling me is through there,\" she said, pointing.\n\"But how do we get through? The passages keep changing,\" Kael asked.\nSophia studied the moving vents, noticing a pattern in their shifting. \"They're not random,\" she realized. \"They're reacting to our approach. Like they're testing us.\"\nArin's voice brightened with understanding. \"A living defense system! I've read about these in ancient texts. They respond to intent.\"\n\"Meaning?\" Tharros asked.\n\"Meaning if we try to force our way through, the maze will become more complicated,\" Arin explained. \"But if we approach with the right... attitude, it might let us pass.\"\nSophia thought about the pull in her chest, how it felt like an invitation rather than a threat. \"I think I know what to do,\" she said. \"Follow me, but stay close.\"\nShe guided her vessel forward slowly, projecting her thoughts outward: We come seeking understanding, not conquest. We follow the call.\nThe nearest vent shifted, opening a narrow passage. Heart pounding, Sophia guided her vessel through. The others followed in single file.\nAs they moved deeper into the maze, the vents continued to shift around them. Sometimes passages would close behind them, cutting off retreat. Other times, new openings would appear, offering alternative routes. Sophia followed the pull, choosing paths that felt right rather than those that looked easiest.\n\"It's working,\" Kael whispered after they successfully navigated a particularly tight passage.\nThe temperature rose as they reached the center of the maze. Here, the largest vent of all rose like a tower, its base circled with more ancient symbols. The pull in Sophia's chest now felt like a physical rope, drawing her toward the central vent.\n\"This is it,\" she said. \"Whatever's calling me is down there.\"\nTharros moved his vessel closer to the main vent, examining the opening. \"There's a tunnel inside,\" he reported. \"It seems to lead straight down.\"\n\"Into the trench proper,\" Arin added, checking their map. \"This isn't on the chart at all.\"\nAs they prepared to enter the tunnel, Sophia noticed the jellyfish had returned, hovering at a distance. But they weren't alone. Larger shapes moved in the darkness beyond their lights - shadowy forms watching from the edge of visibility.\n\"We're being observed,\" Kael said, his warrior senses alert.\nSophia focused on the shadows, trying to communicate as she had with the jellyfish. Instead of a response, she felt something brush against her mind - a cold, ancient presence that made her gasp.\nAt last, a voice whispered directly into her thoughts. The bearer returns.\n\"Did you hear that?\" Sophia asked, her voice shaking.\nHer friends exchanged confused looks. \"Hear what?\" Tharros asked.\nBefore Sophia could explain, the central vent suddenly erupted with greater force, creating a powerful suction that caught their vessels. Alarms blared as they were pulled toward the tunnel.\n\"Engines at full!\" Tharros shouted. \"Resist the pull!\"\nBut their vessels' motors whined in protest, unable to fight the current. One by one, they were dragged into the tunnel's mouth.\nAs Sophia's vessel entered the darkness, the voice in her mind returned, clearer this time:\nWelcome home, light bearer. We have waited so long.\nThe tunnel swallowed them completely, carrying them deeper into the abyss than any Aquarian had gone before. Into the heart of the trenches, where ancient secrets waited in the crushing dark.\nGhosts of the Past\nThe tunnel swallowed their vessels whole, carrying them through twisting darkness. Sophia's stomach lurched as they plummeted deeper, spinning like leaves in a storm. Warning lights flashed inside her bubble as the pressure increased.\n\"Vessel integrity at sixty percent!\" Tharros called through the crackling communication system. \"We're descending too fast!\"\nSophia gripped her controls, but they responded sluggishly. The pull in her chest had become almost pleasant now, like a welcome rather than a demand.\n\"I think we're supposed to let go,\" she called back. \"Stop fighting it!\"\n\"Are you crazy?\" Kael's voice was sharp with fear. \"We'll be crushed!\"\nBut Arin's voice cut in, calm amid the chaos. \"She's right. This is another test. Trust, not force.\"\nOne by one, they powered down their engines. The vessels continued to fall, but the violent spinning eased. The tunnel walls glowed faintly now, illuminating their descent with soft blue light.\nWith a sudden whoosh, they burst from the tunnel into an enormous underwater cavern. Their vessels slowed naturally, coming to rest on a sandy floor. Beyond their bubbles stretched a vast open space, its ceiling too high to see, its walls curving away into darkness.\n\"Where are we?\" Kael asked, his voice hushed with awe.\n\"According to the map,\" Tharros replied, \"nowhere. This place doesn't exist.\"\nSophia pressed her face to her vessel's clear bubble. Strange rock formations rose from the cavern floor, twisting like frozen dancers. But what caught her eye were the lights - thousands of tiny blue flames floating freely through the water, neither rising nor falling.\n\"Can we exit the vessels?\" Arin asked, already checking her readings. \"The pressure seems... normal. That's impossible at this depth.\"\n\"Only one way to find out,\" Tharros said. With a hiss, his vessel's hatch opened. Water didn't rush in as expected. Instead, he emerged dry, as if the water respectfully held itself back from him.\nOne by one, they left their protective bubbles. The water around them felt thick yet breathable, more like air than liquid. They could speak normally, their voices carrying clearly.\n\"The ancient texts mentioned places like this,\" Arin whispered, reaching out to touch one of the floating blue flames. \"Bubble realms, they called them. Pockets where the normal rules don't apply.\"\nAs they ventured further into the cavern, the blue flames began to move, gathering together in the center of the space. They swirled faster and faster, forming a whirlpool of light.\n\"Stay alert,\" Kael warned, his hand on his weapon.\nFrom the whirlpool, a figure emerged - tall and flowing, its body made entirely of water yet somehow holding its shape. Where a face should be, only ripples appeared, constantly shifting like disturbed water. The blue flames orbited it like tiny moons.\n\"Welcome, seekers,\" it said, its voice seeming to come from everywhere at once. \"Few reach this chamber.\"\nSophia stepped forward, drawn by the pull in her chest. \"Who are you?\"\n\"I am the Guardian of Memories,\" the figure replied. \"I protect what must not be forgotten.\"\nThe guardian moved closer, its watery form towering over them. \"You seek passage to the deeper trenches. But first, you must be worthy.\"\n\"How do we prove ourselves?\" Tharros asked, his golden eyes narrowed.\n\"By facing what you hide even from yourselves.\" The guardian raised its arms, and the blue flames shot toward each of them, circling their heads like crowns. \"Your deepest pains must be shared to proceed.\"\nSophia felt a strange coldness spread from the flames into her mind. Suddenly, she wasn't in the cavern anymore. She stood in her parents' living room, five years earlier.\n\"Marine biology?\" her father's voice was heavy with disappointment. \"All your talent, your perfect scores in medicine, and you choose to study fish?\"\n\"It's what I love, Dad,\" her younger self replied, fighting back tears.\n\"Love doesn't pay bills,\" her mother added. \"Dr. Rodriguez had such a nice ring to it. A real doctor, not someone who names new types of seaweed.\"\nThe memory was so vivid Sophia could smell her mother's perfume, feel the ache in her throat as she held back tears. She had never told her friends how deeply her parents' disapproval had wounded her, how she sometimes still doubted her choices on lonely nights.\nThe scene dissolved, and she was back in the cavern. Tears streamed down her face. Beside her, her friends were also lost in painful memories.\nKael knelt on the cavern floor, his face twisted in anguish. In his mind, he relived the day he learned the truth - that he wasn't just any mer warrior, but the lost prince of the Eastern Reefs, hidden away as a baby when his kingdom fell. The knowledge that his royal parents had chosen kingdom over child, sending him away to be raised by strangers.\n\"I was nothing but a spare heir,\" he whispered, his voice breaking. \"Insurance against extinction.\"\nNearby, Tharros roared in pain as he witnessed again the death of his first mate, Lyra, centuries ago. Her scales dimming as a human harpoon pierced her heart. His failure to reach her in time. The centuries of loneliness that followed, his heart turned to stone by grief.\n\"I swore never to love again,\" he growled, golden tears sliding down his face. \"Never to risk such pain.\"\nArin floated slightly above the floor, her dark energy swirling chaotically as she revisited her exile. The faces of her coven sisters turning cold as they discovered her experimenting with forbidden magic. The ritual of banishment, stripping her of her coven name. The years of solitude that followed, building her power alone while hunger for acceptance gnawed at her heart.\n\"I only wanted to be extraordinary,\" she whispered. \"To be seen.\"\nThe Guardian of Memories watched silently as each struggled with their private pain. Then it spoke again, its voice gentler now.\n\"Pain hoarded grows heavier. Pain shared becomes bearable.\"\nSophia understood suddenly. Wiping away tears, she moved to Kael's side and placed a hand on his shoulder.\n\"Tell us,\" she said softly. \"Tell us about the day you learned who you were.\"\nKael looked up, surprised. Then slowly, haltingly, he began to speak. The words came difficult at first, then faster, like water breaking through a dam. He told them everything - the discovery of his royal birthmark during battle training, the elder's confession, his rage and confusion afterward.\nAs he spoke, the blue flames around his head dimmed slightly.\nUnderstanding now, Tharros moved to join them, sharing the full story of Lyra, details he'd kept buried for centuries. Arin followed, revealing the depths of her loneliness and her desperate search for belonging.\nFinally, Sophia told them about her parents' disappointment, how their rejection had driven her to prove herself, eventually leading her to the research mission that changed everything.\nAs each story finished, the blue flames surrounding them grew dimmer. When the last word was spoken, the flames vanished completely.\nThe Guardian of Memories moved forward, its watery form now glowing softly from within.\n\"Well done,\" it said. \"Few have the courage to share their deepest wounds.\"\nThe cavern floor began to shift, opening a new passage downward.\n\"The path to the heart of the abyss is open to you,\" the Guardian continued. \"But heed this warning: what you seek is not what you imagine. The abyss remembers what the surface forgot.\"\n\"What does that mean?\" Sophia asked, the phrase eerily familiar.\n\"It means,\" the Guardian replied, its form already beginning to dissolve, \"that the truth awaiting you is older than your civilizations. Older than your kinds. The Leviathan is but a symptom of a greater imbalance.\"\n\"Wait!\" Tharros called. \"What imbalance?\"\nBut the Guardian was fading, its watery body rejoining the cavern pool. Its final words echoed around them:\n\"What was sundered must be rejoined. The light bearer must return what was taken.\"\nThen it was gone, leaving only the new passage and the echo of its cryptic message.\nThe four friends stood closer now, the sharing of their painful memories having forged a deeper bond between them. They looked at each other, then at the dark passage that would take them further into the abyss.\n\"I don't know what awaits us down there,\" Sophia said, \"but I'm glad it's us facing it together.\"\nKael squeezed her hand. \"No more secrets between us.\"\n\"No more hiding,\" Arin agreed.\nTharros nodded solemnly. \"Together, then.\"\nAs they approached the new passage, Sophia felt the pull in her chest change again, becoming more urgent. Something below was growing impatient.\nThe blue flames reappeared, forming a path down into the darkness. As Sophia took the first step downward, she heard a whisper at the edge of her mind:\nHurry, light bearer. Time grows short. What was forgotten stirs again.\nThe Glowing Heart\nThe blue flames led them down the new passage, twisting deeper into the abyss. Sophia's heart pounded as the strange pull in her chest grew stronger with each step. The shared memories had left them all raw but somehow closer, like wounds that had finally been cleaned.\n\"Does anyone else feel like we're being watched?\" Kael whispered, his warrior senses on high alert.\nBefore anyone could answer, the narrow passage suddenly opened into an immense cavern that took their breath away. Stretching before them was an underwater forest unlike anything they'd ever seen. Towering coral structures rose like ancient trees, pulsing with brilliant bluegreen light. Some reached higher than skyscrapers, their branches forming a canopy that scattered light in dazzling patterns across the seafloor.\n\"Impossible,\" Tharros murmured, golden eyes wide with wonder. \"These species went extinct thousands of years ago.\"\nSophia stepped forward, scientist and magical being both captivated by the sight. \"It's beautiful.\"\nAs she moved closer to one coral trunk, it brightened in response, the glow following her hand when she reached toward it. When she touched its surface, a ripple of light raced up the trunk and spread through the branches. Soon, the entire forest was pulsing in rhythm with her heartbeat.",

        "content": "\"It's responding to you,\" Arin said, dark energy swirling excitedly around her fingers. \"It's almost like it's... alive.\"\n\"Not almost,\" Tharros corrected. \"The Ancient Luminaries were said to be halfplant, halfsentient being. The old stories called them the First Thinkers of the deep.\"\nThe forest floor was carpeted with smaller corals that illuminated their footsteps as they ventured deeper. Fish unlike any Sophia had studied darted between the trunks, their transparent bodies carrying the forest's light within them.\n\"We should stay together,\" Kael warned. \"This place feels... strange.\"\nBut even as he spoke, the forest began to change around them. The light pulsed faster, and a sweet, songlike humming filled the water. Sophia felt suddenly dizzy, the pull in her chest now spreading throughout her body.\n\"Something's happening,\" she called out, but her voice sounded distant to her own ears.\nThe forest floor shifted beneath them. Glowing coral walls rose suddenly between them, cutting off their paths from one another.\n\"Sophia!\" Kael's voice came from far away, muffled by the living walls.\n\"Stay calm!\" she shouted back. \"It's responding to our emotions!\"\nBut the forest had other ideas. The coral walls grew thicker, separating them completely. Sophia found herself alone in a small clearing, the humming sound growing louder.\nThen the light changed, forming shapes in front of her. To her shock, she saw her parents smiling proudly at her, their expressions warm with approval.\n\"We were wrong, Sophia,\" her father's image said. \"Your work has changed the world.\"\nHer mother nodded. \"We're so proud of the scientist you've become.\"\nSophia's heart ached with longing. She reached out, almost believing, before pulling her hand back. \"You're not real,\" she whispered. \"You're what I wish was real.\"\nThe images wavered but didn't disappear.\nMeanwhile, Kael found himself standing before the restored Eastern Reef palace. His royal parents bowed to him, offering him the crown.\n\"Our son,\" they said. \"You have restored our kingdom. Take your rightful place.\"\nHis throat tightened with emotion, but he shook his head. \"You're just echoes of what might have been.\"\nElsewhere, Tharros faced an image of Lyra, his lost mate, her scales shimmering just as he remembered.\n\"You've suffered long enough,\" her image whispered. \"Stay here with me, where time doesn't touch us.\"\nA golden tear slid down his face. \"You're beautiful,\" he said hoarsely. \"But you're not her.\"\nArin confronted her old coven, their arms open in welcome, their faces no longer cold with judgment.\n\"Come home,\" they beckoned. \"All is forgiven.\"\nHer dark energy flickered. \"A pretty lie,\" she said, though her voice broke. \"But still a lie.\"\nIn her clearing, Sophia closed her eyes, trying to think past the sweet humming and the pull of her deepest wish. She remembered the Guardian's test-sharing pain had been the key.\n\"It's testing us again,\" she realized aloud. She reached for the strange new power inside her, the one that had awakened since her transformation. Light bloomed from her skin, pushing back against the coral's glow.\n\"Tharros! Kael! Arin!\" she called, focusing on their connection. \"These are illusions! The forest is showing us what we most want!\"\nHer voice seemed to travel through the light itself. The others heard her, faint but clear.\n\"How do we break free?\" Kael called back.\n\"The same way we passed the last test,\" she answered. \"By letting go!\"\nOne by one, they turned away from their deepest wishes. As they rejected the illusions, the coral walls began to thin.\nSophia pushed harder, channeling her light through the water. \"Follow my light!\"\nThe others focused on her glow, using it as a beacon. The forest hummed louder, almost as if pleased rather than thwarted. The walls melted away, and suddenly they were together again in a new clearing, larger than before.\n\"That was...\" Arin shivered.\n\"A test,\" Tharros finished for her. \"But why test us again?\"\n\"I don't think it was testing us,\" Sophia said slowly. \"I think it was... measuring us.\"\nAt the center of the clearing stood a single coral trunk, thicker and taller than all the others. As they approached, it split open like a door, revealing a small chamber within. Inside, four lumps of coral rested on a shelf, each pulsing with inner light-one blue, one gold, one green, and one purple.\n\"What are they?\" Kael asked, reaching for the green one.\nAs his fingers touched it, the lump reshaped itself, wrapping around his wrist like a living bracelet. The others did the same when touched, each choosing a different wearer-the gold one to Tharros, the purple to Arin, and the blue to Sophia.\n\"They're guides,\" Arin whispered, feeling the coral pulse against her skin. \"I can sense it-they'll light our way through the darkness ahead.\"\nThe moment the last bracelet attached itself to Sophia, the forest's humming changed to a single clear note. In their minds, they all heard the same message:\nThe abyss grows darker. Ancient shadows gather. You will need light to find what was lost and face what was forgotten.\n\"It's helping us,\" Sophia said with wonder.\nTharros nodded grimly. \"Which means whatever awaits us is worse than we imagined.\"\nThe passage at the far end of the clearing opened wider, revealing a steep descent into blackness. Their coral bracelets brightened in response, as if preparing for the challenge ahead.\n\"Do we continue?\" Kael asked, though they all knew the answer.\n\"We have to,\" Sophia said, feeling the familiar pull stronger than ever. \"Whatever's calling me-calling us-needs us now.\"\nTogether, they approached the dark passage. Their bracelets cast just enough light to see a few steps ahead, but beyond that was complete darkness. The coral forest hummed behind them, a final farewell.\nAs they took their first steps downward, Sophia's bracelet pulsed with an urgent rhythm. A whisper brushed against her mind, different from the forest's voice:\nHurry, light bearer. The darkness stirs. Some secrets were buried for a reason.\nSophia's skin prickled with goosebumps. She glanced back at the glowing forest one last time before the darkness swallowed them whole.\nThe Singing Abyss\nThe darkness swallowed them whole as they descended deeper into the passage. Only their coral bracelets provided light, casting eerie glows against the rocky walls-Sophia's blue, Tharros's gold, Kael's green, and Arin's purple creating a rainbow of colors that danced as they moved.\n\"How much farther do we go?\" Kael whispered, his voice tense.\nThe moment his words left his mouth, something strange happened. Sophia saw ripples of green light flow from his lips, spreading through the water like rings in a pond. She blinked, wondering if she was imagining things.\n\"Did anyone else see that?\" she asked.\n\"See what?\" Tharros rumbled.\nAgain, Sophia watched in wonder as golden ripples flowed from his mouth, spreading outward before fading.\n\"The sound,\" she said, reaching out to touch the fading ripples from her own blue words. \"I can see it!\"\nArin studied her closely. \"What do you mean you can 'see' sound?\"\nBefore Sophia could answer, the narrow passage suddenly opened up. The small circle of light from their bracelets couldn't reach far enough to show what lay ahead, but they felt a vast emptiness before them. The pull in Sophia's chest tugged her forward, stronger than ever.\n\"We need more light,\" Tharros said, extending his hand. His bracelet brightened in response, but still barely penetrated the darkness.\nSophia closed her eyes, feeling the strange new awareness growing inside her. Every small sound-their breathing, the shifting of their bodies, water dripping from somewhere far away-created patterns of light behind her eyelids.\n\"Let me try something,\" she said.\nFollowing her instincts, Sophia clapped her hands together. The sound erupted from her palms in a burst of blue light that traveled outward like a sonar ping. As it spread, it revealed glimpses of their surroundings.\n\"Whoa,\" Kael breathed.\n\"Do it again,\" Arin urged.\nSophia clapped again, harder, and this time the soundlight traveled farther. What it revealed stole their breath away.\nThey stood at the edge of an enormous chasm that cut through the ocean floor like a wound. So deep that its bottom was lost in darkness, so wide that the opposite side was barely visible. Their passage had led them to a narrow ledge that ran along one wall.\n\"The Chasm of Whispers,\" Tharros said in awe. \"I thought it was just a legend.\"\nWhen he spoke, his words echoed, bouncing back and forth across the vast space. Sophia watched, amazed, as these echoes created patterns of light that lingered in the water.\n\"This place is alive with sound,\" she whispered, sending tiny ripples of blue dancing from her lips.\nKael pointed ahead. \"Look, the ledge forms a path. It seems to go all the way around.\"\nArin nodded. \"We need to keep moving. The Leviathan's trail leads deeper.\"\nThey began walking singlefile along the narrow ledge, with Kael leading and Tharros bringing up the rear. Every sound they made-footsteps, breathing, the occasional word-created light patterns that Sophia could now see clearly.\n\"It's beautiful,\" she said, watching the ripples of their movements paint the darkness with color.\nThen she noticed something odd. Far below, in the depths of the chasm, other ripples were moving-patterns not caused by them. Her skin prickled with warning.\n\"Wait,\" she hissed. \"Something's down there.\"\nThey froze, peering into the darkness. At first, they saw nothing. Then Kael pointed to a spot where the shadows seemed to shift.\n\"There!\"\nA swarm of creatures rose from the depths, attracted by their sounds. Snakelike bodies with oversized jaws twisted through the water, but where eyes should be, they had only smooth skin.\n\"Echo eels,\" Tharros growled. \"They hunt by sound.\"\nThe swarm circled below them, growing more agitated with each word spoken. Sophia watched the sound ripples travel down to the creatures, who immediately turned toward the source.\n\"Don't make a noise,\" Arin breathed, her words barely disturbing the water.\nBut it was too late. The swarm surged upward, jaws opening to reveal rows of needlesharp teeth.\n\"Run!\" Kael shouted.\nThey sprinted along the narrow ledge, the echo eels right behind them. Every footstep, every panicked breath sent more soundripples outward, drawing the blind predators closer.\n\"They're following our sounds!\" Sophia realized. Then an idea struck her. \"Wait, I can use that!\"\nStopping suddenly, she turned to face the swarm. She closed her eyes, focusing on the patterns of sound around her. When she opened them again, she could see the intricate web of vibrations flowing through the water.\nWith newfound instinct, Sophia reached out her hands and caught a sound ripple, bending it like light through a prism. She sent it shooting away from them, down a different tunnel.\nThe lead eels changed direction, following the redirected sound.\n\"How did you do that?\" Kael asked in amazement.\n\"I don't know,\" Sophia replied. \"I just... felt it.\"\nBut more eels were coming. Each word they spoke drew another wave of predators.\n\"I need a bigger sound,\" Sophia said, scanning their surroundings.\nTharros understood immediately. Drawing in a deep breath, he released a dragon's roar that shook the very water around them. The sound exploded from him in a massive wave of golden light.\nSophia caught the wave with both hands, feeling its power vibrate through her bones. With a pushing motion, she bent the entire soundwave downward, sending it deep into the chasm.\nThe swarm of echo eels followed the massive sound, diving back into the depths.\n\"That was incredible,\" Arin whispered, her purple eyes wide.\n\"We should keep moving,\" Sophia said, still trembling from the effort. \"They'll be back once they realize there's nothing there.\"\nThey continued along the ledge, moving as quietly as possible. Sophia's new awareness of sound showed her things the others couldn't see-currents flowing through the chasm, distant movements, even the slow groan of the rock itself.\nAfter what felt like hours, the ledge widened into a small platform. As they stepped onto it, their coral bracelets suddenly brightened, illuminating the wall beside them.\n\"Look!\" Arin gasped.\nThe wall was covered in ancient carvings, so old that some had nearly worn away. They depicted an underwater city of incredible beauty-Aquaria in its earliest days. Figures with tails, wings, and human forms worked together to build towers of coral and crystal.\n\"The founding of Aquaria,\" Tharros said softly, tracing a carving with his finger.\nBut as they moved along the wall, the images changed. Darkness spread from the bottom of the sea. A massive creature with countless tentacles rose from the deep trench, its body black as night. Against it stood four figures, their hands joined, light streaming from their bodies.\n\"The Leviathan,\" Kael whispered.\nSophia stepped closer, studying the four figures. One had scales like Tharros, another carried a trident like Kael, and a third was surrounded by swirling patterns that resembled Arin's magic. But the fourth figure-the one in the center-was surrounded by soundripples identical to the ones Sophia could now see.\n\"They look like us,\" she said, her voice barely audible.\n\"Not like us,\" Arin corrected, her face pale in the glow of her bracelet. \"They are us. Or we are them.\"\nTharros's golden eyes narrowed. \"The prophecy is older than we thought.\"\nThe final carving showed the four figures descending into a massive trench, toward the heart of darkness. Their fate was not carved-the story ended there, unfinished.\nSophia felt the pull in her chest grow painful, urgent. She pressed her hand against the wall, and her bracelet pulsed in response. Beneath her fingers, hidden words began to glow, written in a language she somehow understood.\n\"'What was sundered must be rejoined,'\" she read aloud. \"'The light bearer must return what was taken.'\"\nThe same words the Guardian had spoken.\n\"What does it mean?\" Kael asked.\nBefore Sophia could answer, a deep rumble shook the chasm. Cracks appeared in the ancient carvings as dust and small rocks rained down from above.\n\"Something's coming,\" Tharros warned, his body tensing.\nThe rumbling grew stronger. Far below, at the bottom of the chasm, a faint glow began to spread-not the bluegreen of the coral forest, but a sickly purpleblack that seemed to devour light rather than create it.\n\"We need to go,\" Arin urged. \"Now!\"\nAs they turned to run, Sophia glanced back at the carvings one last time. In the shifting light, she could have sworn the fourth figure-her figure-moved, lifting a hand in warning.\nThen the ledge beneath them collapsed, and they plunged into darkness.\nThe Warrior's Path\nThe world spun as they fell through darkness. Sophia's scream created brilliant blue ripples that lit up their descent. Just as panic threatened to overwhelm them, they splashed into a pool of glowing water that cushioned their fall.\n\"Is everyone okay?\" Sophia gasped, pushing wet hair from her face.\nThree voices answered in the affirmative as they dragged themselves onto a rocky shore. Their coral bracelets pulsed urgently, as if warning them of something.\n\"Where are we?\" Arin asked, wringing water from her robes.\nTharros raised his glowing bracelet. They had landed in a small cave with only one way out-a narrow tunnel carved into the rock wall. It was barely wide enough for a person to squeeze through.\n\"Down,\" he said grimly. \"We're deeper than before.\"\nThe strange pull in Sophia's chest tugged her toward the tunnel. \"We need to go that way.\"\nKael approached the opening, sizing it up with a warrior's eye. \"I'll go first.\"\nWithout waiting for agreement, he pushed his broad shoulders into the tight space. At first, he made good progress, inching forward with powerful strokes. But about ten feet in, his movement stopped.\n\"I'm stuck,\" he called back, his voice creating green ripples that showed his predicament. The tunnel had narrowed to a pinch point, trapping him.\n\"Can you back out?\" Tharros asked.\nKael struggled, muscles straining. \"No. Something's holding me.\"\nSophia peered into the tunnel, her new soundsight revealing what the others couldn't see. The rock walls weren't just static stone-they pulsed with faint energy, contracting around Kael's body.\n\"The passage is reacting to you,\" she said. \"It's tightening because you're fighting it.\"\n\"What am I supposed to do?\" Kael growled, frustration evident. \"Not fight?\"\n\"Maybe,\" Arin suggested. \"Remember what the Guardian said about trust, not force?\"\nKael took a deep breath, trying to relax his powerful muscles. To his surprise, the passage loosened slightly, allowing him to slide back out.\n\"This doesn't make sense,\" he said, running a hand through his tangled hair. \"I'm the strongest swimmer. I should be able to force my way through.\"\nTharros studied the tunnel with golden eyes. \"Perhaps strength isn't the answer this time.\"\nWhile they debated what to do, Sophia noticed something on the cave wall near the tunnel entrance. Faint markings, similar to the carvings they'd seen in the chasm. She pressed her hand against them, and her bracelet brightened in response.\nThe markings began to glow, revealing more ancient images. These showed the Leviathan again, but not as a monster. Instead, it appeared majestic, guarding the deepest trenches of the ocean.\n\"Look at this,\" she called to the others. \"The Leviathan wasn't always evil.\"\nThey gathered around as she traced the carvings with her finger.\n\"It says the Leviathan was created to protect the balance between surface and sea magic,\" she translated. \"It was a guardian, not a destroyer.\"\n\"What changed it?\" Arin asked.\nSophia moved to the next image, showing a great battle. \"Someone tried to control its power. They... took something from it.\" She squinted at the faded symbols. \"Its heart? No... its light. They took its light.\"\n\"The light bearer must return what was taken,\" Tharros repeated the Guardian's words.\nKael studied the final image-a figure approaching the Leviathan with outstretched hands, offering something that glowed.\n\"So we're not supposed to destroy it,\" he said slowly. \"We're supposed to heal it.\"\nA distant rumble shook the cave, reminding them of the growing danger below.\n\"We need to keep moving,\" Sophia urged. \"But how do we get through the tunnel?\"",

        "content": "Kael stared at the narrow opening, his warrior pride battling with frustration. All his life, he'd relied on strength to overcome obstacles. Now, that same strength was failing him.\n\"Let me try again,\" he said.\n\"Wait.\" Tharros put a hand on his shoulder. \"What if force is the wrong approach? The carvings show healing, not fighting.\"\nKael's eyes widened as understanding dawned. \"Not strength alone, but strength with restraint.\"\nHe approached the tunnel again, but this time with a different mindset. Instead of charging in, he moved slowly, feeling the energy of the passage.\n\"It's like swimming through a coral reef,\" he said. \"You have to move with it, not against it.\"\nInch by inch, he made his way into the tunnel. When he reached the narrow point that had trapped him before, he didn't push harder. Instead, he relaxed, making himself smaller.\nTo everyone's amazement, the passage widened slightly, allowing him through.\n\"It's working!\" his voice echoed back.\nSophia watched through her soundsight as Kael navigated the twisting path. The tunnel wasn't just a physical challenge-it responded to his intentions, his emotions. When he grew frustrated, it tightened. When he stayed calm, it opened.\n\"He's through!\" Arin announced as Kael's green bracelet disappeared around a bend.\n\"I'll go next,\" Sophia volunteered.\nOne by one, they followed Kael's example, moving with gentle purpose rather than force. Sophia found the tunnel surprisingly easy to navigate once she understood its nature. It wasn't meant to stop them-it was testing them.\nThe passage twisted downward, growing darker and colder. After what felt like hours of crawling, Sophia emerged into another cave where Kael waited. Arin followed shortly after.\nThey waited for Tharros, but minutes passed with no sign of him.\n\"He's too big,\" Kael worried. \"His dragon form is massive.\"\n\"He's not in dragon form,\" Arin countered.\nJust as they were about to go back for him, they heard a scraping sound. Tharros emerged from the tunnel, breathing hard, his large frame barely fitting through the opening.\n\"That,\" he panted, \"was not designed for someone my size.\"\nThey helped him to his feet and turned to see what lay ahead. This new cave was larger than the first, with a high ceiling that disappeared into darkness. Their bracelets illuminated a platform surrounded by deep water.\nIn the center of the platform stood a stone pedestal carved with ancient symbols. Atop it rested a single object-a ceremonial dagger with a blade that glowed with the same light as their bracelets.\n\"What is this place?\" Arin wondered.\nKael approached the pedestal cautiously. \"Some kind of shrine?\"\nSophia followed, drawn by the strange pull that had guided them all this way. As she neared the dagger, the feeling in her chest intensified.\n\"I think we're supposed to take it,\" she said.\nKael reached for the weapon, but his hand froze inches away. \"I can't. There's some kind of barrier.\"\nTharros and Arin tried as well, but none could touch the dagger.\n\"Let me try,\" Sophia said.\nWhen her fingers approached the hilt, the barrier parted like water. She lifted the dagger, surprised by its lightness. The moment she held it, the blade's glow brightened, casting sharp shadows across the cave.\n\"Why you?\" Kael asked, not jealously but with genuine curiosity.\nBefore Sophia could answer, the water around the platform began to churn. Something was rising from the depths-something large.\n\"Get behind me,\" Kael ordered, positioning himself protectively in front of the others.\nA massive tentacle broke the surface, then another. Inky black with pulsing purple veins, they reached toward the platform with frightening purpose.\n\"The Leviathan,\" Tharros whispered.\nMore tentacles appeared, surrounding them on all sides. There was nowhere to run.\n\"What do we do?\" Arin's dark energy swirled around her hands, ready to strike.\nSophia stared at the dagger in her hand, then at the approaching tentacles. The pull in her chest wasn't fear anymore-it was recognition.\n\"Wait,\" she said. \"Don't attack.\"\nAs if responding to her voice, the tentacles paused their advance. One moved closer, hovering before her face. Up close, Sophia could see that the corruption wasn't complete-flecks of blue still glimmered within the darkness.\n\"It's in pain,\" she realized. \"It's been in pain for thousands of years.\"\nThe dagger in her hand pulsed with light, matching the rhythm of her heartbeat. Somehow, she understood what needed to be done.\n\"I think I know why I'm the light bearer,\" she said quietly.\nShe took a step toward the waiting tentacle, the dagger held not as a weapon, but as an offering.\n\"Sophia, no!\" Kael moved to stop her, but Tharros held him back.\n\"This is her task,\" the dragon king said. \"Trust her.\"\nAs Sophia reached toward the corrupted limb, the largest tentacle yet rose from the water directly in front of her. At its tip, a single eye opened-ancient and filled with darkness, yet with a tiny spark of light still fighting to survive.\nThe dagger glowed brighter as Sophia raised it. The eye watched her every move.\n\"I'm not here to hurt you,\" she whispered. \"I'm here to help.\"\nThe eye blinked once, and in that moment, Sophia felt a connection form-a bridge between her mind and the ancient creature's. Images flashed through her thoughts: the Leviathan in its original glory, a terrible betrayal, an endless age of darkness and rage.\nBut most clearly, she saw what needed to be done.\nShe turned to her friends, her face set with determination.\n\"We need to go deeper,\" she said. \"To the heart of the abyss.\"\nThe tentacles withdrew, opening a path in the churning water-not away from the Leviathan, but toward it.\nToward the darkest depths of all.\nWhere Light Fears to Tread\nThe tentacles parted like a curtain, revealing a path that plunged straight down into darkness. Sophia clutched the glowing dagger tightly as she peered over the edge. The pull in her chest had grown stronger, urging her toward the unknown depths.\n\"Are we really following the monster that's been terrorizing Aquaria for centuries?\" Kael asked, his voice low.\nSophia nodded. \"It's not what we thought. Someone hurt it, stole its light. We need to fix what was broken.\"\nTharros moved beside her, his golden eyes reflecting the dagger's glow. \"The abyss is no place for the unprepared. Even in my dragon form, I've never ventured this deep.\"\n\"We have no choice,\" Arin said, her dark robes swirling around her ankles. \"The corruption is spreading faster now. If we turn back, there won't be an Aquaria to save.\"\nWithout further debate, they dove into the opening. The water grew colder as they descended, pressing against their bodies with increasing force. Their bracelets' light seemed to shrink, as if the darkness was eating it away.\nAfter what felt like hours of swimming downward, the narrow tunnel opened up. Sophia gasped as they emerged onto the edge of a vast, flat plain stretching as far as their limited vision allowed.\n\"The Abyssal Plain,\" Tharros whispered, his voice tight with effort. \"Few have seen it and returned.\"\nHere, the pressure was almost unbearable. Sophia felt like giant hands were squeezing her chest. Even breathing took concentration. She noticed Tharros's form shimmering, his usually solid appearance becoming transparent at the edges.\n\"Are you okay?\" she asked him.\nHe grimaced. \"The dragon in me struggles here. Too much pressure, too little light.\"\nKael reached out to steady him. \"We need to move quickly then.\"\nThey pushed forward across the plain, their movements sluggish in the crushing depths. Strange creatures darted just outside their circle of light-some appeared ancient, with primitive features that belonged to a time long past, while others seemed almost mechanical, with glowing parts that pulsed with eerie rhythm.\n\"These beings,\" Arin said, studying a jellyfishlike creature with clockwork tentacles. \"They don't make sense. Some look like they're from the past, others from... somewhere else.\"\n\"Time works differently in the abyss,\" Tharros managed between labored breaths. \"The deepest places touch the oldest magic.\"\nThe dagger in Sophia's hand suddenly flared bright, then dimmed. The strange device began to vibrate, its metal growing warm against her palm. Tiny cracks appeared along the blade.\n\"It's breaking!\" she cried.\nBut instead of shattering, the dagger's form shifted. The metal seemed to melt and reform, the hilt curving to fit her hand perfectly. Symbols etched themselves along the blade, matching the markings on her skin. When the transformation finished, the weapon glowed brighter than before, pushing back the crushing darkness.\n\"Not breaking,\" Arin observed. \"Changing. Like you did when you first came to Aquaria.\"\nThe newly transformed dagger sent out a pulse of light that spread across the plain. In its wake, Sophia's soundsight revealed more of their surroundings. The abyssal floor wasn't just empty space-it was covered with patterns, massive symbols etched into the seabed itself.\n\"Look,\" she pointed. \"These markings are like the ones in the cave, but bigger. Much bigger.\"\nKael swam lower, tracing a curve that stretched for hundreds of feet. \"They're everywhere. The whole plain is covered.\"\n\"It's a map,\" Tharros realized, his voice stronger as the dagger's light seemed to stabilize his form. \"No, more than that. It's a record.\"\nAs they followed the patterns, the pull in Sophia's chest grew stronger. The dagger tugged her forward, leading them across the vast plain toward something in the distance.\n\"There,\" Arin pointed.\nRising from the abyssal floor were enormous structures that couldn't possibly be natural. Towering pillars and arches formed a city unlike anything they'd seen in Aquaria. The buildings appeared both ancient and impossibly advanced, with surfaces that rippled like living tissue yet held the precision of master craftsmanship.\n\"What is this place?\" Kael breathed, his warrior's confidence momentarily shaken.\nSophia's dagger pulsed in time with her heartbeat as they approached the strange city. \"I think... I think this is where it all began.\"\nThey swam toward the massive archway that marked the entrance. Strange symbols glowed as they approached, responding to their presence-or perhaps to the dagger in Sophia's hand.\n\"Wait,\" Tharros cautioned, grabbing her arm. \"Something's wrong.\"\nBefore Sophia could respond, the water around them began to vibrate. The sensation started as a gentle humming but quickly intensified until their teeth chattered and their vision blurred.\n\"What's happening?\" Kael shouted, drawing closer to protect Sophia.\nThe vibrations peaked, then suddenly stopped. In the eerie silence that followed, they noticed the water had grown unnaturally still, as if time itself had paused.\nA figure appeared in the archway-humanoid but clearly not human. Its skin shimmered with the same bioluminescence as the Leviathan's corrupted form, but this being's light was pure, untainted by darkness.\n\"The light returns,\" it said, its voice somehow clear despite the crushing depth. \"But you are not what we expected.\"\nThe figure's gaze fixed on Sophia, then on the dagger she held.\n\"You carry our key, yet you are not of our blood,\" it continued. \"How is this possible?\"\nBefore Sophia could answer, more figures emerged from the city, surrounding them in a circle of light. Each one studied them with ancient eyes that seemed to pierce through flesh and bone.\n\"They have followed the Wounded One,\" another voice said. \"They seek to heal what was broken.\"\n\"Impossible,\" a third replied. \"The light was taken by the surface dwellers. They cannot undo their ancestors' crime.\"\nSophia felt the others tense beside her. Kael's hand moved to a weapon at his belt, while Arin's fingers curled, dark energy gathering between them.\n\"Stop,\" Sophia commanded, surprising herself with the authority in her voice. She stepped forward, raising the dagger. \"We've come to restore balance, not to fight.\"\nThe figures paused, their attention focusing entirely on her. The leader moved closer, its face inches from Sophia's.\n\"You speak of balance, yet you know nothing of what was lost,\" it said. \"The Leviathan's light was not just taken-it was corrupted, twisted to serve the greed of those above. That corruption now spreads through all waters.\"\n\"Then show me how to fix it,\" Sophia challenged. \"That's why we're here.\"\nThe being's eyes narrowed. \"The healing requires sacrifice. Are you willing to pay that price, surface child?\"\nBefore Sophia could respond, Tharros pushed forward. \"She is no mere surface dweller. She is the light bearer, chosen by ancient magic older than even this place.\"\nThe figures murmured among themselves, their lights pulsing in patterns Sophia couldn't understand. Finally, the leader gestured toward the city.\n\"Then come,\" it said. \"See what your kind destroyed. Learn the truth of the abyss. Then we will know if you are worthy to attempt what none have accomplished in ten thousand years.\"\nAs they followed the strange beings toward the towering structures, Sophia felt a chill that had nothing to do with the cold water. The dagger throbbed in her hand like a second heartbeat, growing warmer with each step toward the city.\n\"I don't trust them,\" Kael whispered.\n\"Neither do I,\" Arin agreed. \"But we need their knowledge.\"\nTharros moved protectively closer to Sophia. \"Whatever happens, we face it together.\"\nSophia nodded, but her attention was fixed on the city ahead. Within those alien structures lay answers-and perhaps the key to saving Aquaria. But as they passed beneath the massive archway, the dagger suddenly blazed with blinding light, and Sophia felt something ancient and powerful reaching for her mind.\nThe truth of the abyss waited within, but Sophia wondered if they were prepared for what they would find.\nEchoes of the Lost\nThe blinding light from Sophia's dagger faded, leaving spots dancing in her vision. The ancient presence that had brushed against her mind retreated, but she could still feel it watching, waiting. When her sight cleared, she gasped.\nThey stood in a vast chamber where the walls, floor, and ceiling seemed alive. Surfaces pulsed with soft blue light that flowed like blood through veins. Massive crystal columns stretched upward, their surfaces etched with symbols similar to those on her skin. But strangest of all were the buildings-if they could even be called that. Structures rose and curved in impossible ways, part coral, part crystal, part living tissue.\n\"This isn't like anything in Aquaria,\" Arin whispered, her dark eyes wide with wonder.\nTheir strange guide gestured around them. \"This was Luminoth, first city of the deep. It stood when your kingdoms were nothing but dreams in the minds of surface dwellers.\"\nTharros moved forward, his golden eyes reflecting the pulsing lights. \"I've heard legends of a civilization before Aquaria, but they were dismissed as myths.\"\n\"Not myths,\" the being corrected. \"Memories your kind chose to forget.\"\nKael kept one hand on his weapon as they walked deeper into the city. \"How can buildings be alive?\"\n\"They aren't simply buildings,\" Sophia realized, touching a wall that felt warm beneath her fingers. \"They're a blend of architecture and biology. Someone figured out how to grow structures instead of building them.\"\nThe guide nodded. \"You see with clearer eyes than most. We called it living architecture-a harmony of crystal, coral, and consciousness.\"\nThey followed their guide through twisting corridors that seemed to shift subtly as they passed. Sophia noticed how the lights brightened around her, responding to her presence-or perhaps to the dagger she carried.\n\"Here,\" the guide said, stopping before a massive circular doorway. \"The Hall of Records. What you seek lies within.\"\nThe door spiraled open at their approach, revealing a chamber filled with crystal pillars that glowed from within. Each pillar contained swirling patterns that moved like living things.\n\"These are memory crystals,\" Tharros explained, his voice hushed with awe. \"I've seen smaller versions in the oldest parts of the palace, but never anything this size or complexity.\"\nSophia's dagger pulsed, drawing her toward a central pillar larger than the others. As she approached, images formed within the crystal-not just pictures, but threedimensional scenes playing out like a movie inside the translucent surface.\n\"It's showing us their history,\" she said.\nThe others gathered around, watching as the crystal revealed the story of Luminoth. They saw a thriving civilization of beings who commanded both science and magic with equal mastery. They witnessed the creation of wonders that made Aquaria's greatest achievements seem primitive by comparison.\nBut then the images darkened. Conflict appeared-battles between the depths and the surface. Terrible weapons unleashed destruction that threatened to tear apart the very fabric of the ocean.\n\"The War of Tides,\" their guide explained. \"When surface dwellers sought to claim the power of the deep for themselves.\"\nThe crystal showed the desperate creation of a magical barrier-a division between surface and sea magic. The Luminoth sacrificed much of their power to forge this barrier, using the essence of their greatest guardian, the Leviathan, to seal it.\n\"They created the barriers,\" Arin realized. \"The same ones that are failing now.\"\n\"Yes,\" the guide confirmed. \"The balance has held for ten thousand years, but the corruption spreads. The Leviathan's light was meant to maintain the barrier, not be imprisoned by it.\"\nThe images shifted to show a terrible betrayal-surface magicusers stealing something precious from the Leviathan, weakening both it and the barrier. In its pain and rage, the guardian began to change, its light dimming as darkness crept in.\n\"This is what we've been feeling,\" Tharros said. \"The barrier's collapse is allowing corrupted magic to seep through.\"\nKael frowned. \"But why now? What's changed after all this time?\"\nThe guide turned to Sophia. \"Ask the dagger. It knows.\"\nHeart racing, Sophia raised the weapon. The moment she did, the crystal pillars all around them flared to life, connecting to the dagger with beams of light. Knowledge flooded her mind-too much, too fast.\n\"The balance requires four powers,\" she gasped, struggling to process the information. \"Dragon, warrior, witch, and...\" She hesitated, looking at her own hands. \"Light bearer.\"\n\"Yes,\" the guide nodded. \"Every ten thousand years, the barrier must be renewed by these four powers combined. The last renewal failed when the surface dwellers interfered. Now you four must complete what was left undone.\"\nTharros stepped forward. \"How? Tell us what we need to do.\"\nThe guide pointed to a doorway at the far end of the chamber. \"The Renewal Chamber lies beyond. There, if you are truly worthy, you will find your answer.\"\nAs they moved toward the doorway, Sophia felt a growing unease. The dagger in her hand vibrated, warning of danger. She turned to alert the others just as the floor beneath them shuddered.\n\"Something's wrong,\" she called out.\nThin lines of light spread across the floor in complex patterns, racing between them. Before anyone could react, transparent barriers shot upward, separating all four of them.\n\"What is this?\" Kael shouted, striking the barrier with his fist. It held firm.\nTheir guide's expression remained calm. \"The final test has begun. The Renewal Chamber will only open to those who prove themselves worthy-separately.\"\n\"You said nothing about a test,\" Arin accused, dark energy swirling around her hands.\n\"I said the truth awaited you,\" the guide replied. \"This is part of that truth. Each of you must find your own path through the city's heart.\"\nThe floor beneath them began to move, carrying each in a different direction. Sophia pressed her hand against the barrier, watching helplessly as her friends were pulled away from her.\n\"Find the central chamber!\" Tharros called, his voice muffled through the wall. \"We'll meet there!\"\n\"Be careful!\" Sophia shouted back. \"The city is alive-it's watching us!\"\nAs her platform glided away, carrying her down a dimly lit corridor, Sophia clutched the dagger tighter. The light bearer, the guide had called her. But what exactly did that mean?\nThe platform stopped in a small chamber where all the lights had died. Only the glow from her dagger and bracelet illuminated the space. Strange shadows danced on the walls, taking shapes that seemed almost human before dissolving back into darkness.\n\"Hello?\" she called.\nA whisper answered-not from around her, but from within her mind.\nLight bearer, you carry what was stolen. But are you willing to return it?\n\"Return what?\" Sophia asked the empty room. \"The Leviathan's light? Isn't that why we're here?\"",

        "content": "Some gifts, once given, cannot be taken back.\nThe words sent a chill through her. Before she could respond, a doorway opened in the wall ahead, revealing a passage that hummed with power.\nSophia squared her shoulders and stepped forward. Whatever test this ancient city had planned for her, she would face it. Her friends were counting on her, and somewhere in this maze of living crystal and forgotten magic, they were facing challenges of their own.\nThe thought of Tharros, Kael, and Arin facing unknown dangers alone made her stomach twist with worry. But the pull in her chest urged her forward, toward a truth she was only beginning to understand.\nAs she stepped through the doorway, the passage sealed behind her. There was only one way to go now-deeper into the heart of a civilization that time had forgotten, but whose legacy threatened to destroy everything she had come to love.\nSomewhere ahead lay the answers they sought. And possibly, the greatest sacrifice they would ever be asked to make.\nThe Dragon Within\nTharros slammed his fist against the crystal barrier one last time before accepting that brute force wouldn't work. The translucent wall pulsed with energy that seemed to feed on his anger. He watched helplessly as Sophia, Kael, and Arin disappeared down separate corridors, each carried away by the living architecture of Luminoth.\n\"Ancient trickery,\" he growled, his golden eyes scanning the chamber he'd been deposited in.\nUnlike the grand hallways they'd passed through earlier, this room was small and hexagonal, with walls that shimmered like scales. As Tharros turned, examining his prison, the light changed subtly, following his movements.\n\"I know you're watching me,\" he called out. \"What is this test you think I need to pass?\"\nThe floor beneath him rippled in response. A panel slid open, revealing a passageway that glowed with faint blue light. With no other options, Tharros entered the tunnel, keeping one hand against the wall to steady himself.\nThe passage led to a vast circular arena. The ceiling arched high above, decorated with constellations Tharros had never seen before. The floor was a mosaic depicting ocean currents swirling around a central whirlpool.\n\"Dragon king,\" a voice echoed through the chamber, \"you who claim dominion over the waters.\"\nTharros spun around, searching for the source, but found only empty air. \"Show yourself!\"\n\"We are the Memory of Luminoth,\" the voice continued. \"And you are not ready.\"\nThe floor trembled. From the central whirlpool rose figures made of shimmering light and crystal-warriors wielding weapons that glowed with strange energy. They weren't solid, but neither were they mere illusions. Tharros recognized the danger immediately.\n\"Constructs,\" he muttered. \"Magic given form.\"\nThe first construct attacked without warning, swinging a blade made of pure energy. Tharros dodged and countered, calling on his dragon magic. Golden fire erupted from his hands, engulfing the nearest warrior.\nBut instead of destroying it, the fire was absorbed. The construct grew brighter, stronger.\n\"What?\" Tharros gasped as a second warrior struck him from behind, sending him sprawling across the floor.\n\"Dragon fire feeds us,\" the voice explained. \"Your magic is known to us, studied and countered long ago.\"\nMore constructs rose from the floor. Tharros shifted to his dragon form, scales erupting across his skin as his body elongated and grew. His massive tail swept several warriors aside, but for each one he knocked down, two more appeared.\nA net of energy caught his tail, sending pain shooting through his body. Another wrapped around one massive claw. The constructs were coordinating, trapping him piece by piece.\n\"You rely too much on power,\" the voice criticized. \"Is that all there is to dragonkind?\"\nTharros roared in defiance, straining against the energy bindings. But each struggle only tightened their hold. Pain clouded his thoughts as the constructs continued their relentless attack.\nIn a distant part of the city, Sophia paused in her own journey, a sharp pain lancing through her chest. She pressed a hand against the wall to steady herself.\n\"Tharros,\" she whispered, somehow knowing he was in danger.\nThe dagger in her hand pulsed in response to her concern. Through their bond, faint but growing stronger each day, she could feel his pain, his struggle.\n\"I need to help him,\" she said to the empty corridor.\nAs if responding to her wish, the wall before her transformed, becoming a window that looked out onto Tharros's battle. She watched in horror as the dragon king fought against overwhelming odds, his mighty form nearly covered in glowing restraints.\n\"He can't win that way,\" she realized. \"Not with force alone.\"\nSophia placed her hand on the window, the dagger in her grip glowing brighter. \"Tharros! Listen to me!\"\nIn the arena, Tharros heard Sophia's voice cutting through the chaos. He couldn't see her, but her words reached him nonetheless.\n\"They know dragon strength, but that's not all you are! Remember what you told Kael in the tunnel!\"\nThe memory flashed through his mind-the narrow passage that had taught them all that force wasn't always the answer. Sometimes, one had to yield to advance.\n\"Not strength alone, but strength with restraint,\" he remembered.\nThe constructs closed in, preparing a final attack. With nothing left to lose, Tharros did something no dragon king had done in centuries-he surrendered to his most primal nature.\nDragons weren't just fire and fury. The oldest of their kind had been liquid grace, adapting to their environment rather than dominating it. Somewhere in his ancient bloodline, that knowledge remained.\nTharros let his form dissolve. His solid body melted into flowing water and light, slipping through the energy nets like mist through fingers. The constructs struck at empty air as he reformed behind them, no longer fighting against the magic of Luminoth, but flowing with it.\n\"Yes,\" the voice approved. \"You begin to understand.\"\nMoving like water, Tharros danced between the constructs. Instead of trying to destroy them, he redirected their energy, letting their attacks flow past him or back into themselves. One by one, they dissolved, unable to combat this new strategy.\nWhen the last construct faded, Tharros stood alone in the center of the arena, breathing hard but unbound. His golden eyes glowed with newfound understanding.\n\"There is wisdom in yielding,\" he acknowledged.\n\"A lesson your ancestors once knew,\" the voice replied. \"Before pride made them forget.\"\nThe floor opened once more, revealing a new passage. This one led to a small chamber lined with crystal tablets that glowed with inner fire-dragon fire, preserved for millennia.\nTharros approached the nearest tablet. As his fingers touched its surface, images bloomed in his mind. He saw dragons-ancient, powerful, but different from any he'd known. These dragons worked alongside the people of Luminoth, using their magic not for dominance but for creation.\n\"We helped build the barriers,\" he whispered, moving from tablet to tablet, absorbing their knowledge. \"Dragons weren't just warriors-we were guardians, architects of the divide between worlds.\"\nThe final tablet showed a solemn ceremony. Four dragon kings, their scales shimmering with power, channeled their energy into a central pool where the Leviathan waited. Not as a monster, but as a willing vessel for their combined magic.\n\"The renewal ceremony,\" Tharros realized. \"It needs dragon magic. My magic.\"\n\"And not just any dragon,\" the voice confirmed. \"But one who understands balance.\"\nTharros turned, searching for the source of the voice. In the corner of the chamber stood a figure-not a construct, but a memory given form. An ancient dragon king in humanoid shape, his scales the color of dawn.\n\"You've carried the burden of kingship without understanding its true purpose,\" the figure said. \"Power without wisdom is merely force. Force alone cannot renew the barriers.\"\n\"I'm ready to learn,\" Tharros replied, bowing his head.\nThe figure nodded, approval in his ancient eyes. \"Then take this knowledge to your friends. Each must complete their trial before you can proceed to the Heart.\"\n\"Are they in danger?\" Tharros asked, thinking of Sophia, Kael, and Arin facing their own tests.\n\"All true growth comes through challenge,\" the figure answered. \"But through your bond, you can aid each other, as the light bearer aided you.\"\nTharros thought of Sophia's voice reaching him in his moment of need, giving him the key to victory when all seemed lost.\n\"Show me how to help them,\" he demanded.\nThe ancient king smiled. \"You already know how, Tharros of Aquaria. The question is: are you willing to share your power instead of hoarding it? For in the Heart, you must give away what you value most.\"\nBefore Tharros could ask what that meant, the figure dissolved into motes of light that swirled around him, seeping into his skin. Knowledge flooded his mind-ancient secrets of dragon magic that had been lost for generations.\nWith this new wisdom came a terrifying revelation: the true price of renewing the barriers.\n\"No,\" Tharros whispered, his heart heavy with understanding. \"There must be another way.\"\nBut deep down, he knew there wasn't. And somewhere in this forgotten city, Sophia was moving closer to the same terrible truth.\n The Truth Between Worlds\nTharros moved through the winding corridors of Luminoth, his mind heavy with the ancient information he'd absorbed. Golden light flickered from his fingertips, illuminating his path as he followed the pull that linked him to Sophia.",

        "content": "Around a sharp turn, he nearly collided with a figure rushing from the opposite direction.\n\"Tharros!\" Sophia cried, throwing herself into his arms.\nHe held her tight, feeling the rapid beat of her heart against his chest. \"You're safe,\" he breathed.\n\"I was so worried.\" She pulled back to examine him. \"After I saw you fighting those creatures...\"\n\"Your voice guided me,\" he said. \"You helped me remember what I'd forgotten.\"\nFootsteps echoed behind them. Kael emerged from a darkened tunnel, his silver armor scratched and dented. His normally perfect hair was disheveled, but his eyes burned with newfound intensity.\n\"The sea witch isn't far behind,\" he stated, clasping Tharros's forearm in greeting. \"Her trial involved puzzles. Mine was battle, but not the kind I expected.\"\n\"What happened?\" Sophia asked.\nKael's face darkened. \"I had to fight myself-or rather, the worst version of myself. The one who puts job before compassion.\"\nBefore anyone could reply, Arin appeared. Her robes were untorn, but her face showed tiredness. Dark rings shadowed her eyes.\n\"Did you know?\" she asked, staring at Tharros. \"About the price?\"\nTharros nodded slowly. \"I just learned. The old knowledge-\"\n\"What price?\" Sophia interrupted, looking between them.\nArin opened her mouth to answer but suddenly froze. The air around them shimmered, and the walls began to melt away. The corridor changed into a vast circular chamber with a domed ceiling that mirrored the night sky.\nIn the middle stood a figure that seemed carved from pure crystal. It had a humanoid shape but no distinct traits except for eyes that glowed with inner light. When it spoke, its voice echoed through their bones rather than their ears.\n\"The Four have arrived,\" it declared. \"The Dragon, the Light Bearer, the Warrior, and the Witch.\"\n\"Who are you?\" Kael demanded, hand reflexively reaching for his weapon.\n\"I am Veritax, Guardian of Truth,\" the crystal being replied. \"None may pass to the Heart without facing me.\"\n\"Another test?\" Arin asked wearily.\n\"Not a test of strength or skill,\" Veritax said. \"But of truth. The Heart responds only to those who come with honest motives. Deception weakens the walls between worlds.\"\nThe floor beneath them shifted, making four seats arranged in a circle. At Veritax's move, they each sat down.\n\"I will ask questions,\" the guardian explained. \"Answer truthfully or stay silent. Lies will be punished.\"\nAs if to show, the crystal of its body pulsed with blinding light.\n\"First question: Why do you seek the Heart of Luminoth?\"\n\"To renew the barriers,\" Tharros answered quickly. \"The divide between worlds is failing.\"\nVeritax turned to Sophia. \"And you, Light Bearer?\"\nSophia paused. \"To help my friends. To protect both worlds.\" She stopped, then added, \"And to understand who I truly am.\"\nThe guardian nodded, seeming pleased. \"The Warrior?\"\nKael straightened. \"To fulfill my duty to Aquaria.\"\n\"Not the whole truth,\" Veritax noted. The crystal of its body dulled slightly. \"Try again.\"\nKael's jaw clenched. \"To protect those I care about. To ensure neither world is destroyed by what lies between them.\"\n\"And?\" the guardian pressed.\n\"And to prove I'm more than just my bloodline,\" Kael admitted, his voice barely audible.\nThe crystal brightened. \"The Witch?\"\nArin lifted her chin. \"To right an ancient wrong.\"\n\"Whose wrong?\" Veritax asked.\n\"Mine,\" she whispered. \"From another life.\"\nSophia gasped, but Arin refused to meet her eyes.\n\"Second question,\" Veritax continued. \"What binds you together?\"\n\"Fate,\" Tharros answered.\n\"Circumstance,\" said Kael.\n\"Choice,\" Sophia added.\n\"Necessity,\" Arin decided.\nThe guardian's crystal body shimmered. \"All true, yet none complete. Third question: What are you willing to sacrifice for each other?\"\nSilence fell over the room. Sophia looked at her friends, seeing the same fear reflected in their eyes that she felt in her heart.\n\"Everything,\" she finally said.\nTharros reached over and took her hand. \"My power,\" he answered.\n\"My future,\" Kael said quietly.\nArin looked away. \"My redemption.\"\nVeritax's light pulsed. \"Final question: Do you understand what awaits in the Heart?\"\n\"Death,\" Tharros said simply.\nSophia's hand tightened around his. \"What? No!\"\n\"Not death,\" Arin amended. \"Transformation. One must become the vessel for the barrier's magic.\"\n\"Like the Leviathan,\" Kael realized, his eyes widening.\n\"Yes,\" Veritax verified. \"Before corruption, the Leviathan was guardian, keeper of the barriers, willingly bound to service.\"\n\"But something went wrong,\" Sophia guessed.\n\"The vessel was unwilling,\" the guardian explained. \"Forced rather than chosen. Resentment grew to corruption over ages.\"\nTharros stood. \"I will be the vessel.\"\n\"No!\" Three voices protested simultaneously.\n\"It must be me,\" Kael insisted. \"I have the least to lose.\"\n\"You're wrong,\" Arin replied. \"This is my penance to pay.\"\n\"Stop!\" Sophia shouted, rising to her feet. \"None of you gets to decide alone. This affects all of us.\"\nVeritax watched their exchange with glowing eyes. \"The Light Bearer speaks knowledge. The freedom belongs to all. But know this: whoever becomes the vessel stays conscious, separate yet bound. Neither dead nor fully living. Existing between worlds.\"\n\"For how long?\" Sophia asked.\n\"Until the next renewal,\" the guardian answered. \"Centuries, perhaps.\"\nHeavy silence fell upon the group. Sophia felt the weight of impossibility crushing her chest. How could they possibly choose? How could any of them bear to lose one of their own?\n\"Is there no other way?\" she begged.\n\"There is always another way,\" Veritax said. \"But every path has its cost.\"\nThe crystal being's form began to dissolve, particles of light drifting toward the center of the chamber, showing a doorway beyond.\n\"You have passed the Trial of Truth,\" its voice repeated as it faded. \"Your hearts are known to Luminoth. The way to the Heart is open.\"\nAs the guardian disappeared entirely, the four companions stood facing the doorway and the impossible decision that lay beyond.\n\"I won't let any of you sacrifice yourself,\" Sophia vowed.\nTharros touched her face gently. \"Sometimes there isn't a perfect solution.\"\n\"Then we'll find an imperfect one,\" she declared. \"Together.\"\nKael nodded. \"Together.\"\nArin stayed silent, her eyes fixed on the doorway, a strange resolve hardening her features.\n\"What aren't you telling us?\" Sophia asked her.\nBefore Arin could answer, a deep rumble shook the room. Cracks formed in the floor, spreading outward from the doorway.\n\"The barriers weaken even as we debate,\" Tharros warned. \"We must decide quickly.\"\n\"Then let's go,\" Sophia said, moving toward the doorway. \"The answer will be in the Heart. It has to be.\"\nAs they crossed the threshold together, none of them noticed the shadow that slipped in behind them-a darkness that had been following them since they entered Luminoth, waiting for precisely this moment.\nThe moment when truth gave way to choice, and choice to fate.\n Where Light Ends\nThe opening led them into a long tunnel that sloped gently downward. Crystal formations jutted from the walls, throwing rainbow reflections across their faces as they walked in silence. Each step took them deeper into Luminoth's heart, and closer to a decision none of them wanted to make.\n\"I can feel it,\" Sophia whispered, breaking the heavy quiet. \"Something massive... waiting.\"\nTharros nodded, his golden eyes glinting in the dim light. \"The Heart of Luminoth. The center of all barrier magic.\"\n\"And our doom,\" Arin muttered, trailing behind.\nKael shot her a sharp look. \"We don't know that yet.\"\n\"Don't we?\" she challenged. \"You heard Veritax. Someone must become the vessel.\"\nSophia increased her pace, moving ahead of the group. Her dagger pulsed with soft blue light, responding to her feelings. \"I refuse to accept that. There's always another way.\"\nThe tunnel widened suddenly, opening into a huge cavern that stole their breath. They stood on a narrow ledge overlooking an abyss so deep that even their improved vision couldn't penetrate its darkness. The walls of the tunnel were lined with the same crystalline material they'd seen throughout Luminoth, but here it glowed with inner fire, pulsing like a heartbeat.\nAnd it was a heart-the entire room resembled a massive, crystalline heart, with veins of light stretching up the walls and across the roof.\n\"The Abyssal Trench,\" Tharros breathed, his voice filled with awe. \"Not just a geographical feature, but the space between worlds.\"\nSophia knelt at the edge, looking into the darkness. \"How far down does it go?\"\n\"Beyond measurement,\" Arin said, joining her. \"The bottom exists in neither our world nor any other. It's the space between.\"\nKael pulled a small object from his armor-a silver sphere that glowed with runes. He activated it, and a holographic display appeared above his palm, showing energy levels.\n\"The power coming from below...\" he shook his head in disbelief. \"It's off the scale. More energy than all of Aquaria's magical sources combined.\"\n\"The barrier magic,\" Tharros explained. \"It's been contained here since the first dragons and the ancient ones created the divide between worlds.\"\nA cold wind gusted up from the abyss, bringing whispers that sounded almost like voices. Sophia shivered, wrapping her arms around herself.\n\"How do we get down there?\" she asked.\nIn answer, Tharros stepped to the edge. He raised his hands, and golden light flowed from his fingertips, making a staircase that spiraled down into the darkness.\n\"Dragon magic,\" he explained. \"The knowledge I gained in my trial.\"\nKael tested the first step with his boot. It held firm despite looking to be made of light. \"Impressive,\" he admitted.\n\"It won't last long,\" Tharros warned. \"The abyss absorbs magic. We must move quickly.\"\nAs if to confirm his words, the bottom steps of the staircase were already starting to fade, eaten away by the darkness below.\n\"Wait,\" Sophia said, grabbing Tharros's arm. \"Before we go down... we need a plan. We can't just walk into whatever's waiting and hope for the best.\"\n\"She's right,\" Kael agreed. \"If the barriers need renewing and one of us must become the vessel... we should decide now who it will be.\"\n\"I already told you-\" Tharros began.\n\"And I told you no,\" Sophia cut him off. \"None of you is sacrificing yourself.\"\nArin had been particularly quiet, staring into the abyss with a strange expression. Now she turned to face them.\n\"There is another possibility,\" she said softly. \"Something I learned during my trial, something I've suspected since we began this journey.\"\nAll eyes turned to her.\n\"What if none of us needs to become the vessel permanently?\" she asked. \"What if we could share the burden? Take turns?\"\nHope flared in Sophia's eyes. \"Is that possible?\"\n\"In theory,\" Arin said carefully. \"It would take perfect harmony between our magic. A bond stronger than any that's existed before.\"\n\"Our bond is already unlike any other,\" Tharros pointed out.\nKael's brow wrinkled in thought. \"A rotation... one of us maintaining the barriers while the others live their lives, then switching after a time.\" He nodded slowly. \"It could work.\"\n\"It's never been done,\" Arin warned. \"And it would still mean separation, just not forever.\"\nThe golden stairs flickered, more steps disappearing into the darkness.\n\"We're running out of time,\" Tharros said sadly. \"Whatever we decide, we must do it now.\"\nSophia looked at each of them in turn-her three partners, each bound to her in different ways. \"Then let's try Arin's way. Let's strengthen our bond before we fall.\"\nThey made a circle at the edge of the abyss, joining hands. Tharros's eyes glowed golden as he channeled his dragon power. Fire exploded around their joined hands, but it didn't burn.\n\"My strength is yours,\" he promised.\nKael's silver armor gleamed as his warrior magic activated, making a protective aura that enveloped them all.\n\"My shield is yours,\" he swore.\nArin's dark powers materialized as swirling shadows that intertwined with the golden fire and silver light.\n\"My wisdom is yours,\" she promised.\nSophia closed her eyes, feeling their energies flow through her, mingling with her own growing hydrokinetic powers. Water spiraled up from the depths, wrapping around their joined magic like a live ribbon.\n\"My heart is yours,\" she whispered.\nThe united energies pulsed once, twice, then coalesced into a shimmering barrier around them all. Within that sphere, Sophia could feel each of them-Tharros's fierce purpose, Kael's steadfast loyalty, Arin's ancient sorrow. And they could feel her-her hope, her fear, her love for each of them.\n\"It's working,\" Kael said in wonder. \"I can feel all of you.\"\n\"This is what the prophecy meant,\" Arin realized. \"Not just four powers united, but four souls.\"\nTharros squeezed Sophia's hand. \"With this bond, perhaps we can indeed share the burden of the vessel.\"\nThe staircase had now dissolved halfway down, but their newfound link gave them courage.\n\"Let's go,\" Sophia said, leading them toward the first step. \"Together.\"\nThey descended the spiral stairs, their magical barrier illuminating the darkness around them. With each step, the pressure increased, the power of the abyss pushing against their shield. But their combined power held fast.",

        "content": "As they went deeper, strange images flickered at the edge of Sophia's awareness-glimpses of other worlds, other realities brushing against their own. The boundary between dimensions grew thinner the further they fell.\n\"I can sense the Heart,\" Tharros said, his voice strained from maintaining the staircase. \"It's calling to us.\"\n\"I hear it too,\" Sophia responded. Though there was no real sound, she could feel a pull, a rhythmic pulse calling her downward.\nThe stairs finally gave out fully, leaving them hovering in darkness so complete it seemed solid. Only their barrier supplied light, a small bubble of reality in an ocean of nothingness.\n\"Now what?\" Kael asked, looking down at the endless drop.\nSophia closed her eyes, focusing on the strange new senses that had woken within her since coming to Aquaria. The water that had risen to join their magical barrier reacted to her will, expanding outward, feeling for currents in the darkness.\n\"There,\" she said, pointing to what looked to be empty space. \"I can feel a passage.\"\n\"I see nothing,\" Kael revealed.\n\"Trust her,\" Tharros encouraged. \"The Light Bearer's senses are attuned to spaces between worlds.\"\nWith Sophia leading them, they moved through the darkness, their barrier the only light in an endless void. Minutes stretched into what felt like hours as they managed invisible currents, moving ever deeper.\nThen suddenly, far below, a speck of light appeared.\n\"The Heart,\" Arin whispered. \"We're almost there.\"\nAs they drew closer, the pinpoint expanded, showing a chamber that glowed with pulsing energy. Within it stood a crystalline structure that resembled a throne, surrounded by swirling patterns of light that formed and remade in endless complexity.\n\"The center of all barriers,\" Tharros stated. \"Where the worlds were first divided.\"\nThey were only moments away from reaching it when Sophia felt something brush against their barrier-something cold and ancient and hungry.\n\"We're not alone,\" she warned, her heart racing.\nThe shadow that had followed them through Luminoth now showed itself, spreading across their magical shield like ink in water. Where it touched, their barrier began to crumble.\n\"The corruption!\" Kael yelled, drawing his weapon.\n\"No,\" Arin countered, her face pale with recognition. \"Something worse.\"\nThe shadow coalesced into a roughly humanoid shape, its features shifting and changing like smoke. But its eyes remained constant-endless pits of darkness that seemed to eat light.\n\"The Void Walker,\" Tharros growled. \"Guardian of the spaces between.\"\n\"Unwelcome visitors,\" the entity whispered, its voice like ice cracking. \"Or perhaps... sacrifices?\"\nTheir barrier continued to weaken under its touch, darkness seeping in. They were caught between the Void Walker and the Heart, with nowhere to escape.\n\"What do we do?\" Sophia asked, struggling to keep her part of the failing shield.\nTharros met her stare, his expression grim but determined.\n\"We walk into the Heart,\" he said simply. \"Now.\"\nWithout waiting for agreement, he pulled Sophia forward, trusting Kael and Arin to follow. The Void Walker reached for them with shadowy tendrils, but they were already falling, plunging toward the glowing room below.\nAs they fell, their barrier collapsed fully, leaving them exposed to whatever awaited them in the Heart of Luminoth.\n Secrets in the Black\nThey fell through darkness, spinning without direction or control. Sophia reached for Tharros, their fingers barely touching before being torn apart by unknown currents. The last remains of their protective shield scattered like stardust around them.\n\"Hold on to something!\" Kael yelled, his voice strangely muffled in the thick darkness.\n\"There's nothing to hold!\" Arin called back, her form now just a dim shape.\nSophia tumbled through the void, fear rising in her chest. Then something strange happened-the darkness began to feel... different. Not empty, but full. Not cold, but alive with action. It pressed against her skin like water, but thicker, more solid.\nOn reflex, she spread her arms and legs, as if swimming. The darkness responded, her fall slowing.\n\"It's like liquid!\" she called to the others. \"Swim!\"\nShe saw Tharros's golden eyes flash as he followed her lead, his strong strokes bringing him closer. Kael and Arin adjusted their moves too, fighting against the strange resistance.\nAs they regained control, Sophia noticed something even stranger-patterns in the darkness. Not visible patterns, but flows and currents she could somehow feel. Like reading braille with her full body.\n\"I can feel... information,\" she said, her voice hushed with wonder. \"The darkness is talking.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Tharros asked, now beside her.\nSophia focused on the sensations flowing over her skin. \"It's like... history. Memories stored in the currents.\"\nArin swam closer, her face intense. \"The Void holds the memories of all worlds. Few can read them.\"\n\"What do you see?\" Kael asked, keeping watch for the Void Walker that had attacked them.\nSophia closed her eyes, letting the designs wash through her. Images bloomed in her mind-ancient scenes from the dawn of seas.\n\"I see... the first dragons,\" she whispered. \"Swimming in seas that hadn't yet split from land. The world was whole then.\"\nThe darkness increased around them, almost like fog. Shapes began to form-not solid, but defined enough to make out. The darkness itself was creating images, reacting to Sophia's ability to read it.\n\"Look,\" Tharros breathed.\nAround them, the past of the oceans played out in shifting shadows. First dragons, their scales sparkling even in these phantom shapes. Ancient mer-people making coral cities. Sea witches channeling power through crystal staves.\n\"The original harmony,\" Arin recognized. \"Before the barriers.\"\nThe scenes changed, showing conflict-warfare between sea and land, magical explosions that tore reality itself.\n\"The First Sundering,\" Tharros named it. \"When my ancestors helped create the barriers to separate the worlds.\"\nNew shapes formed in the living darkness-four figures channeling power into a center point. A fifth figure emerged from that power, huge and serpentine.\n\"The first Leviathan,\" Sophia realized. \"It wasn't a monster. It was made as a guardian.\"\n\"A willing vessel,\" Kael added, remembering Veritax's words.\nAs they watched, the shadow Leviathan changed, evil creeping through its form like veins of corruption.\n\"Something went wrong,\" Tharros said quietly.\nThe pictures faded, leaving them floating in darkness once more. But Sophia could still feel the currents of information moving around her, guiding her.\n\"This way,\" she said with certainty, pointing lower and to the left. \"I can feel the path.\"\nThey swam through the thick darkness, following Sophia's direction. The pressure rose the deeper they went, squeezing against them like a giant fist.\n\"We need protection,\" Arin warned. \"This depth will crush even us.\"\nTharros nodded. \"Let's try the barrier again.\"\nThey reached for each other, making a circle as they continued to swim. This time, when they focused their combined power, something different happened. The darkness itself reacted, weaving into their magic like a willing partner.\nA new shield formed around them-not pushing the darkness away, but working with it.\n\"It's helping us,\" Sophia mused.\n\"Or using us,\" Arin replied, her expression wary.\nAs they fell further, strange creatures began to appear in the gloom. Unlike the shadow images they'd seen before, these were real-living beings that had adapted to the crushing darkness of the ditch.\nFish with transparent bodies and huge eyes that gave off their own faint light. Jellied creatures that pulsed with slow, deliberate moves. And stranger beings that baffled description-part plant, part animal, part living shadow.\n\"Life finds a way,\" Sophia whispered, her scientist's heart filled with wonder. \"Even here, between worlds.\"\nOne creature in particular caught her attention-a swirling mass of darkness with dozens of tentacles that reached out as they passed. Unlike the others, it seemed aware of them.\n\"Don't touch it,\" Kael warned, drawing his weapon.\nBut Sophia felt no threat from the thing. \"Wait,\" she said, putting out her hand toward one questing tendril.\n\"Sophia, no!\" Tharros lunged to stop her, but too late.\nThe tendril brushed against her fingers. Instead of danger, Sophia felt a rush of information-not words, but ideas, flooding into her mind.\n\"It's communicating,\" she gasped. \"It's... curious about us.\"\nMore tendrils reached toward them, not fiercely but with an alien sort of interest. Where they touched their barrier, they left whirling patterns like writing in an unknown language.\n\"What are they?\" Kael asked, dropping his weapon slightly.\n\"Void Dancers,\" Arin answered, recognition coming on her face. \"Guardians of the deep places. I thought they were lies.\"\nThe creature-the Void Dancer-continued its strange contact with Sophia. In her mind, she saw flashes of the Heart they sought, and something else-something huge stirring far below.\n\"It's warning us,\" she explained. \"The Leviathan is waking. It senses our approach.\"\nThe Void Dancer suddenly withdrew its tentacles, spinning faster before shooting away into the darkness. Other creatures followed, running in all directions.\n\"That can't be good,\" Kael mumbled.\nA deep vibration shook the water around them, so strong they could feel it in their bones. Their barrier flickered under the attack.\n\"We need to move faster,\" Tharros urged.\n\"This way,\" Sophia said, pointing toward the source of the sound. \"The Heart is there-I can feel it.\"\nThey swam harder, fighting against currents that suddenly seemed determined to push them back. The darkness grew even thicker, if that was possible, pressing against their barrier like a live thing trying to get in.\n\"It doesn't want us to reach the Heart,\" Arin realized.\n\"Or something doesn't,\" Kael amended.\nAnother jolt, stronger than the first, rippled through the deep. This time, they could hear something within it-a sound so low it was more felt than heard. A voice, ancient and cold.\n\"WHO DARES?\" it rumbled through the darkness.\nTharros's eyes widened. \"The Leviathan.\"\nThe vibrations increased, focusing on their small group. Their barrier started to crack under the pressure.\n\"I can't hold it!\" Arin cried, strain obvious on her face as she poured more power into their protection.\n\"Neither can I,\" Kael admitted, his silver power flickering.\nSophia felt their shield fading, darkness seeping through the cracks. But within that darkness, she could still read patterns-and now she understood what they meant.\n\"It's afraid,\" she realized. \"The Leviathan is afraid of us.\"\n\"Why would it fear us?\" Tharros asked.\n\"Because we can free it,\" Sophia answered, realization dawning. \"It was corrupted, yes-but it's also stuck. Bound to a job it never chose.\"\nThe pressure against their barrier suddenly eased, as if the darkness was considering her words.\n\"Is that true?\" Tharros asked Arin. \"Could the renewal ceremony free the current Leviathan rather than creating a new one?\"\nArin paused. \"Possibly. The texts never stated. They only said a willing vessel was needed.\"\nThe darkness parted before them, showing a pulsing light below-not bright, but distinct against the absolute black. The Heart of Luminoth, the center of barrier magic, the source of the Leviathan's power.\n\"We're here,\" Sophia whispered.\nAs they approached, the pulsing light showed a massive chamber. Crystalline structures rose from the floor and hung from the roof like giant teeth. In the middle floated a swirling vortex of energy-blues, purples, and blacks mixing together in hypnotic patterns.\nBut what made them gasp wasn't the Heart itself, but what surrounded it. A massive serpentine form encircled the room, its scaled body so vast they could only see parts of it at once. Where scales had once shimmered with protective magic, now evil flowed like oil, corrupting what had once been pure.\nThe Leviathan's enormous head turned toward them, eyes like twin abysses focused on their small group. Its mouth opened, showing endless rows of teeth that glowed with the same energy as the Heart.\n\"WHY HAVE YOU COME?\" its voice shook the room.\nBefore anyone could answer, a familiar shadow materialized beside the Leviathan-the Void Walker, its formless body now taking on a more solid look.\n\"They come to replace you, Great One,\" the Void Walker said, its voice like ice cracking. \"To bind another to eternal servitude while you are destroyed.\"\nThe Leviathan's huge body tensed, darkness flowing faster through its corrupted scales.\n\"No!\" Sophia shouted. \"That's not why we're here!\"\nBut the Leviathan was already moving, its huge tail sweeping toward them with the force of an underwater avalanche.\nTheir barrier broke totally as darkness and light collided, and the four companions were thrown in different directions, separated in the chaos.\nThe last thing Sophia saw before awareness faded was Tharros reaching desperately for her, his golden eyes wide with fear as darkness swallowed them both.\n Whispers in the Dark\nSophia woke to complete darkness. Her head throbbed as she tried to remember what had happened. The Leviathan's tail had hit their protection barrier, and then... nothing.\n\"Tharros?\" she called out, her voice small in the great emptiness. \"Kael? Arin?\"\nNo answer came back. She was alone.\nPanic bubbled up in her chest, but she pushed it down. Panicking wouldn't help. She closed her eyes-not that it made any difference in this darkness-and focused on the currents around her. The strange liquid darkness still flowed with information, with memories and words of the past.\nShe could use this. She could find the others.\nSophia spread her arms and began to swim, letting her newfound senses guide her. The darkness seemed less threatening now that she understood it was alive with knowledge. It wasn't trying to harm her-it was trying to connect.\n\"Show me my friends,\" she whispered to the void.\nThe currents changed around her, and she felt a gentle pull to her right. She followed it, swimming steadily through the thick darkness. As she moved, she became aware of a faint glow in the distance. Not the pulsing energy of the Heart, but something smaller, more recognizable.\nGolden eyes.\n\"Tharros!\" she cried, swimming faster.\nThe dragon king turned at the sound of her voice, relief washing over his face as she came into view. \"Sophia! Are you hurt?\"\nShe shook her head as she reached him, throwing her arms around his neck. \"I'm okay. Just lost.\"\nHis arms closed around her, and she felt his heartbeat-strong and steady against her chest. \"I thought I'd lost you,\" he whispered into her hair.\nA shimmering light emerged nearby, and they turned to see Kael swimming toward them, his silver magic lighting the darkness around him.\n\"Thank the depths,\" he said, his normally stoic face breaking into a rare smile. \"I've been searching everywhere.\"\n\"Have you found Arin?\" Sophia asked, looking past him.\nKael's smile faded. \"No. I thought she might be with you.\"\nA chill that had nothing to do with the cold darkness ran down Sophia's spine. \"We need to find her. Now.\"\nThey joined hands, and Sophia closed her eyes again, reaching out to the currents around them. \"Show us Arin,\" she ordered the darkness.\nThis time, the pull was stronger, more intense. They swam together, following Sophia's direction through the endless black. As they moved deeper, Sophia noticed something strange-whispers that weren't part of the information flow. Actual voices, saying words she couldn't quite catch.\n\"Do you hear that?\" she asked.\nTharros frowned. \"Hear what?\"\n\"Voices. Whispering.\"\nKael's grip on her hand tightened. \"I don't hear anything, Sophia.\"\nThat worried her more than if they had heard it too. If only she could hear the words, what did that mean?\nThe glow of the Heart appeared again in the distance, pulsing with its fascinating blue-purple-black energy. But it wasn't just the Heart she saw. A small figure floated before it, arms spread.\n\"Arin!\" Sophia called.\nThe sea witch didn't turn. She seemed frozen in place, looking at something they couldn't see.\nThey swam faster, but as they got closer, Sophia felt resistance pushing against them-like swimming against a strong current. The Leviathan was nowhere to be seen, but its presence lingered in the chamber, a crushing weight of ancient strength.\n\"Something's wrong,\" Tharros growled, his eyes fixed on Arin's lifeless form.\nAs they drew nearer, Sophia saw what had caught Arin's attention. Floating before her was a shard of crystal, black as the void around them but somehow darker still, as if it swallowed the little light that reached it. It pulsed with the same beat as the Heart, but its energy felt wrong-corrupted and twisted.\n\"Arin, get away from that!\" Kael shouted.\nArin finally turned, and Sophia gasped. Her eyes were faraway, unfocused, as if she was listening to something only she could hear.\n\"Can't you hear it?\" Arin whispered, her voice dreamy and far away. \"It's calling to me.\"\n\"What's calling to you?\" Sophia asked, trying to push closer despite the invisible force keeping them back.\n\"The power,\" Arin said, turning back to the crystal shard. \"Ancient magic. Magic from before the walls. Magic strong enough to save us all.\"\nThe whispers Sophia had heard grew louder, and now she could make out words: Power. Freedom. Control. Take it. It's yours.\n\"Don't listen to it, Arin!\" Sophia cried. \"It's the Leviathan trying to trick you!\"\nBut Arin wasn't listening. Her hand reached out toward the shard, fingers just inches away.\n\"Arin, stop!\" Tharros ordered, his voice carrying the full weight of his authority as king.\nFor a moment, Arin paused. Her hand trembled in midair as she fought against the pull of the shard.\n\"Please,\" Sophia begged. \"Whatever it's promising you, it's not worth it.\"\nArin's eyes cleared slightly. \"You don't understand,\" she said, her voice shaking. \"This power could change everything. We wouldn't need the repeat ceremony. We wouldn't need to bind another being to endless servitude.\"\n\"There's another way,\" Sophia urged. \"The Leviathan can be freed, not replaced. We can break the cycle, Arin!\"\nDoubt flashed across Arin's face. \"Can we really?\"\n\"Yes,\" Sophia said with all the conviction she could manage. \"Together. All four of us.\"\nArin's hand dropped slightly. The whispers grew more wild, more desperate. They'll betray you. They always do. Take the power for yourself. Save yourself. \"I've been alone for so long,\" Arin whispered, so quietly Sophia almost didn't hear it.\n\"You're not alone anymore,\" Kael said strongly. \"You have us.\"\nA tear slipped down Arin's face, glowing faintly in the darkness. \"I want to believe that.\"\n\"Then believe it,\" Tharros said, his voice softer than Sophia had ever heard it. \"Come back to us, Arin.\"\nFor one long moment, Sophia thought they'd gotten through to her. Arin's hand began to withdraw, her body turning toward them.\nThen the water around them shook violently. The Leviathan's roar echoed through the chamber, though the beast itself stayed hidden. The unseen force holding them back suddenly increased tenfold, pushing them away from Arin.\n\"No!\" Sophia screamed, reaching out frantically.\nBut it was too late. Arin's body jerked backward, as if pulled by invisible ropes. Her back arched, her face twisted in pain-or was it pleasure? Her hand closed around the crystal shard.\nLight burst from the point of contact, not the warm light of Arin's magic but something cold and alien. It crawled up her arm like lines of black fire, spreading across her body.\n\"ARIN!\" they screamed in unison, fighting against the force pushing them away.\nWhen the light faded, Arin floated motionless before them. Slowly, she turned, and Sophia felt her blood freeze in her veins.\nArin's eyes had changed. The warm amber was gone, replaced by whirling abysses of black and purple-the same eyes as the Leviathan.\nA smile spread across her face, terrible and beautiful. \"I understand now,\" she said, her voice layered with something old and other. \"I see everything.\"\nShe raised her hand, and the darkness around them reacted, swirling and thickening into a wall that pushed them further away.\n\"Arin, fight it!\" Sophia begged.\nBut Arin only smiled wider. \"Why would I fight what I've always been?\" she asked. \"The evil has always been inside me. Now I've simply accepted it.\"\nWith a flick of her hand, the currents around them turned violent, spinning them away from her and the Heart. The last thing Sophia saw before darkness claimed her again was Arin turning back to the pulsing Heart, her hand-now glowing with evil power-reaching out to claim it.\nShadows Within\nThe swirling currents finally freed Sophia, Tharros, and Kael, sending them tumbling through the darkness. Sophia's back hit something solid-a wall of crystal that glowed softly with blue light.\n\"Is everyone okay?\" she asked, pushing herself upright.\n\"Barely,\" Kael groaned, his silver power flickering weakly around him. \"That was no ordinary current.\"\nTharros moved to Sophia's side, his golden eyes scanning the surroundings. \"We're in some kind of tube. The Heart chamber must be connected to a network of passageways.\"\nSophia pressed her hand against the crystal wall. It hummed beneath her touch, almost like it was living. \"We have to go back for Arin.\"\n\"How?\" Kael asked. \"You saw what happened. Whatever that crystal shard was, it's changed her.\"\n\"I don't care,\" Sophia said strongly. \"We're not leaving her behind.\"\nTharros nodded. \"Agreed. But we need a plan. Rushing back in blindly won't help anyone.\"\nA faraway sound echoed through the tunnel-part scream, part roar. It made Sophia's skin prickle with fear.\n\"Arin,\" she whispered.\nWithout another word, they began swimming back toward the Heart chamber, led by the pulsing energy they could still feel even from a distance. The crystal walls around them grew darker as they approached, black lines spreading across the once-pristine blue surface.\n\"Look at the walls,\" Kael said quietly. \"It's like they're getting sick.\"\nSophia realized he was right. The darkness spreading through the crystals looked exactly like an infection-or rot. Just like what had happened to Arin.\nWhen they finally reached the entrance to the Heart chamber, they stopped, hidden behind a large crystal formation. The scene before them made Sophia's breath catch.\nArin floated in the middle of the chamber, surrounded by a sphere of pulsing dark energy. Her body had changed. Black lines ran beneath her skin, glowing with purple light. Her hair floated around her head like limbs, moving with a life of its own. The crystal shard was now buried in her chest, right over her heart.\nThe Leviathan circled her, its huge body coiled in a protective spiral. Its eyes-the same swirling darkness that now filled Arin's-watched her with something like pride.\n\"What do we do?\" Sophia whispered.\nTharros's face was grim. \"I don't know. I've never seen evil like this.\"\n\"Look,\" Kael pointed to the Heart. \"It's changing too.\"\nThe whirling vortex of energy that made up the Heart of Luminoth was different. Threads of pure darkness had started to weave through the blue and purple, like ink dropped in water.\n\"If the Heart becomes fully corrupted...\" Tharros didn't finish the sentence. He didn't have to.\n\"We have to get to Arin,\" Sophia said. \"If we can remove that shard, maybe we can save her.\"\n\"And how do you suggest we get past the Leviathan?\" Kael asked.\nBefore anyone could answer, Arin's head suddenly snapped in their direction. A smile spread across her face-the same terrible, beautiful smile from before.\n\"I know you're there,\" she called, her voice echoing oddly. \"Come out. Let me show you what I've found.\"\nThey traded wary glances, then slowly emerged from their hiding place. The Leviathan growled, a sound that vibrated the water around them, but Arin raised a hand and it fell quiet.\n\"Arin,\" Sophia said slowly, \"what's happening to you?\"\nArin looked down at her hands, studying the black veins with interest. \"Evolution, Sophia. I'm becoming more than I was.\"\n\"That thing is corrupting you,\" Tharros said, his voice hard with worry. \"Let us help you remove it.\"\nArin laughed, the sound musical yet wrong. \"Remove it? Why would I want that? Do you have any idea what I can see now? What I can feel?\" She spun in a circle, trails of dark energy following her moves. \"The knowledge, the power...\"",

        "content": "Sophia swam closer, ignoring Kael's warning hand on her arm. \"Arin, please. This isn't you.\"\nSomething flickered in Arin's eyes-a moment of understanding, perhaps. \"I'm still me, Sophia. Just... more.\"\nThe Leviathan shifted restlessly, its huge head moving closer to Arin. She reached out to touch it without fear, her hand tiny against its huge scales.\n\"He's been waiting so long,\" she said softly. \"Trapped in darkness, forced to guard what he never chose to protect.\"\n\"The Leviathan was a guardian,\" Sophia remembered. \"Created to protect the Heart.\"\nArin nodded. \"And twisted by it. The Heart's power was too much. It changed him.\" She looked down at the shard in her chest. \"But I'm stronger. I can control it.\"\n\"No one can control that kind of power,\" Tharros warned. \"It will consume you, just as it consumed the Leviathan.\"\nArin's face hardened. \"You always misjudged me, Tharros. All of you did.\" The darkness around her pulsed with her anger. \"But no more.\"\nShe raised her hands, and the water around them began to swirl with dark energy. Ancient symbols appeared in the currents-writing that Sophia had never seen before.\n\"The old language,\" Kael breathed. \"From before the Sundering.\"\n\"I can read it now,\" Arin said, watching the symbols dance around her fingers. \"I can understand what no one has understood for millennia.\"\nDespite her fear, Sophia couldn't help but be fascinated. \"What does it say?\"\nArin's eyes met hers, and for a moment, Sophia saw her friend again behind the whirling darkness. \"It's a history. The true tale of the Heart, the Leviathan, and the barriers between worlds.\"\nShe waved her hand, and more symbols appeared, making a complex pattern in the water. \"The Heart wasn't made to separate worlds. It was made to heal them.\"\n\"Heal them?\" Tharros asked, confusion clear on his face.\n\"The barriers weren't meant to be permanent,\" Arin explained, her voice getting stronger. \"They were emergency measures, to give the worlds time to recover from the war.\"\n\"But that was thousands of years ago,\" Kael said.\nArin nodded. \"And the guardians who created the barriers died before they could complete their job. The third stage-the healing-never happened.\" She touched the shard in her chest. \"That knowledge was lost... until now.\"\nThe Leviathan growled again, its massive body tensing. Arin put a calming hand on its scales.\n\"He remembers,\" she said softly. \"The original goal. The promise that was broken.\"\nSophia's mind was racing. \"So the renewal ceremony...\"\n\"Was never about replacing the Leviathan,\" Arin ended. \"It was supposed to be the beginning of the healing process.\" Her eyes sparked with excitement. \"Don't you see? We don't need to bind another being to endless servitude. We can finish what was started thousands of years ago.\"\nHope bloomed in Sophia's chest. \"We can heal the barriers instead of maintaining them.\"\n\"Yes,\" Arin said, putting out her hand toward Sophia. \"But I need your help. All of you.\"\nTharros and Kael traded wary glances.\n\"Arin,\" Tharros said slowly, \"how can we trust that this is really you speaking, and not the corruption?\"\nPain flashed across Arin's face. The darkness around her surged, then settled. \"I'm fighting it,\" she admitted, her voice strained. \"But I don't know how long I can hold on.\"\nAs if to highlight her words, the black veins on her skin pulsed, spreading farther across her body. She gasped in pain, doubling over.\n\"Arin!\" Sophia cried, running forward.\nThe Leviathan moved to block her way, but Arin raised a trembling hand.\n\"No,\" she ordered. \"Let her through.\"\nThe massive thing reluctantly moved aside, its ancient eyes fixed on Sophia with suspicion.\nSophia reached Arin and took her hands. They were ice cold. \"We'll help you,\" she promised. \"Just tell us how.\"\nArin's eyes cleared briefly, the warm amber showing through the swirling darkness. \"The shard,\" she whispered. \"It holds memories-the Leviathan's memories. The key to beating the corruption is hidden within them.\"\nHer body suddenly convulsed, the darkness rushing around her. When she looked up again, her eyes were once more pools of whirling black and purple.\n\"But you'll have to hurry,\" she said, her voice faraway and strange. \"Because I don't think I can fight it much longer.\"\n The First Guardian\nArin's body shook as darkness pulsed through her veins. Sophia held tight to her friend's cold hands, unwilling to let go even as the corruption spread.\n\"How can we see these memories?\" Sophia asked, her voice steady despite her fear.\nArin closed her eyes, fighting for control. When she opened them again, flickers of amber showed through the whirling darkness. \"I can show you,\" she whispered. \"But you must be prepared. What you'll see isn't easy to watch.\"\nTharros swam closer, his golden eyes fixed on Arin. \"We're ready.\"\nKael nodded in agreement, though wariness remained etched in his features.\nArin took a deep breath and pressed her hands against the crystal shard embedded in her chest. It pulsed in reaction, black light seeping between her fingers. \"Join hands,\" she ordered. \"Form a circle.\"\nThey obeyed, forming a ring around her. As soon as the circle was complete, the darkness around them changed. The Heart room, the crystals, even the looming presence of the Leviathan faded away. In their place came images-vivid and real as life.\nFour figures stood on what looked like a beach, though the sky above was strange-filled with whirling colors instead of clouds. The figures wore robes that seemed made from light itself, their faces serious as they drew patterns in the sand.\n\"The Four Creators,\" Arin's voice stated, though her lips didn't move. \"From the time before the barriers.\"\nThe scene changed. The same four figures now stood in a circle, just as Sophia and her friends did now. Between them, energy gathered-blues, greens, and golds flowing together. The energy grew, spreading upward and outward, taking shape.\nA sinuous form emerged, beautiful and terrible. Not the corrupted Leviathan they knew, but a thing of pure light and power.\n\"The First Guardian,\" Arin's voice whispered in their thoughts. \"Created to be the living barrier between worlds.\"\nThe picture changed again. The Guardian swam through waters filled with life-creatures Sophia had never seen before, half-water and half-light. It moved between them and a storm of darkness that threatened from above.\n\"For centuries, the Guardian protected the balance,\" Arin continued. \"Preventing catastrophic interactions between surface magic and sea magic.\"\nThe pictures darkened. The beautiful waters grew cloudy. Strange objects-metal and plastic-began to appear, sinking from above. Dark liquids poured from pipes. The Guardian swam through it all, its once-bright scales turning dull.\n\"Pollution,\" Sophia realized aloud. \"From the human world.\"\n\"Yes,\" Arin's voice confirmed. \"And worse...\"\nThe vision showed warfare-explosions both above and below the water. Magic weapons fired from ships. Underwater towns retaliating with their own weapons. The Guardian put itself between them, absorbing the magical backlash.\nSophia felt tears forming in her eyes as she watched the Guardian's pain. Its body twisted in pain as rot spread through its scales-the same black veins that now covered Arin's skin.\n\"It was poisoned,\" Tharros growled, anger obvious in his voice. \"By both worlds.\"\nThe four robed figures appeared again, older now, their light dimmed. They surrounded the corrupted Guardian, their expressions filled with sadness.\n\"They couldn't heal it,\" Kael muttered. \"So they bound it instead.\"\nThe vision showed an elaborate ceremony in a chamber of crystal and coral. The Guardian writhed as chains of light wrapped around it, pushing it down, binding it to the Heart that pulsed in the chamber's center.\n\"Not chains,\" Arin corrected, pain in her voice. \"A collar. They tried to contain the corruption while preserving the Guardian's mission. But they died before they could finish the healing ritual.\"\nThe images faded, leaving them floating once more in the Heart room. The Leviathan watched them with ancient eyes that now seemed less malicious and more sorrowful.\nArin slumped forward, tired by the effort of sharing the memories. Sophia caught her, shocked by how cold her skin had become.\n\"The corruption is spreading faster,\" Tharros observed, referring to the black veins that now covered most of Arin's arms and neck.\n\"I can handle it,\" Arin insisted, though her voice was weak. She pushed herself upright, her eyes flickering between amber and black. \"There's more you need to see.\"\nShe raised her hands again, and the water around them whirled. This time, instead of visions, the currents made a map-tunnels and chambers spreading out from the Heart like the branches of a tree.\n\"The binding chamber,\" Arin said, referring to a large space several tunnels away. \"That's where we need to go.\"\n\"Why there?\" Sophia asked.\n\"Because that's where the original ritual was performed,\" Arin explained. \"The magic is still stronger there. If we're going to free the Leviathan and fix the barriers, that's where it must happen.\"\nThe Leviathan growled, circling them restlessly.\n\"He knows,\" Arin said, putting a hand on its scales. \"He remembers the room. He's afraid to return there.\"\n\"Can you blame him?\" Kael asked. \"That's where he was imprisoned.\"\n\"Not imprisoned,\" Arin amended. \"Bound. There's a difference.\" She winced as another pulse of darkness moved through her. \"We don't have much time. The rot is spreading to the Heart itself.\"\nShe was right. Looking at the swirling vortex of energy, Sophia could see dark tendrils getting thicker, spreading through the once-vibrant colors.\n\"If the Heart falls completely to corruption, the barriers between worlds will collapse,\" Tharros said grimly. \"Both surface and sea will be destroyed.\"\nArin pushed away from Sophia, swimming toward one of the tunnels marked on her map. \"This way.\"\nThey followed, with the Leviathan gliding behind them like a giant shadow. The tunnels were narrow in places, causing the great creature to compress its enormous body, but it never lost sight of them.\nAs they swam, Arin continued to fight the darkness. Sometimes her eyes would clear entirely, and Sophia would glimpse her friend's true self. Other times, the corruption would surge, leaving her cold and remote.\n\"Why isn't the shard affecting you like it did the Leviathan?\" Sophia asked during one of Arin's clearer times.\nArin smiled slightly. \"Because I'm not alone. The Leviathan had no one to help fight the rot. I have you.\"\nThe tunnel opened into a vast room that took Sophia's breath away. Unlike the dark crystal of the Heart chamber, this place was made of pure white coral, etched with thousands of symbols that glowed with soft blue light.\nIn the middle stood four pillars arranged in a perfect square. Within the square was a depression in the floor, shaped like a coiled snake.\n\"The binding circle,\" Arin said, her voice filled with awe. \"Untouched for millennia.\"\nThe Leviathan hung back at the door, unwilling to enter. It made a sound-not a growl, but almost a whimper.\n\"It's okay,\" Arin said to it gently. \"We're not here to bind you again. We're here to set you free.\"\nSophia approached the circle, studying the marks carved into the floor. \"These look like the ones you showed us earlier. The old language.\"\nArin nodded, swimming to join her. \"The ritual instructions.\" She traced her fingers over the figures, translating as she went. \"Four powers united... darkness balanced by light... surface joined with sea...\" She stopped suddenly, her body going stiff.\n\"What is it?\" Tharros asked, moving quickly to her side.\n\"The ritual,\" Arin said, her voice hushed. \"It needs power from both worlds-surface and sea. Without both, the binding cannot be broken, nor the healing finished.\"\n\"Surface power?\" Kael frowned. \"But we're all from the sea.\"\n\"No,\" Sophia said slowly, a chill running down her spine. \"I'm not. Not originally.\"\nAll eyes turned to her.\n\"I was born on the surface,\" she continued. \"My magic woke here, but it's not the same as yours. It's... different.\"\nArin's eyes cleared completely for a moment, burning with sudden hope. \"That's why you were called to us. Why the prophesy spoke of a fourth who would join our bond. You're the surface power we need.\"\n\"But how do we perform the ritual?\" Tharros asked, looking around the old chamber. \"The Creators left no instructions beyond these symbols.\"\nArin returned to the markings, running her hands over more symbols. As she touched them, they glowed brighter, reacting to her magic.\n\"The ritual requires four points of power,\" she translated. \"Each representing a part of balance. Dragon for fire, Mer for water, Witch for spirit...\" She stopped, looking at Sophia. \"And Human for earth.\"\n\"Like the four Creators,\" Sophia realized.\n\"Exactly,\" Arin said. \"They built the pattern into the ritual itself, ensuring it could be repeated if needed.\" She smiled, though the effort clearly cost her as darkness pumped through her veins. \"They planned for this day.\"\nHer smile disappeared suddenly as her body convulsed. The black veins pulsed fiercely, spreading up her neck toward her face.\n\"Arin!\" Sophia cried, running to catch her as she fell.\n\"The shard,\" Arin gasped, clutching at her chest where the crystal was attached. \"It knows what we're planning. It's fighting back.\"\nThe Leviathan roared from the entrance, its massive body thrashing in obvious pain.\n\"The corruption is accelerating,\" Tharros said grimly. \"In both of them.\"\nArin's eyes flashed between amber and swirling black, faster and faster. \"You have to perform the ritual,\" she managed through gritted teeth. \"Now. Before it's too late.\"\n\"But we don't know how,\" Kael argued.\n\"I do,\" Arin whispered, her voice getting weaker. \"The shard showed me.\" She pointed to the four pillars. \"Take your places. I'll help you.\"\n\"What about you?\" Sophia asked, unwilling to let go of her friend's hand.\nArin looked down at the rot spreading across her skin. When she raised her eyes again, they were filled with a terrible resolve.\n\"I'll be the conduit,\" she said quietly. \"The channel between the Leviathan and the ritual.\"\nUnderstanding dawned on Sophia's face, followed quickly by fear. \"No. That's too dangerous.\"\n\"It's the only way,\" Arin insisted. \"Someone has to direct the corruption as it leaves the Leviathan.\" She squeezed Sophia's hand. \"Don't worry. I've always been good at handling darkness.\"\nBefore anyone could argue further, the chamber shook. Cracks emerged in the ancient coral walls as the corruption from the Heart reached them.\n\"We're out of time,\" Tharros said. \"The barriers are beginning to fail.\"\nArin pushed herself to her feet, determination winning over pain. \"Take your positions,\" she commanded. \"Dragon to the east. Mer to the west. Human to the north. I'll take the south.\"\nAs they moved to their places, Arin turned to face the Leviathan still hovering at the door.\n\"It's time,\" she called to it. \"Time to be free.\"\n  The Binding Ritual\nArin's words hung in the air. \"Time to be free.\"\nThe Leviathan trembled at the chamber entrance. Its massive body shifted, scales rippling with anticipation and fear.\nSophia took her position at the northern pillar, her hands shaking. The white coral beneath her palms felt warm, almost alive. She glanced at her friends-Tharros at the east pillar, his golden eyes fixed on the Leviathan; Kael at the west, his jaw set with determination; and Arin at the south, darkness pulsing through her veins.\n\"What do we do now?\" Sophia called.\nArin placed her palms against the pillar. \"Channel your power into the pillar. Focus on healing, on balance.\"\nAs Sophia closed her eyes and concentrated, she felt something stir within her-her surface magic, different from the others yet complementary. The pillar beneath her hands began to glow with soft green light.\n\"That's it,\" Arin encouraged, her voice strained. \"Everyone, focus on your element. Tharros, fire. Kael, water. Sophia, earth. I'll channel spirit.\"\nAround the chamber, the other pillars lit up-Tharros's blazing red, Kael's deep blue, and Arin's swirling purple. The lights spread from the pillars, following the carved patterns on the floor until they met in the center, illuminating the serpent-shaped depression.\nThe Leviathan growled, backing away.\n\"He needs to enter the circle,\" Arin gasped, black veins now creeping up her face. \"Sophia, call to him.\"\n\"Me? Why me?\"\n\"Because you're the missing piece,\" Arin explained, wincing as darkness pulsed through her. \"The bridge between worlds.\"\nSophia took a deep breath and looked at the creature. Not a monster, she reminded herself. A guardian. Poisoned and suffering.\n\"It's okay,\" she called softly. \"We're going to help you.\"",

        "content": "The Leviathan's eyes fixed on her-ancient eyes filled with centuries of pain. It moved forward slowly, its enormous body gliding into the chamber.\n\"That's it,\" Sophia encouraged. \"Come closer.\"\nAs the Leviathan approached the center of the room, the symbols on the floor glowed brighter. The serpent-shaped depression in the floor pulsed with energy, calling to the creature.\n\"Now what?\" Kael asked, sweat beading on his forehead as he maintained his connection to the pillar.\nArin's hands trembled against her pillar. \"The Leviathan must enter the binding circle. When it does, we'll reverse the ritual-not to bind, but to heal.\"\nThe great creature hesitated at the edge of the circle, its body coiling nervously.\n\"It's afraid,\" Tharros growled. \"It remembers the pain.\"\nArin nodded, her eyes flickering between amber and darkness. \"I'll guide it.\" She stepped away from her pillar, moving toward the Leviathan.\n\"Arin, wait!\" Sophia cried. \"The ritual-\"\n\"Keep your positions,\" Arin commanded. \"I'll return to mine when it's time.\"\nShe approached the Leviathan, her hands outstretched. The corruption within her seemed to call to the darkness in the creature. It lowered its massive head, allowing her to touch its scales.\n\"I understand your pain,\" Arin whispered. \"I feel it too.\"\nThe chamber trembled suddenly, dust and fragments of coral falling from the ceiling.\n\"The barriers are weakening faster,\" Kael warned. \"We need to hurry.\"\nArin guided the Leviathan toward the circle, speaking to it in words too quiet for the others to hear. With each step, the creature seemed less afraid, drawn to Arin's understanding.\n\"Now,\" Arin said as the Leviathan hovered over the serpent depression. \"Complete the circuit.\"\nShe rushed back to her pillar, placing her hands against it just as the Leviathan settled into the depression. The moment it did, energy surged through the room. The symbols carved into the walls blazed with light, and the four pillars pulsed in unison.\n\"Focus on healing,\" Arin instructed, her voice strained. \"Imagine the corruption flowing out of the Guardian, returning to pure energy.\"\nSophia concentrated, picturing the darkness leaving the Leviathan's body. She felt her power connecting with the others, forming a circuit of energy that flowed through the pillars, through them, and into the circle where the Leviathan lay.\nThe creature's body began to glow, the black veins in its scales lighting up from within. It writhed in apparent pain, but remained in the circle.\n\"It's working,\" Tharros called. \"The corruption is separating from its body.\"\nBlack energy began to rise from the Leviathan like smoke, swirling in the center of their circle. But instead of disappearing, it hovered, growing denser.\n\"Something's wrong,\" Kael shouted. \"The corruption-it has nowhere to go!\"\nArin's eyes cleared suddenly, understanding dawning on her face. \"The conduit,\" she whispered. \"It needs a conduit.\"\nBefore anyone could stop her, Arin stepped away from her pillar and into the circle. The swirling darkness rushed toward her, drawn to the corruption already inside her.\n\"Arin, no!\" Sophia screamed.\nBut it was too late. The darkness enveloped Arin, pouring into her through the crystal shard in her chest. Her body arched in pain, suspended in the center of the circle as the corruption left the Leviathan and entered her.\n\"What is she doing?\" Tharros demanded, his pillar's light flickering as his concentration wavered.\n\"Taking the corruption into herself,\" Sophia realized with horror. \"She's saving the Guardian by sacrificing herself.\"\nThe Leviathan's scales began to change, black giving way to shimmering blue and silver. Its eyes cleared, golden light replacing the darkness that had clouded them for centuries.\n\"Don't break the circle,\" Kael warned as Sophia made to move toward Arin. \"If we stop now, all is lost.\"\nTears streamed down Sophia's face as she watched her friend absorb the corruption. Arin's body was almost completely black now, only her eyes still visible, glowing amber through the darkness.\n\"Arin, fight it!\" Sophia called. \"Don't let it take you!\"\nA smile flickered across Arin's face. \"It's okay,\" she gasped. \"This is my purpose.\"\nThe Leviathan rose from the depression, its transformation complete. No longer a creature of darkness, it glowed with inner light, beautiful and terrible as in the visions Arin had shown them.\nIt circled Arin, studying her with ancient eyes that now held wisdom instead of pain. Then, to everyone's surprise, it pressed its massive head against her.\nLight flowed from the Guardian into Arin, gold and silver streaming into the darkness that consumed her. The black veins across her skin began to pulse, not with corruption, but with light fighting to break through.\n\"What's happening?\" Sophia asked, hope rising in her chest.\n\"The Guardian is healing her,\" Tharros said in awe. \"Just as she healed it.\"\nThe chamber filled with blinding light as the Leviathan poured its power into Arin. When it faded, Arin stood transformed. The black veins were gone, replaced by delicate silver patterns that looked like flowing water. The crystal shard in her chest no longer pulsed with darkness but glowed with soft blue light.\nShe turned to them, her eyes clear and bright. \"It's done.\"\nAs if responding to her words, the chamber shuddered violently. Cracks spread across the walls and ceiling, pieces of coral crashing to the floor.\n\"The binding chamber is collapsing!\" Kael shouted. \"Without the corruption to maintain it, the ancient magic is fading!\"\n\"We need to get out!\" Tharros grabbed Sophia's hand, pulling her toward the tunnel.\nArin swayed on her feet, exhausted by the transformation. The Leviathan nudged her gently, offering its body for support.\n\"Go!\" Sophia yelled as a massive piece of coral crashed down where Kael had been standing moments before. \"We'll follow!\"\nTharros hesitated, torn between staying with Sophia and leading the way to safety.\n\"I'm right behind you,\" she promised.\nAs Tharros and Kael swam toward the exit, Sophia helped Arin onto the Leviathan's back. The creature waited patiently, seemingly understanding its role as protector once more.\n\"Hold tight,\" Sophia instructed, climbing up behind her friend.\nJust as they settled onto the Guardian's back, the ceiling gave way. Tons of coral and crystal plummeted toward them.\n\"Go!\" Sophia screamed.\nThe Leviathan surged forward with unexpected speed, racing for the tunnel as the binding chamber collapsed behind them. They barely made it through the entrance before it sealed with fallen debris.\nIn the darkness of the tunnel, the Leviathan's scales provided the only light, glowing softly as it carried them away from danger.\n\"We did it,\" Arin whispered, leaning back against Sophia. \"We freed the Guardian.\"\nSophia squeezed her friend's hand, relief washing over her. But as they rounded a corner, her heart stopped.\nAhead of them, the tunnel split into three paths. Of Tharros and Kael, there was no sign.\n\"Which way?\" Sophia asked, panic rising in her throat.\nThe Leviathan hesitated, sensing her fear.\nArin sat up straighter, the silver patterns on her skin glowing brighter. \"Listen,\" she said.\nIn the silence of the tunnel, Sophia heard it-a distant rumbling. Not from behind them, but from ahead.\n\"Something's wrong,\" Arin whispered. \"The Heart-it's still in danger.\"\nThe Leviathan growled in agreement, its body tensing beneath them.\n\"What do we do?\" Sophia asked.\nArin's eyes glinted with determination despite her exhaustion. \"We find the others. And we finish what we started.\"\nThe Guardian surged forward, choosing the middle path. As they raced through the tunnel, Sophia couldn't shake the feeling that the worst was yet to come.\n The Keeper of Balance\nThe Leviathan moved swiftly through the tunnel, its glowing scales lighting their path. Sophia held tightly to Arin, whose silver patterns pulsed in rhythm with the Guardian's movements.\n\"Do you think Tharros and Kael made it out?\" Sophia asked, trying to keep the worry from her voice.\nArin squeezed her hand. \"They're strong. And clever. If anyone can navigate these tunnels, it's them.\"\nThe tunnel widened suddenly, opening into a vast chamber that took Sophia's breath away. Unlike the binding room's white coral, this chamber was formed of crystal that shimmered with every color imaginable. At its center floated a sphere of pure energy-pulsing, swirling, alive.\n\"The Heart,\" Arin whispered in awe. \"We've come full circle.\"\nThe Leviathan slowed, approaching the Heart cautiously. Its body language had changed-no longer fearful, but reverent.\n\"Look!\" Sophia pointed to two figures near the Heart. \"Tharros and Kael!\"\nRelief flooded through her as she recognized her friends, but it quickly turned to confusion. They weren't moving-frozen in place, suspended in mid-motion as if time had stopped around them.\nThe Leviathan lowered itself, allowing Sophia and Arin to slide from its back. They swam cautiously toward their friends.\n\"What happened to them?\" Sophia reached out to touch Tharros's arm. It was warm, alive, but completely still.\n\"They're in stasis,\" Arin explained, examining the strange energy field around them. \"Something-or someone-has paused them.\"\n\"That would be me,\" said a voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.",

        "content": "The Heart pulsed brightly, and from its center emerged a figure unlike anything Sophia had ever seen. It appeared human-shaped but was composed of flowing elements-parts of it rippled like water, others flickered like flame, some sections solid as earth, others transparent as air.\n\"Who are you?\" Sophia asked, instinctively moving closer to Arin.\nThe figure inclined its head. \"I am the Keeper. The third Guardian. The one who maintains balance.\"\nThe Leviathan bowed its massive head in recognition, a low rumble of respect emanating from its throat.\n\"You froze our friends,\" Sophia accused, finding courage in her concern.\n\"A temporary measure,\" the Keeper replied, its voice gentle. \"I needed to speak with you without... distractions.\"\nArin stepped forward, the silver patterns on her skin brightening. \"You're the original Guardian, aren't you? The one from the visions-before the Leviathan.\"\nThe Keeper nodded, its form shifting between elements as it moved. \"I was first. Then came the Leviathan when the barriers needed stronger protection.\" It gestured to the Heart. \"What you see here is the core of all magic in this realm-the connection point between worlds.\"\n\"It's dying,\" Sophia realized, noting the dark tendrils still creeping through the swirling energy. \"Even after healing the Leviathan, the corruption continues.\"\n\"Because the corruption was never the true problem,\" the Keeper explained. \"It was merely a symptom.\"\nArin frowned. \"A symptom of what?\"\n\"Separation.\" The Keeper waved its hand, and images appeared in the crystal walls around them-the four Creators building barriers, isolating magic, dividing sea from surface. \"What was meant to be temporary became permanent. The worlds grew apart when they were designed to flow together.\"\nSophia's scientific mind raced with understanding. \"Like damming a river. Eventually, the pressure builds until something breaks.\"\n\"Precisely.\" The Keeper's form rippled with approval. \"The barriers were necessary once, when both worlds were young and unstable. But that time has passed. Now, the separation causes more harm than good.\"\nA tremor shook the chamber, causing crystal shards to fall from the ceiling. The Leviathan growled nervously, its tail swishing through the water.\n\"The Heart is failing,\" the Keeper warned. \"Soon, the barriers will collapse catastrophically. Both worlds will suffer.\"\n\"So what do we do?\" Sophia asked. \"How do we fix it?\"\nThe Keeper looked at each of them in turn-Sophia with her surface magic, Arin with her newly transformed power, the Leviathan with its ancient strength.\n\"You must not bind the Leviathan again,\" it said firmly. \"That would only delay the inevitable. Instead, you must heal the breach between worlds.\"\n\"How?\" Arin asked, her voice tinged with frustration. \"We barely managed to heal the Guardian. How can we possibly heal the separation between entire worlds?\"\nThe Keeper smiled, its face shifting from flame to water. \"The same way you healed the Leviathan. Through balance. Through accepting that things once separated must flow together again.\"\nThe chamber shook more violently this time. Cracks appeared in the crystal walls, dark energy seeping through them.\n\"We're running out of time,\" the Keeper said urgently. \"The Heart cannot maintain the barriers much longer.\"\nSophia looked at her frozen friends, then at Arin and the Leviathan. \"Tell us what to do.\"\nThe Keeper's form began to fade, merging partially with the Heart. \"I offer you a choice. You can attempt to bind the corruption again-a temporary solution that your friends would prefer.\" It nodded toward Tharros and Kael. \"Or you can follow me to learn the true solution-one that will require great sacrifice but will heal both worlds permanently.\"\n\"What kind of sacrifice?\" Sophia asked, her throat tight with fear.\nThe Keeper's eyes-now pools of swirling magic-fixed on her. \"The kind only someone with connections to both worlds can make.\"\nSophia understood immediately. \"Me. You need me to sacrifice something.\"\nArin grabbed her hand. \"No. There must be another way.\"\nAnother violent tremor shook the chamber. A large section of crystal wall collapsed, revealing the tunnels beyond-now filled with swirling darkness.\n\"Decide quickly,\" the Keeper urged, its form increasingly transparent. \"The corruption approaches-and this time, it comes not just from the Leviathan, but from the Heart itself.\"\nThe Leviathan nudged Sophia gently with its snout, its golden eyes filled with what looked surprisingly like concern.\n\"If I follow you,\" Sophia asked the Keeper, \"what happens to my friends?\"\n\"They will be released from stasis. Whether they follow is their choice.\"\nSophia looked at Tharros and Kael, still frozen mid-motion. Then at Arin, whose face showed both fear and fierce determination.\n\"I'll go with you,\" Arin said firmly. \"Whatever happens, we face it together.\"\nThe Leviathan rumbled in agreement, positioning itself beside them.\nAnother crash echoed through the chamber as more crystal walls gave way. In the distance, Sophia could see dark tendrils moving through the water, consuming everything in their path.\n\"Time to choose,\" the Keeper whispered, extending a hand formed of all four elements. \"Bind or heal. Temporary safety or permanent solution.\"\nSophia took a deep breath, her mind racing. Everything she'd learned as a scientist told her to be cautious, to take the known path. But everything she'd learned in Aquaria told her that sometimes, the greatest discoveries required the biggest risks.\nShe reached out, her fingers inches from the Keeper's outstretched hand.\n\"I choose-\"\nA roar interrupted her as something massive burst through the far wall of the chamber. Not the corruption, but something worse-a second Leviathan, this one still consumed by darkness, its eyes blazing with ancient hatred.\n\"Impossible,\" Arin gasped. \"There were never two Guardians.\"\nThe Keeper's form flickered with alarm. \"The corruption has taken form. It seeks to destroy the Heart directly.\"\nThe corrupted Leviathan spotted them and surged forward, its massive jaws open wide. Their Leviathan moved to intercept, positioning itself between them and the threat.\nAs the two massive creatures collided in a tangle of light and darkness, the Keeper pulled Sophia and Arin toward a previously hidden tunnel behind the Heart.\n\"Quickly,\" it urged. \"While they fight, we must reach the Source.\"\n\"What about Tharros and Kael?\" Sophia cried, looking back at her still-frozen friends.\n\"The stasis will protect them from the immediate battle,\" the Keeper assured her. \"But we must hurry if we're to save any of them.\"\nWith one last glance at her friends and the battling Leviathans, Sophia made her choice. She grabbed Arin's hand and followed the Keeper into the tunnel, the sounds of combat fading behind them.\n\"Where are we going?\" Arin asked as they swam through a passage that seemed to be made of pure light.\nThe Keeper's voice echoed around them. \"To the beginning. To where the barriers were first created.\"\nSophia's heart pounded as they moved deeper into the unknown. Whatever sacrifice awaited her, she would face it. For her friends. For both worlds.\nBut as the passage brightened around them, a chill ran down her spine. Something told her that what waited at the end of this tunnel would change everything-and everyone-forever.\n Two Paths\nSophia's heart pounded as she and Arin followed the Keeper deeper into the passage of light. The sounds of the battling Leviathans faded behind them, replaced by an eerie silence that pressed against her ears.\n\"How much further?\" she asked, her voice echoing strangely in the tunnel.\nThe Keeper, still shifting between elements-now fire, now water, now earth, now air-glanced back. \"Not far. The Source lies just ahead.\"\nArin swam closer to Sophia, her silver markings pulsing with uncertainty. \"I don't like leaving Tharros and Kael behind,\" she whispered. \"Especially with that... thing attacking them.\"\n\"I know.\" Sophia squeezed Arin's hand. \"But the Keeper said they're protected by the stasis field, right?\"\nThe Keeper's form flickered. \"For now. But we must hurry. The corrupt Leviathan grows stronger with each passing moment.\"",

        "content": "The tunnel suddenly widened, opening into a small chamber unlike anything they'd seen before. Where the Heart had been all movement and color, this space was perfectly still-a sphere of absolute calm. At its center floated what looked like a tiny star, no bigger than Sophia's palm.\n\"What is it?\" Sophia asked, drawn toward the glowing object.\n\"A seed,\" the Keeper explained. \"The opposite of corruption. Pure creative energy from which all magic in both worlds was born.\"\nArin gasped, her hands flying to her chest where dark tendrils had once spread. Sophia noticed with surprise that the corruption marks on Arin's skin were fading, replaced by silver light that matched her natural patterns.\n\"Your corruption,\" Sophia said. \"It's healing!\"\nArin stared at her hands in wonder. \"The pain... it's gone.\"\nThe Keeper nodded. \"The seed cleanses all corruption in its presence. This is what you need to heal the Leviathan-not binding, but purification.\"\nSophia moved closer to the seed, mesmerized by its gentle glow. \"How do we use it?\"\n\"That depends on you,\" the Keeper said. \"You carry magic from both worlds inside you, Sophia. You are the bridge. And Arin...\" The Keeper turned to the sea witch. \"Show me what you carry.\"\nArin hesitated, then reached into a small pouch tied at her waist. She pulled out a fragment of crystal that pulsed with the same energy as the seed.\n\"The shard!\" Sophia exclaimed. \"Where did you get that?\"\n\"I found it years ago, when I was still learning magic,\" Arin explained. \"It called to me from an ancient ruin. I never understood its purpose until now.\"\nThe Keeper's form brightened. \"The missing piece. The Creators split the original seed for safety, leaving fragments throughout both worlds. This shard, combined with Sophia's dual nature and the seed itself, can purify the Leviathan rather than simply contain it.\"\nA violent tremor shook the chamber, sending ripples through the water.\n\"What was that?\" Sophia grabbed onto Arin to steady herself.\nThe Keeper's expression darkened. \"Your friends. The stasis field has broken. They face the corrupt Leviathan now.\"\nArin's face paled. \"We have to go back!\"\n\"No,\" the Keeper said firmly. \"That's exactly what the corruption wants-to separate us, to prevent the healing from happening. We must complete our task here.\"\nSophia felt torn between rushing back to help Tharros and Kael and continuing with their current path. \"What do we do with the seed?\"\n\"First, you must understand what it means to use it,\" the Keeper warned. \"The seed's power will dissolve all barriers between worlds-not just the corrupt ones, but all of them. Magic will flow freely between sea and surface again.\"\n\"Isn't that what we want?\" Sophia asked.\n\"Yes and no. With barriers gone, both worlds will change forever. Some creatures may not survive the transformation. And you, Sophia...\" The Keeper's voice softened. \"Your connection to both worlds means you will be most affected of all.\"\nSophia swallowed hard. \"What will happen to me?\"\n\"I cannot say for certain. You might retain your ability to walk in both worlds. Or you might have to choose one forever.\"\nAnother, stronger tremor shook the chamber. This time, they heard a distant roar that made their blood run cold.\n\"That's the Leviathan,\" Arin whispered. \"It's found Tharros and Kael.\"\nThe Keeper moved to the seed. \"We have little time. Sophia, take the seed. Arin, the shard. Together, you must channel your combined power into them. But be warned-once begun, this process cannot be stopped.\"\nSophia locked eyes with Arin. \"Are you ready?\"\nArin's silver patterns pulsed brightly. \"Whatever happens, we do this together.\"\nBefore they could reach for the seed, a massive crash echoed through the tunnels. Water rushed past them as something large moved through the passages.\n\"They're coming,\" the Keeper warned. \"Quick, take the seed!\"\nSophia stretched out her hand toward the glowing star, her fingers just inches away from its surface. At the same moment, a familiar voice called out from the tunnel behind them.\n\"Sophia, stop!\"\nShe turned to see Tharros and Kael swimming toward them, their bodies battered from battle but very much alive. Behind them, their Leviathan followed, its scales dimmer than before.\n\"Don't listen to the Keeper!\" Tharros shouted. \"It's not telling you everything!\"\nKael pushed forward. \"We've prepared the binding ritual. It's safer-we can contain the corruption without risking everything!\"\nThe Keeper's form darkened. \"They speak from fear, not wisdom. The binding will fail eventually, as it always has.\"\n\"Maybe,\" Tharros agreed, \"but your solution means sacrificing Sophia!\"\nSophia's hand froze midway to the seed. \"What?\"\nArin looked between the Keeper and their friends. \"What do you mean, 'sacrificing Sophia'?\"\nKael moved closer. \"The kind of transformation the Keeper is talking about-it will burn through her hybrid nature. She might survive, but she won't be Sophia anymore.\"\nThe Keeper didn't deny it. \"All great healings require sacrifice.\"\nSophia felt the weight of both choices pressing down on her. Bind the corruption temporarily, knowing it would eventually break free again? Or heal it permanently, at the cost of herself?\nA deafening roar shattered her thoughts as the corrupt Leviathan burst into the chamber, its dark form filling the tunnel behind Tharros and Kael. Their Leviathan moved to intercept it, but was clearly weakened from their earlier battle.\n\"Decide now!\" the Keeper urged, its form beginning to dissolve into the seed. \"Bind or heal. There is no middle path!\"\nSophia looked at her friends-at Tharros's fierce protective stance, at Kael's determined eyes, at Arin's glowing silver patterns. Then at the seed, pulsing with pure creation energy, and the shard in Arin's hand.\n\"What about a third option?\" she whispered, an idea forming in her mind.\nThe corrupt Leviathan lunged forward, jaws wide as darkness poured from its mouth. Their Leviathan intercepted it, coiling around its dark twin in a desperate wrestling match that threatened to destroy the entire chamber.\n\"There is no third option!\" the Keeper insisted, now barely visible as it merged with the seed.\nBut Sophia wasn't listening anymore. Her scientific mind raced with possibilities, connecting dots no one else had seen. The seed. The shard. Her hybrid nature. The Leviathans-not enemies, but two halves of one whole, just like the worlds they guarded.\n\"Yes, there is,\" she said firmly, reaching one hand toward the seed while extending the other toward Arin's shard. \"And I think I've found it.\"\nAs her fingers touched both objects simultaneously, a blinding light erupted through the chamber. The battling Leviathans froze mid-struggle, their roars cut short. For one breathless moment, everything hung suspended in perfect balance.\nThen the light consumed them all, and the world as they knew it began to change.\nReunion in Darkness\nThe light faded, leaving Sophia blinking in the strange glow of the seed chamber. Her fingers tingled where they had touched both the seed and Arin's shard. Instead of merging as she had expected, the two pieces had sparked against each other, then settled back into their separate forms.\n\"That... wasn't supposed to happen,\" she murmured, staring at her hands.\nArin grabbed her shoulder. \"Look!\"\nThe battling Leviathans had vanished. The tunnel behind them lay empty, silent, as if the massive creatures had never existed.\n\"Where did they go?\" Sophia asked, turning to the Keeper.\nBut the Keeper too had disappeared, leaving only a faint shimmer in the water where it had stood.\nTharros swam forward, his face tight with worry. \"We need to get back to the Heart chamber. Now.\"\n\"But the seed-\" Sophia began.\n\"Bring it,\" Kael interrupted, already moving toward the tunnel. \"And the shard. We'll need both.\"\nWithout waiting for more discussion, he darted into the passage, Tharros close behind. Sophia carefully scooped up the glowing seed, which felt surprisingly solid in her palm. Arin clutched her crystal shard, its light pulsing in rhythm with Sophia's seed.\n\"Did you know this would happen?\" Sophia asked as they swam after the others.\nArin shook her head. \"The shard has always been a mystery to me. I just knew I needed to keep it safe.\"\nThey raced through the tunnels, following the silver trails left by Tharros and Kael. The passages seemed different now-darker in places, with strange shadows that moved against the current.\n\"Something's changed,\" Arin whispered. \"Can you feel it?\"\nSophia nodded. The water itself felt heavier, as if it carried more than just salt and minerals. \"The corruption is spreading.\"\nThey rounded a corner and nearly collided with Kael, who had stopped abruptly. Beyond him, the tunnel opened into a wide chamber that Sophia recognized as the approach to the Heart.\n\"Stay back,\" he warned, his voice low. \"We've got company.\"\nPeering past him, Sophia gasped. Dozens of sea creatures blocked their path-fish, eels, and even a giant squid-but all were wrong somehow. Their eyes glowed with unnatural blackness, and dark tendrils wrapped around their bodies like parasitic vines.\n\"Corrupted,\" Tharros growled. \"The Leviathan is using them as scouts.\"\n\"Can we go around?\" Sophia asked.\nKael shook his head. \"This is the only way back to the Heart chamber.\"\nArin's silver patterns flashed suddenly. \"The seed, Sophia! Remember how it cleansed my corruption? Maybe-\"\n\"Worth a try,\" Sophia agreed, lifting the seed in her palm.\nIts glow intensified as she focused on it, spreading outward in a gentle wave of light. The nearest corrupted creatures writhed as the light touched them, dark tendrils retreating from their bodies. But instead of healing completely, they simply backed away, creating a narrow path.\n\"It's working!\" Arin whispered excitedly.\n\"Not enough,\" Tharros cautioned. \"The corruption runs too deep. We're only pushing it back temporarily.\"\n\"Then let's move,\" Kael said, drawing his weapon. \"While we have a chance.\"\nThey swam forward as a tight group, Sophia holding the seed out before them like a lantern. The corrupted creatures hissed and thrashed but kept their distance from the light.\nAs they approached the final tunnel to the Heart chamber, a loud boom echoed through the water, so powerful they felt it in their bones.\n\"What was that?\" Sophia asked.\nTharros's face darkened. \"The Leviathan. It's attacking the Heart directly.\"\nThey increased their pace, bursting through the final passage into the vast crystal chamber. Sophia skidded to a stop, nearly dropping the seed in shock.\nThe Heart chamber was in chaos. The beautiful crystal walls were cracked and shattered in places. The Heart itself still pulsed in the center, but dark tendrils had wrapped around it, squeezing like a monstrous hand. And on the far side of the chamber, Tharros and Kael-another set of them-worked frantically over a circle of glowing runes.\n\"That's... us,\" Kael whispered beside her.\n\"But how-\" Sophia began, before understanding dawned. \"The light! When I touched both the seed and the shard together, it must have split us somehow.\"\nArin's eyes widened. \"We're in two places at once.\"\nBefore they could process this further, the other Tharros spotted them. His face registered shock, then determination. He gestured urgently for them to join him at the runic circle.\n\"The binding ritual,\" Kael murmured. \"They've nearly completed it.\"\nAs they swam toward their doubles, a wave of darkness swept through the chamber. The corrupted Leviathan hadn't disappeared after all-it had simply moved faster than they could, reaching the Heart chamber first.\nNow it emerged from behind the Heart, its massive form dwarfing even the good Leviathan, which lay wounded but still fighting near one of the crystal walls.\n\"Hurry!\" the other Tharros shouted. \"The binding won't hold much longer!\"\nThey reached the runic circle just as another tremor shook the chamber. Crystal shards rained down from the ceiling, forcing them to dodge and weave.\n\"We found another way,\" Sophia said quickly, showing the seed to her counterparts. \"A way to purify, not just bind.\"\nThe other Sophia-her exact double in every way-stared at the seed in wonder. \"The Source.\"\n\"Yes, but we need all of us to make it work,\" Arin explained, holding up her shard. \"Both sets of us.\"\nThe corrupted Leviathan roared, sensing their plan. Its jaws gaped wide as it lunged toward them.\n\"Decide now!\" both Tharros shouted in unison.\nThe two Sophias looked at each other, a silent understanding passing between them. They were the same person, despite the strange magic that had temporarily split them. They shared the same knowledge, the same heart, the same decision.\n\"Together,\" they said simultaneously, reaching for each other's hands.\nAs their fingers touched, another flash of light erupted, but gentler this time. When it faded, only one Sophia remained, holding both the seed and Arin's shard. Similarly, the others had merged back into single forms-one Tharros, one Kael, one Arin.\n\"Well, that was weird,\" Kael commented, shaking his head as if to clear it.\n\"Focus,\" Tharros snapped, pointing to the runic circle. \"We need to decide. Bind or purify?\"\nSophia stepped forward, feeling the weight of both worlds on her shoulders. The scientific part of her mind calculated odds, risks, variables. The magical part sensed patterns, energies, possibilities.\n\"Binding has failed before,\" she said firmly. \"It will fail again. But purification might cost us everything.\"\n\"Not if we work together,\" Arin added, her silver patterns glowing brightly. \"That's what the Keeper didn't understand. The sacrifice doesn't have to be just one of us.\"\nThe corrupted Leviathan smashed against the last barrier of Tharros's magic, its roar shaking the entire chamber. Cracks spread across the Heart, dark tendrils squeezing tighter.\n\"We don't have time to debate,\" Kael warned, readying his weapon.\nSophia looked at each of her friends in turn-Tharros with his ancient power, Kael with his warrior's courage, Arin with her transformed magic. Then at the seed and shard in her hands, both glowing brighter as they came closer together.",

        "content": "\"We purify,\" she decided. \"But we do it my way.\"\nWith quick, sure movements, she traced a new pattern within the binding circle, altering the ancient runes. Arin instantly understood, adding her own modifications. Tharros and Kael exchanged glances, then nodded, lending their strength to reshape the ritual.\n\"What exactly is your plan?\" Tharros asked as they worked.\nSophia's eyes gleamed with determination. \"Not to destroy the corruption, but to balance it. Not to separate the worlds, but to heal the division. Not one sacrifice, but a shared transformation.\"\nThe chamber shuddered as the corrupted Leviathan broke through the final barrier. Its massive head thrust into the room, jaws snapping at the Heart itself.\n\"Whatever you're going to do,\" Kael shouted over the noise, \"do it now!\"\nSophia placed the seed in the center of their modified circle. Arin added her shard beside it. The two pieces began to orbit each other, picking up speed as they spun.\n\"Join hands!\" Sophia commanded, reaching out to Tharros and Arin.\nThey formed a circle around the spinning seed and shard, their mixed powers flowing into the ritual. The runes blazed with new light-not just white, but all colors swirling together in perfect harmony.\nThe corrupted Leviathan lunged forward, its jaws opening impossibly wide to swallow them all.\nAs darkness descended upon them, Sophia felt a moment of perfect clarity. This was always how it had to end-not with separation, but union. Not with binding, but transformation.\nThe seed and shard collided in a burst of energy that engulfed everything-the ritual circle, the four friends, the Heart, both Leviathans, the entire chamber.\nAnd in that blinding moment of light meeting darkness, all barriers began to fall.\n  Surface Allies\nThe blinding light faded, leaving the Heart chamber eerily quiet. Sophia blinked, her vision slowly returning. Where moments before chaos had reigned, now a strange calm settled over them. The corrupted Leviathan was gone, but so was its counterpart. The Heart still pulsed in the center of the room, its glow steadier but dimmer than before.\n\"Did it work?\" Kael asked, his voice hoarse.\nSophia looked down at her hands. The seed and shard had merged into a single crystal that hummed with energy. \"Not completely,\" she answered. \"We've bought time, but the balance is fragile.\"\nTharros swam to the Heart, examining the cracks running through its surface. \"These won't heal on their own. The corruption has been pushed back, but not eliminated.\"\nArin traced her fingers along the broken crystal walls, her silver patterns flashing with concern. \"The entire network is weakened. Another attack and we'll lose everything.\"\nThe four friends gathered in a circle, exhaustion evident in their faces. They had survived, but victory remained out of reach.\n\"We need something more,\" Sophia said suddenly. \"Something the Leviathan wouldn't expect.\"\n\"More magic?\" Kael suggested, but Sophia shook her head.\n\"Not magic. Science.\" She held up the merged crystal. \"This transformation worked because it combined two different powers. What if we could do that on a larger scale?\"\nTharros frowned. \"What are you suggesting?\"\n\"Surface technology,\" Sophia said. \"My old research equipment could amplify our magical defenses in ways the Leviathan couldn't anticipate.\"\nArin's eyes widened. \"You want to bring human technology to Aquaria? That's never been done before.\"\n\"Exactly why it might work,\" Sophia insisted. \"The Leviathan exists in a magical realm. It understands magic. But science-human technology-works on entirely different principles.\"\nKael swam closer, his interest piqued. \"Like using a weapon your enemy has never seen before.\"\n\"Yes!\" Sophia turned to him gratefully. \"The Leviathan won't know how to counter it.\"\nTharros crossed his arms, his expression troubled. \"You're talking about breaking our oldest law. No surface technology has ever been allowed in Aquaria.\"\n\"Rules that can't bend will break,\" Sophia countered. \"If we don't try something new, there won't be an Aquaria left to protect.\"\nThe weight of her words hung in the water between them. The Heart pulsed weakly, a constant reminder of their dwindling time.\n\"How would we even get this technology?\" Arin asked. \"It's not like we can swim into a human store.\"\nSophia's eyes lit up. \"Dr. Chen. My colleague from the research vessel. He saw the changes in me before I left. He knew something was happening, even if he didn't understand what.\"\n\"You trust this human?\" Tharros asked, skepticism heavy in his voice.\n\"With my life,\" Sophia replied without hesitation. \"He's brilliant and open-minded. If anyone could help without exposing Aquaria to the world, it's him.\"\nKael placed a hand on Tharros's shoulder. \"We've tried everything else. What do we have to lose?\"\nTharros looked around the damaged chamber, at the dimming Heart, at the faces of his companions. His resistance crumbled. \"Fine. But we need safeguards. We can't risk exposing our entire kingdom.\"\n\"I'll create protective wards,\" Arin offered. \"To shield any technology from being detected by others.\"\nSophia nodded gratefully. \"First, I need to contact Dr. Chen. But our normal communication spells won't reach the surface clearly enough.\"\n\"What do you need?\" Kael asked.\nSophia swam to the remnants of their ritual circle, studying the runes. \"I need to modify a communication spell with my scientific knowledge. Create something that bridges both worlds, just like we did with the seed and shard.\"\nThey worked quickly, gathering materials from around the chamber. Sophia sketched new patterns while Arin provided magical components. Tharros contributed energy crystals from his royal stores, and Kael fashioned a frame from pieces of fallen crystal to hold everything together.\nAs they worked, the Heart's pulses became more irregular. Tiny fragments broke away from its surface, dissolving into the water.\n\"We need to hurry,\" Tharros warned.\nSophia connected the final elements of their creation-a fusion of magic and science unlike anything Aquaria had seen before. The merged crystal from the seed and shard sat at its center, powering the entire apparatus.\n\"It's ready,\" she announced, swimming back. \"But there's a risk.\"\n\"What kind of risk?\" Kael asked.\n\"This spell will open a direct channel to the surface. If the Leviathan senses it, it might use that connection to attack the surface world too.\"\nSilence fell over the group as they considered the implications.\n\"We have no choice,\" Tharros finally said. \"The risk to both worlds is too great if we do nothing.\"\nSophia looked at each of her companions. \"Then we do this together. Each of us contributes our strength.\"\nThey positioned themselves around the communication device, hands linked. Energy flowed between them-Tharros's ancient power, Kael's warrior strength, Arin's transformed magic, and Sophia's unique blend of science and supernatural ability.\nThe crystal began to glow, projecting a beam of light upward through the water. Images flickered within the beam-snippets of the surface world, waves crashing against shorelines, the Genesis research vessel bobbing in distant waters.\n\"Focus on Dr. Chen,\" Sophia instructed, closing her eyes to picture her colleague. \"His lab on the east wing. The monitoring station with the blue screens.\"\nThe images shifted, narrowing down to a single location. A man appeared, hunched over displays showing ocean data. Dr. Chen looked tired, his normally neat appearance disheveled, as if he hadn't slept in days.\n\"He's searching for me,\" Sophia whispered, emotion catching in her throat. \"He never gave up.\"\nShe reached toward the image, her fingers brushing the light. \"Chen, it's Sophia. I need your help.\"\nThe man in the projection jerked upright, looking around wildly. \"Sophia? Is that you?\"\n\"Yes! Can you hear me?\"\n\"I-I hear you, but I can't see you.\" Chen adjusted his glasses, searching the room. \"Where are you? Everyone thinks you drowned when that creature escaped.\"\n\"I'm safe, but I don't have much time to explain.\" Sophia glanced at the Heart, where more fragments were breaking away. \"I need equipment. Specific equipment.\"\nAs Sophia began listing what she needed, the light beam flickered. Dark tendrils appeared at its edges, creeping inward.\n\"It's found us,\" Arin warned, her silver patterns flashing in alarm.\n\"Hurry, Sophia,\" Kael urged.\nSophia spoke faster, giving Chen coordinates for a coastal drop point. \"Bring everything in waterproof cases. I'll meet you there in three days. Come alone or don't come at all.\"\n\"This is crazy,\" Chen's voice crackled. \"How do I know it's really you?\"\n\"The night before we captured Tharros, you showed me pictures of your daughter's science fair project-a model of hydrothermal vents that actually produced steam. You said she gets her brains from her mother but her stubbornness from you.\"\nChen's face softened with recognition. \"It is you. But Sophia, what happened? What are you mixed up in?\"\nThe dark tendrils grew thicker, corrupting more of the light beam. The Heart gave a violent pulse, and cracks spread across the chamber floor.\n\"No time!\" Tharros shouted. \"Cut the connection!\"\n\"Three days, Chen!\" Sophia called as the image began to dissolve. \"The fate of two worlds depends on it!\"\nThe beam collapsed in on itself, the crystal dimming as Arin quickly traced protective symbols around it. The darkness receded, but the damage was done. New cracks had appeared in the Heart, pulsing with ominous shadow.\n\"Did he understand? Will he come?\" Kael asked, helping Sophia steady herself.\nSophia stared at the space where Chen's image had been, uncertainty mixing with hope. \"He'll come. He has to.\"\nTharros moved to the Heart, placing his palm against its fractured surface. \"The corruption is spreading faster now. We've accelerated the timeline.\"\nArin joined him, her expression grim. \"Three days may be more than we have.\"\nIn the distance, a low rumble echoed through the tunnels. The corrupted creatures they had pushed back earlier were returning, drawn by the surge of power from their communication spell.\n\"We need to secure this chamber,\" Kael said, drawing his weapon. \"And prepare for the journey to the surface.\"\nAs they moved into defensive positions, Sophia clutched the now-dormant crystal. Their desperate gamble had just made things worse, and yet it was their only hope. In three days, they would either save both worlds or doom them completely.\nShe looked at her companions-dragon king, warrior prince, sea witch-and felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on her like the ocean itself. The surface world remained blissfully unaware of the danger that threatened it. That would soon change.\nAnd somewhere in the darkest trench of the ocean, the Leviathan stirred, sensing its prey moving toward the light.\n Echoes From Above\nThree days seemed like forever when every moment brought them closer to disaster. Sophia paced the fortified chamber they had created near the surface, far enough from Aquaria to protect the kingdom but close enough to maintain their connection to the Heart.",

        "content": "\"You're going to wear a path in the coral,\" Kael joked, though his eyes remained fixed on the tunnel entrance where Arin stood guard.\nSophia stopped pacing and checked the hybrid device again. The merged crystal pulsed with energy, but the connection remained silent. \"We're running out of time. Chen should have reached the drop point by now.\"\nTharros swam to her side, his massive form casting shadows across the coral walls. \"Perhaps your message didn't get through clearly.\"\n\"It got through,\" Sophia insisted. \"Chen understood. He has to come.\"\nThe chamber they'd prepared sat in a hidden underwater cavern, just a hundred feet below the surface. Sunlight filtered down through a crack in the ceiling, creating dancing patterns on the sandy floor. They had brought only essential supplies-magical tools from Arin, weapons from Kael, and energy crystals from Tharros's royal stores.\nSophia adjusted the settings on her creation-a blend of ancient magic and scientific principles that looked like nothing found in either world. Crystals and coral formed its base, while runes and mathematical equations spiraled around its structure.\n\"Let me try again,\" she said, placing her hands on the device. She closed her eyes, focusing on the unique energy signature that was Dr. Chen. She had worked with him for three years; she knew the feel of his mind, the rhythm of his thoughts.\nNothing happened.\n\"The barrier between worlds is stronger than I thought,\" Arin said, swimming over to examine the device. Her silver patterns flashed with curiosity. \"Even with the Heart weakened, the old protections resist being breached.\"\nSophia slammed her fist against the coral wall in frustration. \"We don't have time for this! Every minute we waste, the corruption spreads further.\"\nKael touched her shoulder gently. \"We'll find another way.\"\n\"There is no other way,\" Sophia snapped, then immediately regretted her tone. \"I'm sorry. I'm just-\"\n\"Scared,\" Tharros finished for her. \"We all are.\"\nThe dragon king's admission surprised everyone. He rarely acknowledged fear of any kind.\n\"I may be able to help,\" he continued, swimming closer to the device. \"My connection to Aquaria runs deeper than any magic. The kingdom was built on dragon fire and blood.\"\nSophia looked up at him, hope flickering in her eyes. \"What are you suggesting?\"\n\"A direct link. My power, your knowledge,\" Tharros said. \"The barriers might resist magic alone, but not the bond between mates.\"\nArin's eyes widened. \"That could work. The prophecy speaks of barriers dissolving when the four bonds are united.\"\n\"Will it hurt you?\" Sophia asked Tharros, concern evident in her voice.\nA rare smile crossed the dragon king's face. \"I've survived worse.\"\nHe placed his hands on the device, his palms covering Sophia's. The moment their skin touched, both gasped as energy surged between them. Tharros's eyes glowed with inner fire, and Sophia's skin began to shimmer with faint iridescent scales.\n\"Whoa,\" Kael whispered, backing up a step.\nArin watched in fascination as the energy patterns shifted around the pair. \"Their signatures are synchronizing. I've never seen anything like it.\"\nSophia felt Tharros's ancient power flowing through her, amplifying her own abilities. It was like seeing the world through two sets of eyes simultaneously-the scientist and the dragon, human logic and primal magic.\n\"Now,\" Tharros commanded. \"Reach for your friend.\"\nSophia closed her eyes again, picturing Chen. But this time, she could see more than just his physical form. She could sense the web of connections surrounding him-his love for his daughter, his dedication to science, his worry for his missing colleague.\nThe device hummed, the crystal at its center glowing brighter. A beam of light shot upward, piercing through the water toward the surface. Images flickered within the beam, faster than before-ocean waves, shoreline, cliffs, and finally, a man standing alone on a rocky beach, surrounded by waterproof cases.\n\"Chen!\" Sophia called out.\nThe image sharpened. Dr. Chen stood on the exact coordinates Sophia had given him, scanning the water nervously. He wore a wetsuit and carried a waterproof tablet that displayed scrolling data.\n\"Sophia?\" His voice crackled through the connection. \"I've been here for hours. Where are you?\"\n\"I'm here,\" she answered. \"I can see you.\"\nChen spun around, confused. \"Where? I don't see anyone.\"\n\"I'm not exactly... on the beach,\" Sophia said carefully. She glanced at Tharros, who nodded slightly. \"I'm still in the water.\"\n\"In the water?\" Chen sounded alarmed. \"Sophia, it's been weeks! How are you alive? I've been analyzing the data from that day. The creature that took you-it wasn't like anything we've ever documented.\"\n\"That's because it wasn't a creature,\" Sophia replied. \"It was Tharros. And he's right here with me.\"\nChen's mouth fell open. \"The specimen? He has a name?\"\nTharros snorted, sending a ripple through their connection. \"Specimen,\" he muttered under his breath.\n\"It's complicated,\" Sophia continued. \"But I need those supplies you brought. They're our only hope of stopping something terrible from happening-something that will affect both our worlds.\"\nChen crouched beside his equipment cases. \"You mean the surface and... wherever you are now?\"\n\"Yes. And we don't have much time.\"\nThe scientist in Chen was visibly battling with the impossible situation. \"This defies everything I know, Sophia. You're asking me to just hand over equipment worth millions without explanation? How do I even get it to you?\"\nKael swam forward. \"Can he hear all of us?\"\nSophia nodded.\n\"Then let me speak to him,\" the warrior said. He positioned himself next to Sophia, careful not to break the connection maintained by her and Tharros. \"Dr. Chen, my name is Kael. I'm a friend of Sophia's. I know this is difficult to believe, but your world stands on the edge of destruction if we fail.\"\nChen's eyes widened at the new voice. \"Who else is down there with you?\"\n\"Friends,\" Sophia answered simply. \"Friends who are trying to save everyone.\"\n\"From what?\" Chen pressed.\nSophia hesitated, then decided a partial truth was better than nothing. \"A form of corruption that's spreading through the ocean. It's already killing coral and marine life, but it's going to get worse. Much worse.\"\nChen's scientific interest was piqued. \"Is that connected to the strange readings we've been getting? Dark zones where nothing lives anymore, spreading outward from deep ocean trenches?\"\nSophia and Tharros exchanged alarmed looks. The corruption was advancing faster than they'd thought.\n\"Yes,\" Sophia confirmed. \"And it will reach coastal areas within days if we can't stop it.\"\nThe connection flickered, dark tendrils appearing at the edges of the light beam.\n\"It's found us again,\" Arin warned, her patterns flashing urgently. \"We need to disconnect.\"\n\"Chen, listen carefully,\" Sophia said quickly. \"Put the equipment in the water. We'll retrieve it. Then go back to the Genesis. Watch for signs of the corruption spreading. If we fail, you'll need to warn everyone.\"\nChen moved toward the water's edge, dragging one of the cases. \"Sophia, wait! How will I know if you succeeded? How can I help you more directly?\"\nThe connection deteriorated further, Chen's image breaking apart.\n\"Trust me,\" Sophia called out as Tharros pulled her hands from the device, breaking the connection before the corruption could trace it back to them.\nThe light beam vanished, leaving the chamber in semi-darkness.\n\"Did he understand?\" Kael asked.\nSophia nodded, her limbs shaking from the power that had flowed through her. \"He'll leave the equipment. But we need to move fast.\"\nTharros looked equally drained, his normally imposing presence diminished. \"That connection... it revealed something new between us.\"\n\"I felt it too,\" Sophia admitted. \"Like we were thinking with one mind.\"\nArin examined them both with knowing eyes. \"The prophecy spoke of four becoming one. Perhaps this is the beginning of that transformation.\"\nBefore they could discuss it further, a rumble shook the cavern. Small fragments of rock fell from the ceiling, splashing into the water.\n\"What was that?\" Kael asked, weapon already drawn.\nTharros's expression darkened. \"The Leviathan. It's rising toward the surface.\"\n\"But why?\" Sophia looked upward toward the crack of sunlight. \"What could it want up there?\"\n\"Not what,\" Arin said grimly. \"Who. It sensed our connection to Chen.\"\nHorror dawned on Sophia's face. \"We've led it straight to him.\"\nKael was already gathering their essentials. \"Then we need to get to those supplies and reach the surface before it does.\"\nAs they prepared to leave, Sophia cast one last look at the device that had connected them to the surface world. For a brief moment, she had bridged the gap between her old life and new. Now both worlds hung in the balance.\nAnd somewhere above them, unaware of the danger swimming up from the depths, Dr. Chen waited by the shore, his scientific mind struggling to comprehend a truth bigger than anything he had ever imagined.\n Trust or Betray\nDr. James Chen stood at the rocky shoreline long after Sophia's voice had faded. The waves crashed against the waterproof cases at his feet, spray hitting his face. He wiped the saltwater from his glasses, wondering if he had imagined the entire conversation.\nBut the equipment cases were real. And Sophia-his brilliant colleague who everyone believed was dead-had somehow spoken to him from beneath the waves.\n\"This is insane,\" he muttered, pushing one of the heavy cases deeper into the water. The others followed, bobbing briefly before sinking beneath the surface. Part of him wanted to dive in after them, to follow wherever they went. Instead, he backed away, checking that no one was watching from the cliffs above.\nHis phone buzzed in the pocket of his wetsuit. Chen flinched, then pulled it out with trembling fingers. The caller ID read: \"Director Harmon - ORI.\"\nChen took a deep breath before answering. \"Dr. Chen speaking.\"\n\"Where are you?\" Director Harmon's voice was sharp with impatience. \"You were supposed to check in hours ago.\"\n\"Sorry, sir. I've been running tests on the coastal waters. The anomalies are spreading faster than we predicted.\"\nA heavy sigh came through the line. \"That's precisely why we need you back at the Genesis. We're planning a full recovery operation.\"\nChen's heart skipped a beat. \"Recovery of what, exactly?\"",

        "content": "\"Everything. The specimen. Our equipment. And...\" Harmon paused. \"Closure on Dr. Rodriguez. It's been weeks, James. The board wants to declare her officially lost at sea.\"\nThe words hit Chen like a physical blow. How could he tell them Sophia was alive without revealing what he'd just experienced?\n\"I'll be back by nightfall,\" he promised, his mind racing. \"But sir, about those anomalies-the dark zones. I think they might be connected to the escaped specimen.\"\n\"All the more reason to recapture it,\" Harmon said firmly. \"We're bringing in specialized equipment. If that creature is causing environmental damage, we have a duty to contain it.\"\nChen closed his eyes. Specialized equipment meant weapons. Harpoons. Tactical divers.\n\"I understand, sir. I'll return right away.\"\nAfter hanging up, Chen stared out at the ocean. Somewhere below, Sophia was alive. With friends. With the creature-Tharros-they had captured. They were trying to stop something terrible from happening, something that might explain the spreading dead zones in the ocean.\nAnd he had just helped them while lying to his boss.\n\"What have I done?\" he whispered.\nThe drive back to the harbor took forty minutes. Each mile increased the weight of his decision. By the time Chen parked his rental car and boarded the small boat that would take him to the Genesis research vessel, doubt gnawed at him like a hungry shark.\nThe Genesis loomed ahead, its sleek white hull gleaming in the afternoon sun. Built for ocean research, the vessel housed state-of-the-art laboratories where Chen had worked alongside Sophia for three years. They had made discoveries, published papers, built careers on their shared passion for understanding the deep.\nNow that partnership had led him to the edge of professional suicide.\nAs Chen climbed aboard, three people waited for him on deck. Director Harmon stood front and center, flanked by Dr. Rivera from Marine Biology and a man Chen didn't recognize-tall, military posture, dressed in black despite the heat.\n\"Dr. Chen,\" Harmon greeted him with a firm handshake. \"This is Agent Kramer from the Institute's Security Division.\"\nChen nodded, keeping his expression neutral despite the alarm bells ringing in his head. The Oceanic Research Institute had a security division?\n\"Agent Kramer is coordinating our recovery operation,\" Harmon continued. \"He's brought specialized assets to help us locate and contain the specimen.\"\n\"Great,\" Chen managed, forcing a smile. \"When do we start?\"\n\"Tomorrow at dawn,\" Rivera said, already scrolling through data on her tablet. \"We've been tracking unusual energy signatures that might lead us to the specimen. Tell me about these new anomalies you've been monitoring.\"\nChen hesitated, aware of Kramer watching him closely. Everything he said now would direct their search. If he told the truth, he might lead them straight to Sophia. If he lied...\n\"The dark zones are spreading in a specific pattern,\" he said, choosing his words carefully. \"They originate from deep trenches and move outward. But there's something odd-they seem to avoid certain areas.\"\n\"Show me,\" Rivera demanded, handing him her tablet.\nChen brought up the map, then deliberately marked locations far from where he'd met Sophia. \"These regions remain untouched. I think the specimen is territorial, staying away from these underwater structures.\"\nKramer stepped closer, studying the map. \"What structures? There's nothing in our databases about buildings at these coordinates.\"\n\"Not buildings,\" Chen improvised. \"Natural formations. Unusual coral arrangements that emit electromagnetic fields. They might be repelling whatever is causing the dark zones.\"\nRivera looked skeptical. \"I've never heard of coral with electromagnetic properties.\"\n\"That's why I was running tests today,\" Chen said, adding details to his lie. \"I think we should focus our search here.\" He pointed to an area in the opposite direction from the drop point.\n\"Interesting theory,\" Harmon said slowly. \"We'll consider it when planning tomorrow's operation.\"\nThe meeting continued in the ship's conference room. Chen provided more fabricated data, painting a picture that would send the recovery team miles from where Sophia might be. With each falsehood, his stomach twisted tighter.\nNight fell. Chen retreated to his cabin, locking the door behind him. He sat on the edge of his bed, head in his hands. What was he doing? His entire career was built on scientific integrity, on following evidence wherever it led. Now he was deliberately misleading his colleagues.\nBut Sophia's words echoed in his mind: \"If we fail, you'll need to warn everyone.\"\nChen moved to his desk and opened his laptop. If he couldn't tell the truth now, he could at least prepare for the worst. He began compiling data on the spreading dark zones, documenting their growth rate and environmental impact. Then he created a secure file with everything he knew-or suspected-about what was happening beneath the waves.\nA knock on his door made him jump.\n\"Dr. Chen?\" It was Kramer's voice. \"May I have a word?\"\nChen quickly closed his laptop. \"Just a moment.\"\nHe took a deep breath, then opened the door. Kramer stood in the hallway, his expression unreadable.\n\"May I come in?\" he asked.\nChen stepped aside, pulse racing. Had Kramer seen through his lies?\nThe security agent closed the door behind him. \"I wanted to speak with you privately about tomorrow's operation.\"\n\"What about it?\"\n\"I believe you're withholding information,\" Kramer said bluntly. \"The Institute has invested millions in this project. The specimen's escape and Dr. Rodriguez's disappearance represent a significant loss.\"\nChen maintained eye contact despite his churning stomach. \"I want to find answers as much as anyone.\"\n\"Do you?\" Kramer moved closer. \"Because your behavior today suggests otherwise. Your data doesn't match our satellite readings. You've been making unauthorized trips to coastal locations. And now you're suggesting we search in areas that contradict our best intelligence.\"\n\"My methods may be unconventional-\"\n\"Stop.\" Kramer held up a hand. \"I'm not here to accuse. I'm here to offer you a choice.\"\nChen blinked in surprise. \"What kind of choice?\"\n\"Tell me what you know-everything you know-and I'll ensure you're protected when this operation reveals the truth. Or continue this charade, and find yourself facing consequences beyond mere termination.\"\nThe threat hung in the air between them. Chen thought of Sophia, of the urgency in her voice. Of Tharros and the unnamed friends trying to stop a disaster. Of dark zones spreading through the ocean, killing everything in their path.\nHe thought of his daughter, who loved the ocean and trusted her father to protect it.\n\"You're right,\" Chen said finally. \"I haven't been entirely forthcoming.\"\nKramer nodded, a hint of satisfaction crossing his face.\n\"The anomalies are more serious than we've acknowledged,\" Chen continued. \"They're not just environmental-they're changing. Evolving. I've been tracking patterns that suggest we have less time than anyone realizes.\"\n\"And the specimen? Dr. Rodriguez?\"\nChen met Kramer's gaze steadily. \"I believe they're connected to whatever is happening. But not in the way you think.\"\nHe turned to his laptop, opening the file he'd been working on. \"This is everything I know. The real data. The true locations of the dark zones. And my hypothesis about what's causing them.\"\nKramer leaned over his shoulder, studying the screen with growing concern. \"This can't be right. According to this, half the ocean could be dead within weeks.\"\n\"That's what I've been trying to tell everyone,\" Chen said, seizing the opening. \"But no one wants to hear that we're facing an ecological collapse unlike anything in recorded history. It's easier to focus on recapturing one specimen than addressing the real threat.\"\nThe security agent straightened, his military demeanor slipping. \"If this is accurate, we need to redirect tomorrow's operation entirely.\"\n\"Yes,\" Chen agreed. \"Away from hunting the specimen and toward understanding what's happening to our oceans.\"\nKramer was silent for a long moment, weighing options. Finally, he nodded. \"I'll speak with Director Harmon. This changes everything.\"\nAfter Kramer left, Chen sank into his chair, trembling with relief and residual fear. He hadn't exactly lied-the dark zones were spreading exactly as his data showed. He'd simply omitted his communication with Sophia and the true nature of the threat.\nHe'd bought them time. A day, maybe two, while the Institute recalibrated its approach based on his environmental warnings rather than pursuing Sophia and Tharros.\nChen looked out his cabin window at the dark ocean. \"I hope you know what you're doing, Sophia,\" he whispered. \"I've just risked everything to help you.\"\nSomewhere in the depths below, unseen by human eyes, a massive shadow moved through the water. It sensed the vessel above, filled with warm bodies and machinery. It sensed the lingering connection to its prey. But most of all, it sensed the approaching sunrise, when humans would enter its domain, unknowingly offering themselves as new hosts for the spreading corruption.\nThe Leviathan rose slowly toward the surface, patient in its hunger. Morning would come soon enough.\n Messengers Between Worlds\nThe morning sun blazed across the Genesis research vessel. Dr. Chen paced his cabin, checking his watch for the fifth time. His conversation with Agent Kramer had bought precious time, but how much?\nThrough the porthole, he watched crew members preparing dive equipment. They moved with military precision that seemed out of place on a research vessel.\nChen's phone buzzed. A text message appeared from an unknown number: \"We need your help. Tonight. Same spot. Bring what you can.\"\nHis heart raced. Sophia was reaching out again. After everything he'd risked yesterday, she still needed more.\n\"What am I doing?\" he whispered.\nA knock startled him. Chen shoved the phone into his pocket as Dr. Rivera entered.\n\"James, we're briefing in ten minutes,\" she said. \"Kramer's team is rethinking the operation based on your environmental data.\"\nChen nodded, forcing a calm he didn't feel. \"Good. Those dark zones are the real priority.\"\n\"Agreed. But something else is bothering me.\" Rivera narrowed her eyes. \"The equipment request you filed this morning. Copper wiring, crystal resonators, modified sonar equipment? What exactly are you building?\"\n\"A detection system,\" Chen replied, the lie coming easier now. \"If these anomalies are electromagnetic as I suspect, we need specialized equipment to map them properly.\"",

        "content": "Rivera studied him for a moment. \"Director Harmon approved it. Materials will arrive by helicopter this afternoon.\" She paused at the door. \"You've changed, James. Since Sophia disappeared.\"\nAfter she left, Chen released a shaky breath. He had hours, not days, to gather what Sophia needed.\nBeneath the waves, Sophia Rodriguez floated in the healing chamber of Aquaria's palace. The water glowed with soft blue light, easing the pain from yesterday's battle.\nShe wasn't alone. Tharros's massive dragon form curled protectively around the chamber's perimeter. His scales rippled with silver-blue patterns that matched the healing waters.\n\"You're thinking about the surface again,\" Tharros rumbled, his voice resonating through the water. \"About your friend.\"\nSophia didn't deny it. \"Chen risked everything to help us. And we'll need him again if we're going to stop what's coming.\"\n\"You trust him too easily,\" Tharros said. His massive head swung closer, golden eyes studying her face. \"Humans have betrayed us before.\"\n\"I was human three weeks ago,\" Sophia reminded him, reaching out to touch his snout. The scales were warm beneath her fingers. \"Not all of us are enemies.\"\nTharros huffed, sending bubbles swirling around them. \"You were never just human, Sophia.\"\nThe chamber doors opened with a rush of water. Kael entered, his warrior's armor gleaming. Fresh scars crossed his chest where the Leviathan had struck him.\n\"The Council is meeting,\" he announced. \"Arin's spells confirm what we feared. The dark zones are spreading faster.\"\nSophia pushed away from the healing waters, her body still aching. \"Then we need to move tonight.\"\nKael's expression darkened. \"It's too dangerous. You nearly died yesterday.\"\n\"We all nearly died,\" Sophia corrected him. \"And we'll certainly die if we do nothing.\"\nTharros transformed in a swirl of magic, his dragon form condensing into his human appearance. Even in this form, power radiated from him like heat from fire.\n\"The witch agrees with Sophia,\" he said reluctantly. \"We need technology from the surface. Things that cannot be created with our magic.\"\nKael crossed his arms, the motion revealing more battle scars. \"And if this Dr. Chen betrays us? If he brings the Institute's hunters instead?\"\n\"He won't,\" Sophia said with more confidence than she felt. \"I know him.\"\nThe afternoon dragged with agonizing slowness for Chen. He attended briefings, nodded at the right moments, and volunteered to supervise the equipment delivery when the helicopter arrived.\nAgent Kramer found him on the helipad as crates were being unloaded.\n\"Impressive setup you've requested,\" Kramer said, examining the manifest. \"Most of this isn't standard oceanographic equipment.\"\nChen kept his voice steady. \"Standard equipment doesn't detect non-standard phenomena.\"\n\"You believe that's what we're dealing with? Something... beyond conventional science?\"\nChen met Kramer's gaze. \"Three weeks ago, I would have laughed at the suggestion. Now? I've seen too much to dismiss anything.\"\nKramer's expression remained unreadable. \"Director Harmon has authorized your independent operation tonight. Take whatever you need, but maintain hourly radio contact.\"\nChen blinked in surprise. \"Independent operation?\"\n\"Your theory about the electromagnetic anomalies warrants investigation,\" Kramer said smoothly. \"A small boat, minimal equipment, just you. Less disruption to potential readings.\"\nA trap? Or unexpected luck? Chen couldn't tell, but he nodded gratefully. \"Thank you. I'll report anything I find.\"\nAs Kramer walked away, Chen's stomach twisted with guilt and fear. The man was giving him exactly what he needed to help Sophia, while Chen planned to betray his trust.\nThe council chamber of Aquaria stretched into a vast dome, its walls alive with coral and crystal. Sophia stood before the gathered leaders, still unaccustomed to how they looked to her for answers.\nArin floated beside her, her sea witch's robes swirling in magical currents. \"The barriers between worlds are weakening,\" she told the council. \"The Leviathan was only the first sign.\"\n\"The corruption will follow,\" Sophia continued. \"Not just in our waters, but everywhere. The dark zones spreading on the surface are only the beginning.\"\nAn elder from the Dolphin Pods clicked in distress. \"Your proposed solution is dangerous. Bringing surface technology into Aquaria violates our oldest laws.\"\n\"Laws made before the corruption returned,\" Tharros countered, his voice echoing with royal authority. \"Before the prophecy of four was fulfilled.\"\nSophia touched the markings on her skin, still new and sometimes painful. The symbols that connected her to Tharros, to Kael, and to Arin pulsed with shared energy.\n\"I'm not asking permission,\" she said finally. \"I'm telling you what must be done. Tonight, we meet my friend at the surface. Tomorrow, we begin building a device that combines your magic with human science. It's our only chance.\"\nThe council erupted in argument, but Sophia had already turned away. Her decision was made.\nNight fell over the ocean. Chen piloted the small research boat away from the Genesis, the requested equipment secured in waterproof cases. His hourly radio check had just been completed. The next wasn't due for sixty minutes.\nThe coordinates from Sophia's message took him to the same rocky shoreline. Waves crashed against the hull as he cut the engine and dropped anchor.\n\"I must be insane,\" he muttered, checking that no one had followed.\nThe water around the boat began to glow. Soft blue light spiraled upward from the depths, illuminating the night. Chen held his breath as three figures broke the surface.\nSophia came first, but not the Sophia he remembered. Her skin shimmered with iridescent patterns. Her eyes reflected the moonlight like a cat's. Behind her rose a man with an aura of barely contained power, then another whose muscled body bore the marks of recent battle.\n\"James,\" Sophia called, her voice carrying over the waves. \"Thank you for coming.\"\nChen swallowed hard. \"I brought what you asked for. But Sophia, they're getting suspicious. I can't keep doing this.\"\n\"You won't have to,\" she promised. \"After tonight, everything changes.\"\nThe powerful man beside her spoke, his voice rumbling like distant thunder. \"You've taken a great risk, surface dweller. Aquaria will remember.\"\nChen began lowering the equipment into the water. \"Will you at least tell me what we're building?\"\n\"A bridge,\" Sophia answered. \"Between magic and science. Between their world and ours.\"\nAs the last case disappeared beneath the waves, Chen felt a chill that had nothing to do with the night air.\n\"Sophia, what's really happening out there? What are these dark zones?\"\nHer expression grew grim. \"Death, James. A corruption that consumes everything. And it's looking for a way to the surface.\"\nMiles below, in the crushing darkness of the deepest trench, something stirred. The Leviathan, wounded but healing, sensed the exchange above. It felt the magic flowing between worlds, the barrier thinning where they met.\nThe corruption that had once used the Leviathan as a host now sought a new way through. It reached out, tasting the weakness where ocean and air met, where magic and science mingled.\nAnd it began to climb toward the light.\n  Fire Meets Shore\nDawn broke over Aquaria, painting the coral spires with golden light that filtered through the waves. In the royal chamber, Tharros paced like a caged animal. His footsteps left small scorch marks on the floor, steam rising where his heated skin touched water.\n\"It's decided,\" he growled, his voice echoing off crystal walls. \"I will go to the surface.\"\nSophia looked up from the strange device she was assembling. Her fingers worked quickly, connecting copper wires to the crystal resonators Chen had provided. The magic flowing through her veins made the crystals pulse with blue light.\n\"You haven't been to the surface in centuries,\" she reminded him. \"Everything has changed.\"\nTharros's eyes flashed golden. \"The air is still air. The land is still land.\"\n\"And humans are still everywhere,\" Kael said, entering the chamber. His warrior's armor gleamed, fresh battle scars visible across his arms. \"With cameras and weapons and curiosity that will endanger us all.\"\nArin floated in behind him, her sea witch's robes swirling around her slim form. \"The mer prince speaks truth, my king. Your dragon form cannot be hidden from modern eyes.\"\nTharros turned to face them, his anger making the water around him bubble. \"You think I plan to announce myself? To fly over their cities breathing fire?\"\n\"We think you haven't thought this through,\" Sophia said gently, setting down her tools. She swam to him, placing a hand on his chest. The markings on her skin glowed where they touched him. \"The surface isn't what you remember.\"\n\"I don't care what it's become,\" Tharros snapped. \"The corruption is spreading. Your friend Chen cannot transport what we need alone. Someone must go, and it must be me.\"\nKael moved closer, his hand resting on the hilt of his trident. \"Then I will accompany you.\"\n\"No.\" Tharros's voice was final. \"You and Arin must remain here. The barriers weaken by the hour. If they fall while we're gone...\"\nHe didn't need to finish. They all knew what would happen if the magical shields protecting Aquaria collapsed. The corruption would pour in, consuming everything.\n\"Then I'll go with Tharros,\" Sophia said. The room fell silent as three pairs of eyes turned to her. \"I know the surface. I can help him blend in, navigate the human world.\"\nArin shook her head, worry clear in her ancient eyes. \"The bond between you is strongest. If you both leave, Kael and I may not have enough power to maintain the barriers.\"\n\"And if we stay, we lose our only chance to complete this device,\" Sophia countered, pointing to her work. \"We need components that exist only on land.\"\nA tense silence filled the chamber. Kael and Arin exchanged glances, a wordless communication born from centuries of friendship. Tharros watched them, his expression unreadable.\n\"There's another problem,\" Kael finally said. \"The surface air. Sophia has adapted to water, but returning to air might harm her.\"\nSophia hadn't considered this. Her transformation had been rapid, her human lungs replaced by gills that filtered oxygen from water. Could she still breathe air?\nArin glided forward, her fingers weaving a pattern in the water. \"I can cast a protection spell. It will allow her to breathe both air and water for three days.\"\n\"Three days,\" Tharros repeated. \"Then that's how long we have.\"\n\"Not enough time,\" Kael argued. \"The journey alone-\"\n\"Will be swift if I fly,\" Tharros cut in. \"My dragon form can carry Sophia over open water, away from human eyes. We'll only appear human once we reach land.\"\nSophia felt a flutter of fear mixed with excitement. She had seen Tharros transform, but never ridden on his back. The thought was both terrifying and thrilling.\n\"The risk is too great,\" Kael insisted, moving to stand between Sophia and Tharros. His protective stance made Tharros's eyes narrow dangerously.\n\"The risk of doing nothing is greater,\" Sophia said, placing a calming hand on Kael's arm. The markings connecting them pulsed with shared emotion. \"You know I'm right.\"\nKael's resistance crumbled under her touch. He stepped aside, but his face remained troubled. \"Three days. If you're not back by then...\"\n\"We'll be back,\" Tharros promised. \"With everything we need.\"\nThey prepared quickly. Arin's magic wrapped around Sophia like a second skin, invisible but strong. Tharros changed his appearance, dulling the royal markings that covered his human form. They couldn't disappear entirely-they were part of him-but they faded to what might pass for unusual tattoos.\nIn the great dome at the top of the palace, they gathered to say goodbye. Sophia embraced Kael, feeling his strong arms tighten around her.\n\"Come back to me,\" he whispered. \"To us.\"\n\"I will,\" she promised. \"Keep the barriers strong until then.\"\nArin approached next, pressing her forehead to Sophia's in the traditional witch's blessing. \"The spell will hold for three days and nights,\" she said. \"Not a moment longer.\"\nSophia nodded, swallowing the lump in her throat. In just weeks, these people had become her family, her home. Leaving them felt wrong, even if necessary.\nTharros stood apart, his body already beginning to change. Scales appeared along his arms, his eyes growing more golden by the second.\n\"It's time,\" he said, his voice deeper than before.",

        "content": "A current of water swept through the dome as the magical barrier thinned, creating a path to the surface. Tharros completed his transformation in a burst of blue light. Where a man had stood moments before, a massive dragon now floated, silver-blue scales gleaming. His long body coiled through the water, powerful wings unfurling.\nSophia's breath caught. No matter how many times she saw it, Tharros's true form was magnificent.\nHe swam to her side, lowering his massive head. Climb on, his voice rumbled in her mind.\nWith one last look at Kael and Arin, Sophia pulled herself onto Tharros's back, finding a secure position between his shoulder blades. His scales were warm beneath her hands.\nHold tight, he warned. The transition will be... uncomfortable.\nBefore she could ask what he meant, Tharros surged upward. They shot through the barrier, water rushing past in a deafening roar. Sophia clung to him, her heart pounding as they accelerated toward the surface.\nThey broke through in an explosion of spray. Sophia gasped, the air burning her lungs for a moment before Arin's spell adjusted her body. Tharros didn't pause-his wings spread wide, catching the wind and lifting them into the sky.\nThe sensation was unlike anything Sophia had ever experienced. The ocean fell away beneath them, becoming a vast blue expanse. Wind whipped her hair as Tharros climbed higher, his powerful wings beating steadily.\nAre you alright? his voice asked in her mind.\n\"Yes,\" she called back, laughing despite their dangerous mission. \"It's amazing!\"\nShe felt his pleasure at her enjoyment, the emotion flowing through their connection. For a moment, they shared the pure joy of flight, of freedom.\nBut as they soared toward the distant coastline, reality returned. They had three days to find what they needed and return to Aquaria. Three days to build a device that might save both worlds.\nWhere to? Tharros asked, banking slightly to follow the shoreline.\nSophia thought of Chen, of the Oceanic Research Institute, of the equipment they would need to complete their work.\n\"Northeast,\" she directed. \"There's a private research facility owned by the Institute. It has everything we need.\"\nAnd guards? Security?\nShe nodded, knowing he could feel her answer. \"We'll need to be careful. Very careful.\"\nBelow them, the ocean darkened in patches-the spreading corruption visible even from above. In the distance, coastal lights winked on as evening approached.\nThree days, Tharros reminded her, his thoughts tinged with worry.\n\"It'll be enough,\" Sophia said with more confidence than she felt. \"It has to be.\"\nAs they flew, neither noticed the small boat following their shadow across the waves. On its deck, Agent Kramer tracked their movement through high-powered binoculars, speaking quietly into a satellite phone.\n\"Target confirmed,\" he said. \"Dr. Rodriguez is alive. And she's not alone.\"\n Spotted in the Shadows\nNight wrapped around Tharros and Sophia like a blanket as they soared above the dark ocean. The moon peeked through clouds, casting silver light on Tharros's scales. They had been flying for hours, following the coastline north.\n\"We need to land soon,\" Sophia said, patting the dragon's neck. Her legs ached from clinging to his back, and the chill wind had numbed her face. \"There's a cove ahead that should be empty this time of night.\"\nTharros dipped his massive head in agreement. I sense fewer humans there, his voice rumbled in her mind.\nHe banked toward the shoreline, descending in a wide spiral. The small cove appeared below, surrounded by rocky cliffs and thick forest. Perfect for hiding a dragon.\nWhat they didn't see was the small fishing boat anchored in the shadows of the cliff.\nTharros glided lower, wings spread wide to catch the night air. They were fifty feet above the water when a spotlight suddenly blazed from the fishing boat, catching them in its harsh beam.\n\"Dragon!\" a voice shouted from below. \"It's a dragon!\"\nSophia's heart jumped into her throat. \"Dive!\" she yelled, clutching Tharros's scales.\nTharros folded his wings and plunged toward the water. The spotlight tried to follow but lost them as they hit the surface with a massive splash. Cold water engulfed Sophia, but Arin's spell allowed her to breathe as they sank beneath the waves.\nThey saw us, Tharros's angry voice filled her mind. Your surface world has too many eyes.\n\"We need to swim underwater to the shore,\" Sophia urged. \"Quick, before they call for help.\"\nTharros cut through the water like a missile, his powerful tail propelling them toward the cove. Above, they could see flashlight beams dancing across the water's surface as the fishermen searched for them.\nThey reached the rocky shoreline and found a small hidden inlet flanked by boulders. Tharros surfaced cautiously, keeping most of his body underwater.\n\"You need to transform,\" Sophia whispered urgently. \"They'll be looking for a dragon, not people.\"\nTharros growled, a sound that sent bubbles rushing to the surface. Transform where? The shore is too exposed.\nHe was right. The moonlight illuminated the entire cove. Any movement would be visible from the fishing boat, which was now motoring slowly around the bay, its spotlight sweeping the water.\n\"Behind those rocks,\" Sophia pointed to a cluster of boulders that created a small shadow. \"I'll go first and check.\"\nShe slipped from his back and swam silently to the shore, grateful for her new abilities that made moving through water effortless. When she reached the rocks, she peered around them. A small patch of beach lay hidden from view of the open water.\nSophia waved Tharros over. The dragon moved with surprising stealth for his size, barely causing a ripple as he glided toward her.\nThe moment Tharros reached the shadow of the rocks, his body began to glow. The transformation was quicker this time, his massive form shrinking and reshaping into human appearance. Within seconds, a man stood beside Sophia, water streaming from his skin.\n\"That was too close,\" he growled, his golden eyes reflecting moonlight.\nDistant sirens wailed along the coast. The fishermen had called for help.\n\"We need to move fast,\" Sophia said, peering around the rocks. \"They'll have Coast Guard boats here soon, maybe even helicopters.\"\nTharros scowled. \"This was a mistake. We should return to Aquaria.\"\n\"We can't,\" Sophia reminded him. \"The device needs those components. Three days, remember?\"\nShe pulled herself onto the shore, her wet clothes clinging to her skin. The air felt strange in her lungs after weeks underwater. Arin's spell worked, but the sensation remained odd.\nTharros followed, moving with the grace of a predator despite his human form. His \"tattoos\" gleamed faintly in the darkness.\n\"Which way?\" he asked.\nSophia oriented herself, finding the North Star. \"The research facility is about ten miles up the coast. But we can't walk along the beach - too exposed.\"\n\"Then we go through the forest,\" Tharros decided, already heading toward the tree line.\nThe woods were dark and dense, branches scratching at their faces as they pushed through. Sophia stumbled over roots and rocks, but Tharros moved with confidence, his eyesight perfect even in darkness.\nBehind them, the sirens grew louder. Flashing lights reflected off the clouds above the cove.\n\"They're taking this seriously,\" Sophia murmured. \"A dragon sighting will draw attention.\"\n\"Let them look,\" Tharros said. \"By the time they organize a proper search, we'll be far from here.\"\nThey hiked for an hour, climbing away from the coast and deeper into the forest. When they reached a small clearing, Sophia paused, catching her breath.\n\"I need to contact Chen,\" she said. \"He can help us reach the facility.\"\nFrom her pocket, she pulled out a small waterproof case containing a phone - one of the items Chen had delivered to them. She powered it on, the screen casting blue light across her face.\nTharros watched with suspicion. \"These devices can be traced.\"\n\"I know,\" Sophia said. \"But we don't have a choice.\"\nShe typed a quick message to Chen: Emergency. Plan changed. Dragon spotted. Need extraction from Hawk's Point Forest. Two hours.\nThe response came almost immediately: Satellite reports confirm sighting. Military mobilizing. Stay hidden. Will find you.\nSophia's stomach tightened with fear. \"We've got trouble. Big trouble.\"\nTharros leaned over her shoulder to see the screen. \"What is 'military mobilizing'?\"\n\"It means armed humans with weapons and technology designed to find us,\" Sophia explained. \"The kind that even a dragon should fear.\"\nFor the first time, uncertainty flickered across Tharros's face. \"Our mission becomes more complicated.\"\n\"We need to keep moving,\" Sophia said, turning off the phone. \"Chen will meet us at Hawk's Point - it's about two miles north of here.\"\nThey set off again, moving faster now. The forest grew thicker, providing better cover. In the distance, they heard the thump of helicopter rotors.\n\"They're searching from the air,\" Sophia whispered.\nTharros looked up, his expression darkening. \"If they force me to transform again...\"\n\"They won't,\" Sophia assured him, though she wasn't certain. \"We stay hidden, meet Chen, get to the facility.\"\nAs they walked, Tharros moved closer to Sophia, his hand brushing against hers. \"This world has changed more than I expected,\" he admitted quietly. \"So many humans, so much technology.\"\n\"It's not all bad,\" Sophia said. \"Humans have created amazing things too.\"\n\"Yet they destroy your oceans,\" he countered. \"The same oceans that hide Aquaria.\"\nShe couldn't argue with that. \"Some of us are trying to fix things. That's why I became a marine biologist in the first place.\"\nThe sound of voices made them freeze. Flashlight beams cut through the trees ahead.\n\"Search party,\" Sophia whispered, pulling Tharros behind a fallen log.\nThey crouched in the shadows as the lights came closer. Through the underbrush, they could see figures in uniform moving through the trees.\n\"Spread out,\" a voice commanded. \"The thermal imaging showed something large moving this way.\"\nTharros tensed beside her, his skin growing warm. Sophia placed a warning hand on his arm, feeling the scales beginning to emerge beneath her fingers.\n\"Don't,\" she breathed. \"If you transform, they'll see you for sure.\"",

        "content": "The dragon king fought to control himself, his breathing heavy as the search party moved closer. Sophia could feel his rage building, the ancient instinct to fight rather than hide.\n\"Trust me,\" she whispered, gripping his hand tightly. Their markings glowed softly where they touched, a connection that ran deeper than skin.\nTharros looked at her, golden eyes meeting hers. Slowly, the heat in his skin subsided.\nThe searchers passed within twenty feet of their hiding place, sweeping flashlights across the forest floor. For heart-stopping moments, a beam lingered near their log, then moved on. Gradually, the voices and lights faded into the distance.\n\"They'll be back,\" Sophia said, rising cautiously. \"With better equipment. We need to reach Hawk's Point before they establish a perimeter.\"\nThey ran now, no longer concerned with stealth. Speed mattered more than silence. Branches whipped their faces, roots threatened to trip them, but they pressed on.\nWhen they finally reached the edge of Hawk's Point - a rocky outcropping overlooking the ocean - dawn was breaking over the horizon. The sky turned purple and pink, revealing a breathtaking view of the coastline.\nAnd dozens of boats patrolling the waters.\n\"This is worse than I feared,\" Sophia said, scanning the scene below. Coast Guard vessels, fishing boats, even what looked like a naval ship farther out. \"They've mobilized everything.\"\nTharros stood tall beside her, his eyes reflecting the rising sun. \"Where is your friend Chen?\"\n\"I don't know,\" Sophia admitted, fear crawling up her spine. \"He should be here.\"\nA twig snapped behind them. They whirled around to find themselves facing not Chen, but Agent Kramer, holding a high-powered rifle pointed directly at Tharros.\n\"Dr. Rodriguez,\" Kramer said calmly. \"I've been looking for you.\"\nTharros growled, his human disguise beginning to slip as scales rippled across his skin.\n\"Please don't,\" Kramer said, adjusting his aim. \"This weapon is designed specifically for creatures like him. The Institute has been studying dragons longer than you know.\"\nSophia stepped between them. \"Kramer, listen to me. You don't understand what's happening.\"\n\"I understand perfectly,\" he replied. \"You've betrayed your species for him.\" He nodded toward Tharros. \"The question is why?\"\nBefore she could answer, a blinding light flashed from the trees beyond Kramer. The agent stiffened, then crumpled to the ground, revealing Dr. Chen standing behind him with some kind of electrical device.\n\"Sorry I'm late,\" Chen said breathlessly. \"Had to avoid your admirers.\" He gestured to the unconscious Kramer. \"He won't stay down long. My car's this way. Hurry!\"\nAs they raced after Chen, Sophia glanced back at the ocean. Beyond the boats and the search parties, she could see patches of darkness spreading beneath the surface - the corruption growing, reaching for the shore.\nThey had two days left to save both worlds, and now all of humanity was hunting them.\n  The World Watches\nSophia's phone buzzed in Chen's car as they sped along the coastal highway. She glanced at the screen and her stomach dropped.\n\"It's already trending,\" she whispered, showing the device to Tharros. \"DragonSighting is number one worldwide.\"\nTharros leaned closer, his golden eyes narrowing at the small screen. \"Your kind spreads information faster than fire.\"\nIn the driver's seat, Chen cursed and turned up the radio.\n\"Breaking news: Multiple witnesses report seeing a dragon off the northern coast last night. Military and scientific teams have been deployed to investigate what experts are calling a mass hallucination or elaborate hoax. We go live to our reporter at the scene...\"\nChen switched it off. \"The whole world is looking for you now.\"\nSophia watched Tharros's reflection in the window. His jaw was tight, scales rippling beneath his skin before fading again. The transformation was becoming harder for him to control.\n\"How much farther to the facility?\" she asked.\n\"Twenty minutes,\" Chen replied, checking his mirrors. \"But we've got company.\"\nTwo black SUVs had appeared behind them, closing fast.\n\"Government,\" Chen said grimly. \"Probably from the Institute.\"\nTharros growled, the sound rumbling through the car. His eyes flashed, pupils narrowing to slits.\n\"Stay calm,\" Sophia said, placing her hand on his. Where their skin touched, their markings glowed faintly. \"Remember why we're here.\"\nThe dragon king took a deep breath, but heat radiated from his skin. \"I don't like being hunted.\"\nChen suddenly swerved onto a dirt road, hidden by trees. The car bounced and rattled as they raced down the narrow path.\n\"Shortcut,\" he explained. \"Should lose them for a while.\"\nSophia's phone buzzed again with a news alert. She opened it and gasped.\n\"They have thermal images,\" she said, showing them the screen. The grainy picture clearly showed Tharros's dragon form gliding above the water. \"They're calling it 'proof of the impossible.'\"\nChen's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. \"This changes everything. The components we need are under military guard now.\"\n\"We can't fail,\" Tharros said, his voice like thunder. \"Aquaria is dying.\"\nSophia remembered the darkness spreading beneath the ocean's surface. The corruption that threatened both worlds.\n\"We won't fail,\" she promised, though uncertainty gnawed at her.\nThe dirt road opened into a clearing where a helicopter waited, its rotors already spinning.\n\"I made some calls,\" Chen said, skidding to a stop. \"This will take you directly to the facility.\"\nAs they climbed out of the car, Sophia noticed Tharros's hands trembling. Scales flickered across his skin like lightning.\n\"He can't hold human form much longer,\" she told Chen. \"The stress is triggering the transformation.\"\nChen nodded grimly. \"Then we'd better hurry.\"\nThe helicopter pilot kept his eyes forward as they boarded, clearly instructed not to look too closely at his passengers. Within minutes, they were airborne, racing along the coastline.\nBelow, Sophia could see more military vehicles converging on the beach where they'd been spotted. Coast Guard boats formed a perimeter in the water.\n\"They're treating this like a national security threat,\" she said.\nTharros stared out the window, his expression dark. \"They should be more worried about what's coming from the deep.\"\nThe helicopter banked sharply, revealing the Oceanic Research Institute in the distance - a gleaming complex of buildings perched on the edge of a cliff.\nSophia's heart raced. This was where it had all started months ago, when they'd first captured Tharros. Now they were returning as allies with a desperate mission.\n\"Look,\" Chen pointed to the Institute's entrance, where news vans and military vehicles crowded the gates. \"They're already there.\"\nThe pilot's voice crackled over their headsets: \"I can't land at the main pad. Too many people. There's a secondary platform on the north side.\"\nAs they approached, Sophia saw figures in suits emerging from the Institute. Director Langley was among them, gesturing angrily at a military officer.\n\"They're demanding answers about you,\" Chen said to Tharros. \"About what you are.\"\nSophia felt Tharros tense beside her. A wave of heat rolled off his skin, making the air shimmer.\n\"Tharros,\" she warned, gripping his arm. \"Not here.\"\nHis golden eyes met hers, wild with the effort of containment. \"It's getting harder,\" he growled through clenched teeth. \"The dragon wants out.\"\nThe helicopter touched down on a small platform extending from the cliff. Chen jumped out first, helping Sophia, while Tharros moved with dangerous grace, his eyes constantly scanning for threats.\n\"This way,\" Chen said, leading them to a service door. \"We can reach the lab without being seen.\"\nThey hurried through dimly lit corridors, the building strangely empty.\n\"Where is everyone?\" Sophia asked.\n\"Emergency protocols,\" Chen explained. \"After the dragon sighting, the facility went into lockdown. Most staff were evacuated.\"\nThey reached a security door where Chen swiped his ID and entered a code. The door slid open to reveal a state-of-the-art laboratory.\n\"This is where we'll build the device,\" he said, activating the systems.\nTharros paced the room like a caged animal, scales now permanently visible along his arms and neck. \"Time is short,\" he growled. \"The darkness spreads.\"\nChen pulled up schematics on a large screen. \"The components we need are in the secure storage vault. Level 5 clearance.\"\n\"Can you get us in?\" Sophia asked.\nChen's expression was grim. \"Not anymore. My access was revoked when they realized I helped you escape. We'll have to find another way.\"\nSuddenly, alarms blared throughout the facility. Red lights flashed, and security doors began to close automatically.\n\"They know we're here,\" Chen said, fingers flying over the keyboard. \"They're tracking our heat signatures.\"\nTharros snarled, his patience finally snapping. His skin glowed with inner fire, the transformation no longer containable.\n\"No!\" Sophia shouted, but it was too late.\nTharros's human form dissolved in a burst of golden light. The dragon filled the laboratory, his massive tail smashing equipment as his wings unfurled against the ceiling.\nThey hunt us like animals, his voice thundered in Sophia's mind. I will not hide anymore.\n\"Tharros, please,\" Sophia begged. \"We need stealth, not strength right now.\"\nBut the dragon king's patience had run out. With a roar that shook the building, he turned toward the wall facing the ocean and unleashed a blast of fire so hot it melted steel and concrete.\nAlarms screamed louder. Through the smoking hole, Sophia could see figures running across the compound, pointing upward.\n\"Too late for stealth,\" Chen said, gathering equipment hastily. \"Plan B.\"\nTharros lowered his massive head to Sophia. Climb on. We take what we need by force.\nSophia hesitated, torn between their mission and the chaos they were causing. Everything was spiraling out of control.\nSophia, Tharros insisted. Our worlds are running out of time.\nShe made her decision, climbing onto his back. \"Chen, can you meet us at the vault?\"\nChen nodded, shoving components into a bag. \"Take the east corridor. I'll create a diversion.\"\nTharros didn't wait for more instructions. He crashed through the laboratory wall, emerging into a wide corridor. Screams echoed as staff fled in terror.\nThrough the bond, Sophia felt Tharros's savage joy at no longer hiding. The dragon had been contained too long.\nThey rampaged through the facility, following Sophia's directions toward the secure storage. Alarms wailed and sprinklers rained water that turned to steam against Tharros's hot scales.\nWhen they reached the vault, two armed guards stood their ground, weapons raised.\n\"Dr. Rodriguez!\" one shouted in shock. \"What are you doing?\"\n\"Saving the world,\" she answered as Tharros growled.\nBefore the guards could fire, Chen appeared behind them, detonating a smoke bomb. In the confusion, Tharros swept his tail, knocking them unconscious without killing them.\nChen worked quickly, hacking the security panel. The vault door slid open, revealing racks of advanced technology.\n\"We need the quantum stabilizer and the energy converter,\" Sophia said, pointing.\nAs Chen gathered the components, a voice rang out from speakers overhead.\n\"Attention all personnel. This is Director Langley. The facility is surrounded. To the intruders: surrender immediately.\"\nTharros answered with a roar that shattered windows.\n\"We have what we need,\" Chen said, securing the last component. \"But there's no way out except...\" He glanced toward the ocean cliffs.\nSophia understood immediately. \"Back to the sea.\"\nThey raced through the corridors, Tharros smashing through walls when necessary. Finally, they reached the observation deck overlooking the ocean, three hundred feet below.\nMilitary helicopters appeared on the horizon. Spotlights swept the building.\n\"Go!\" Chen urged, handing the bag of components to Sophia. \"I'll create cover.\"\n\"Come with us,\" Sophia pleaded.\nChen shook his head. \"Someone has to stay behind to tell your story. The world needs to know what's really happening.\"\nTharros lowered his head in respect. Your bravery will be remembered in Aquaria, human.\nSophia hugged Chen fiercely. \"Thank you for everything.\"\nWith tears in her eyes, she climbed onto Tharros's back, securing the precious components.\n\"Now!\" Chen shouted, triggering explosions at the far end of the facility.\nTharros spread his massive wings and leaped from the cliff. They plummeted toward the dark ocean below, wind screaming past Sophia's ears.\nJust before they hit the water, news helicopters appeared above them, cameras capturing every detail of the dragon's dive.\nAs they disappeared beneath the waves, Sophia knew their secret was truly gone. The divide between worlds had collapsed completely.\nAnd somewhere in the depths, the darkness waited.\nFriends in Hidden Places",

The components they'd stolen from the Institute were wrapped tightly in her arms, precious cargo that could save two worlds.\n\"We need to surface,\" Sophia said through their mental link. \"We can't take these parts to Aquaria yet.\"\nTharros's massive dragon form slowed. The military searches everywhere. Where can we go?\n\"I know a place,\" Sophia replied. \"Head north along the coast. There's a hidden cove.\"\nThe dragon changed direction, swimming deeper to avoid detection. Above, they could see the shadows of boats crossing the water's surface, searchlights stabbing down into the depths.\nWhen they reached the cove, Sophia was surprised to see a small submarine waiting. As they approached, a hatch opened, revealing Dr. Chen's smiling face.\n\"How?\" Sophia gasped as they surfaced.\n\"I have my ways,\" Chen winked. \"Hurry! Get inside before they spot you.\"\nTharros growled, his enormous form too large for the submarine.\n\"You'll need to transform,\" Sophia said gently, touching his scales.\nThe dragon king huffed, sending steam rising from the water's surface. With obvious reluctance, his body began to glow and shrink. Soon, a man stood in the water beside her, golden eyes flashing with annoyance.\n\"I hate being confined,\" he muttered as Chen helped them aboard.\nThe submarine's hatch sealed with a hiss. Chen worked quickly at the controls, and the vessel submerged.\n\"I thought you stayed behind,\" Sophia said, shivering in her wet clothes.\nChen handed them towels. \"I did, for about five minutes. Just long enough to delete the security footage and leave a false trail. They think you're heading south.\"\n\"Where are we going?\" Tharros demanded, looking uncomfortable in the tight space.\n\"Somewhere they'll never look,\" Chen replied, guiding the submarine into an underwater tunnel. \"The Institute's secret lab.\"\nThe tunnel opened into a massive underwater cave. Lights flicked on automatically as they approached a submerged dock. The submarine surfaced, and Chen secured it to the platform.\n\"Welcome to Project Poseidon,\" he said, opening the hatch. \"The Institute's most classified facility.\"\nThey climbed out to find themselves in an enormous cavern. Advanced laboratory equipment filled the space, with tanks of seawater and strange machines Sophia had never seen before.\n\"How long has this been here?\" she asked in wonder.\n\"Twenty years,\" Chen replied. \"Director Langley doesn't even know about it. Only a few of us do.\"\nA door opened at the far end of the cavern, and three people in lab coats hurried toward them. Sophia felt her heart leap - she recognized them instantly.\n\"Maya! Jackson! Dr. Rivera!\" she cried.\nHer former colleagues stopped short, staring at her with wide eyes.\n\"Sophia?\" Maya whispered. \"Is that really you?\"\nSophia suddenly remembered how she must look. In the weeks since she'd left with Tharros, her transformation had continued. Her skin now had a faint shimmery quality, and her eyes had changed to an iridescent blue-green.\n\"It's me,\" she confirmed, stepping forward.\nMaya rushed to embrace her, while Jackson and Dr. Rivera approached more cautiously, their eyes fixed on Tharros.\n\"So it's true,\" Dr. Rivera said quietly. \"Dragons exist.\"\nTharros lifted his chin, golden eyes narrowing. \"We have existed long before humans crawled from the mud,\" he said coldly.\nSophia shot him a warning look. \"These are friends,\" she said. \"They can help us.\"\nChen quickly explained the situation - the corruption spreading beneath the ocean, the threat to both worlds, the components they needed to build a device to stop it.\n\"Show us what you've got,\" Jackson said, examining the stolen technology.\nAs her colleagues gathered around the components, Sophia pulled Tharros aside.\n\"Please try to be patient with them,\" she whispered. \"They're scientists. They're curious.\"\n\"They look at me like I'm a specimen,\" he growled. \"I am a king.\"\n\"And they know that,\" Sophia assured him. \"But we need their help.\"\nReluctantly, Tharros nodded. His skin was still rippling with barely contained scales, the effort of maintaining human form clearly taxing him.\n\"We've been tracking the anomalies under the ocean for months,\" Maya told them, pulling up charts on a large screen. Dark patches spread across the map of the seafloor. \"Whatever this corruption is, it's growing faster than we predicted.\"\n\"It feeds on magic,\" Tharros explained. \"The more it consumes, the stronger it becomes.\"\nDr. Rivera's eyes widened. \"Magic? You're speaking of energy we can't detect?\"\n\"Can't detect YET,\" Jackson corrected, already tinkering with one of the stolen components. \"That's why we need this quantum stabilizer. It can translate magical energy into something measurable.\"\nFor hours, they worked together. Sophia moved between them, translating Tharros's ancient knowledge of magic into scientific terms her colleagues could understand. For his part, Tharros watched with growing impatience, occasionally offering grudging explanations when asked.\n\"Your dragon friend doesn't like us much,\" Maya whispered to Sophia while they calibrated sensors.\n\"He's worried,\" Sophia explained. \"His kingdom is dying. And he's not used to asking humans for help.\"\n\"And what about you?\" Maya asked, looking closely at Sophia's changed features. \"Are you still... human?\"\nSophia paused, the question catching her off guard. \"I'm... me,\" she finally answered. \"Just with a few upgrades.\"\nBy midnight, exhaustion was setting in. The device was taking shape - a spherical contraption with the quantum stabilizer at its core, surrounded by the energy converter and various other components.\nTharros paced the laboratory, his tension making the air around him shimmer with heat. \"We must hurry,\" he insisted. \"The corruption will reach the barrier between our worlds soon.\"\n\"Science takes time,\" Dr. Rivera snapped, his patience wearing thin.\n\"Time is what we don't have!\" Tharros roared, his voice suddenly inhuman. Golden scales erupted across his skin, and his eyes blazed like fire.\nEveryone froze. Jackson dropped a tool with a clatter.\n\"Tharros,\" Sophia said softly, stepping toward him. \"They're doing their best.\"\nThe dragon king took a deep breath, the scales slowly receding. \"Forgive me,\" he said stiffly. \"My concern is for Aquaria.\"\n\"And our concern is for Earth,\" Chen said firmly. \"We're all on the same side here.\"\nAn uneasy peace settled as they returned to work. Sophia felt the weight of both worlds on her shoulders - torn between her scientific colleagues and the underwater kingdom that had become her second home.\nNear dawn, a breakthrough came. Jackson connected the final circuit, and the device hummed to life. Blue energy pulsed within the sphere, growing brighter with each second.\n\"It works!\" Maya exclaimed. \"The quantum stabilizer is converting energy!\"\nDr. Rivera checked the readings. \"But it's still not powerful enough to seal the corruption. We need a stronger energy source.\"\n\"Magic,\" Tharros said, stepping forward. \"It needs dragon fire.\"\nBefore anyone could stop him, Tharros placed his hands on the sphere. His skin glowed golden, and energy poured from his palms into the device. The blue light turned purple, then a brilliant white that forced everyone to shield their eyes.\nWhen the light faded, the sphere pulsed with steady rainbow energy. But Tharros staggered backward, his face pale.\n\"Tharros!\" Sophia caught him before he fell. \"What did you do?\"\n\"Gave it part of my essence,\" he said weakly. \"A dragon's heartfire.\"\n\"Is it enough?\" Chen asked Dr. Rivera.\nThe older scientist checked the readings, his face grave. \"Almost. It needs one more thing - a conductor that can bridge both worlds.\" He looked at Sophia. \"Someone who belongs to both.\"\nAll eyes turned to her. Sophia felt a chill run down her spine.\n\"Me?\" she whispered.\nTharros struggled to stand. \"No. It's too dangerous. There must be another way.\"\n\"There isn't,\" Dr. Rivera said. \"The device needs a living connector - someone with both human DNA and magical essence. Someone like Sophia.\"\n\"What would I have to do?\" Sophia asked, her voice steadier than she felt.\n\"Place your hands where Tharros did,\" Dr. Rivera explained. \"The device will draw a small amount of your energy to complete the circuit. But...\" he hesitated.\n\"But what?\" Tharros demanded.\n\"But whoever connects the device must also deliver it to the source of the corruption,\" Maya finished. \"They become linked to it.\"\nSilence fell over the laboratory. Sophia looked at the pulsing sphere, then at Tharros, whose golden eyes were wide with fear - not for himself, but for her.\n\"I'll do it,\" she said firmly.",

        "content": "\"Sophia, no,\" Tharros protested. \"The depths where the corruption originates are too dangerous, even for me.\"\n\"I don't see another choice,\" she replied. \"I'm the bridge between worlds. I always have been.\"\nBefore Tharros could argue further, alarms blared throughout the facility. Red lights flashed, and security screens showed military vessels approaching above.\n\"They've found us,\" Chen said, rushing to the controls. \"We need to leave now!\"\nSophia made her decision. She stepped forward and placed her hands on the sphere. Instantly, pain shot through her body - not physical pain, but something deeper, as if the device were binding itself to her soul.\nThe sphere's light changed again, shifting to a rich blue-green that matched her eyes. When she removed her hands, glowing markings identical to those on the sphere had appeared on her palms.\n\"It's done,\" she whispered, feeling the device's power humming within her.\nTharros stared at her with a mixture of awe and despair. \"What have you done?\"\n\"Saved us both time,\" she said, trying to smile despite her fear. \"Now let's go before the military breaks down the door.\"\nJackson quickly packed the sphere into a special case. \"This will protect it until you reach the corruption's source.\"\nMaya hugged Sophia tightly. \"Come back to us,\" she whispered.\n\"We'll create a diversion,\" Chen promised, already heading for the controls. \"Give you time to escape.\"\nSophia turned to Tharros, who still looked shaken. \"Ready to go home?\" she asked.\nHis expression hardened with resolve. \"Our home,\" he corrected, taking her hand.\nAs they boarded the submarine, Sophia looked back at her friends - scientists who now stood between two worlds, just as she did. The weight of the device pulsed in time with her heartbeat, a constant reminder of what was at stake.\nThe submarine slipped into the underwater tunnel just as the first explosions rocked the facility above. Their journey back to Aquaria had begun - carrying with them humanity's technology, dragon magic, and the last hope for both worlds.\nBut as they descended into the deep, darkness swirled beneath them, as if waiting.\n Two Worlds Colliding\nSophia gasped for air as the submarine broke the surface. The glowing marks on her palms pulsed in rhythm with her racing heart. Beside her, Tharros looked up at the stars, his golden eyes reflecting the moonlight.\n\"We can't go to Aquaria yet,\" he said, his voice tight with worry. \"The military is still searching for us.\"\nSophia clutched the device to her chest. The sphere hummed with energy, sending tingles up her arms. \"We need to test it first anyway. Chen, where should we go?\"\nDr. Chen pointed to a rocky shoreline. \"There. That cove is hidden from radar.\"\nAs they beached the small submarine, Sophia's mind raced with thoughts of Kael and Arin. It had been days since she'd been able to connect with them through the mental link they shared. Something was blocking their connection, and that worried her more than any military search.\n\"I need to know what's happening in Aquaria,\" she told Tharros as they unloaded the equipment onto the beach.\nHis face darkened. \"I feel it too. The corruption is spreading faster.\"\n\"Can you try to reach them?\" Sophia asked, touching his arm. His skin was burning hot, a sign of his rising anxiety.\nTharros closed his eyes. The air around him shimmered as he extended his consciousness toward the ocean depths. After a moment, his eyes snapped open, glowing with alarm.\n\"Kael and Arin are in trouble,\" he growled. \"The barrier between our worlds is failing. The corruption has reached the outer city.\"\nDeep beneath the waves, Kael swung his trident at the writhing blackness. The corruption had taken physical form now - tentacles of oily darkness that grabbed at anything with magical energy.\n\"Behind you!\" Arin shouted, sending a blast of blue fire to burn away a tendril reaching for Kael's neck.\nThe warrior spun, driving his weapon into the darkness. It shrieked - a sound that shouldn't be possible underwater - and retreated momentarily.\n\"We can't keep this up,\" Kael panted, swimming to Arin's side. His armor was cracked in several places, leaking trails of blood into the water.\nArin's normally perfect white hair floated around her face in tangled strands. Her eyes glowed with fading power. \"Where are Sophia and Tharros? They should have returned by now.\"\nA wave of corruption surged toward them, blotting out the bioluminescent lights of the underwater city. Citizens fled toward the palace, the last stronghold still protected by ancient magic.\n\"Fall back!\" Kael ordered his warriors. \"Protect the inner city!\"\nAs they retreated, Arin tried once more to reach the surface with her mind. Sophia, Tharros, we need you. Aquaria is falling.\nOn the beach, Sophia jerked as if struck. \"They're calling us,\" she whispered. \"We need to hurry.\"\nDr. Chen worked quickly, connecting the sphere to monitoring equipment. \"We need to test it first. If this fails, both worlds are doomed.\"\nTharros paced impatiently, steam rising from his shoulders as his control slipped. \"There's no time for tests!\"\n\"Five minutes,\" Sophia said firmly. \"That's all we need.\" She placed her hands on the sphere, wincing as it drew energy from her. The markings on her palms glowed brighter, matching the pulse of light inside the device.\nChen watched the readings on his tablet. \"Power levels are stable. Now we need to see if it can actually neutralize the corruption.\"\nSophia looked around. \"But we don't have any corruption here to test it on.\"\nTharros stepped forward. \"We don't need to find corruption.\" He placed his hands over Sophia's on the sphere. \"We need to open a small portal to where the corruption is.\"\n\"Is that safe?\" Chen asked, alarmed.\n\"No,\" Tharros admitted. \"But we have no choice.\"\nTharros began to chant in an ancient language. The sphere's light changed from blue-green to golden as his dragon magic flowed into it. Sophia felt the device growing hotter, the energy building to impossible levels.\n\"Something's happening!\" Chen shouted, backing away as the air around them began to distort.\nThe beach in front of them shimmered like a mirage. Then, with a sound like tearing fabric, reality split open. Through the rift, they could see dark water swirling - not the ocean as they knew it, but the magical waters of Aquaria.\nAnd in those waters, they saw the battle.\nKael spun in the water, suddenly aware of a strange light behind him. When he turned, his eyes widened in shock.\nA tear had appeared in the water itself - a window looking onto a beach under moonlight. And through it, he could see Sophia, Tharros, and a human he didn't recognize.\n\"Arin!\" he called. \"Look!\"\nThe sea witch swam to his side, her exhaustion momentarily forgotten. \"They've opened a portal!\"\nThrough the wavering connection, their eyes met across two worlds. For a moment, no one moved.\nThen darkness surged toward the portal from Aquaria's side - tentacles of corruption sensing the magic and rushing to consume it.\n\"The device!\" Sophia screamed as the corruption reached toward their reality. \"Activate it now!\"\nTharros pressed their hands harder against the sphere. \"Focus your energy, Sophia. You're the bridge!\"\nSophia closed her eyes, channeling everything she had into the device. She thought of Aquaria, of Earth, of the four of them bound together by fate and choice. She thought of Maya, Jackson, and Dr. Rivera working to save a world they'd only just discovered existed.\nThe sphere erupted with blinding light.\nThe corruption recoiled as the light hit it. Where the energy touched the darkness, it sizzled and dissolved.\n\"It's working!\" Arin cried, her voice hoarse with hope.\nKael watched in awe as the light spread in a perfect circle from the portal, pushing back the corruption wherever it touched. Warriors behind him cheered.\nBut then something unexpected happened. As the light cleared the corruption, the portal began to grow larger.\n\"What's happening?\" Kael shouted to Arin.\nThe sea witch's eyes were wide. \"The barriers are falling!\"\nOn the beach, Chen staggered backward as the portal expanded. \"This wasn't supposed to happen! The device was meant to seal the worlds, not open them!\"\nSophia couldn't let go of the sphere. Energy poured through her, using her as a conduit between worlds. She was vaguely aware of Tharros shouting, of Chen frantically typing on his tablet.\nThe portal grew until it was taller than a person, wider than their submarine. Through it, they could see the glowing spires of Aquaria in the distance, and closer, the shocked faces of Aquarian citizens staring back at them.\nFor the first time in history, humans were looking directly into the magical underwater kingdom.\nAnd the Aquarians were looking back.\n\"Stop the device!\" Tharros roared, trying to pull Sophia's hands away. But they seemed fused to the sphere, her eyes glowing with the same light as the portal.\n\"I can't!\" she cried. \"It's drawing too much power!\"\nChen's equipment sparked and died as the energy overwhelmed it. \"The magnetic readings are off the charts! This could tear a permanent hole between worlds!\"\nThrough the portal, they could see Kael and Arin swimming toward them. Behind them, more curious Aquarians approached cautiously, their faces showing wonder and fear.\n\"Sophia!\" Kael called, his voice distorted through the barrier. \"The corruption is retreating, but something else is coming!\"\n\"What?\" Sophia shouted back. \"What's coming?\"\nBefore he could answer, the ground beneath them shook. The sea churned as something massive moved beneath the surface, drawn to the unprecedented magical energy.\nTharros's face went pale. \"No,\" he whispered. \"It can't be.\"",

        "content": "\"What?\" Sophia demanded. \"What is it?\"\nThe dragon king looked at her with dread in his golden eyes. \"The Leviathan. The one from the prophecy. We've awakened it.\"\nAs if in response, a monstrous shadow appeared in the depths beyond the portal. Larger than any creature should be, ancient beyond reckoning, it moved toward the light with terrible purpose.\nSophia looked from the approaching horror to the glowing device in her hands, to the faces of humans gathering on the beach behind them - scientists and military personnel drawn by the unnatural light.\nTwo worlds stared at each other across an impossible divide.\nAnd in the darkness between them, something ancient and hungry was waking up.\n  Unwanted Attention\nThe blinding light from the portal cut off suddenly as Sophia yanked her hands from the sphere. She fell backward onto the sand, gasping for breath. The glowing marks on her palms slowly faded to a dull shimmer.\n\"Close it!\" she screamed at Tharros. \"Close the portal!\"\nThe dragon king placed both hands on the device, his golden eyes blazing with effort. The tear between worlds shrank inch by inch, but not before several military personnel had seen directly into Aquaria.\n\"What was that?\" a soldier shouted, pointing his flashlight at them.\nDr. Chen stepped forward, blocking their view of Sophia and the device. \"Institute research,\" he said firmly, flashing his ID. \"Classified.\"\nMore flashlights swept the beach as vehicles rumbled to a stop on the road above. Sophia's heart pounded as she wrapped the sphere in the special case Jackson had prepared. The device was still hot to the touch, pulsing with energy.\n\"We need to get out of here,\" Tharros whispered, helping her to her feet. His human disguise was slipping - scales glittered across his neck, and his eyes were fully reptilian.\n\"Too late,\" Chen muttered as a helicopter appeared overhead, its searchlight pinning them in bright white light.\nAdmiral Pierce stepped out of the black SUV, his weathered face hard as stone. Twenty years in Naval Intelligence hadn't prepared him for what his team had just reported - a portal to an underwater city filled with creatures from myth.\n\"Secure the area,\" he ordered. \"No one in or out. And find me someone who can explain what the hell I just saw.\"\nAs his men moved into position, surrounding the beach and the small group huddled there, Pierce studied the woman at the center. Dr. Sophia Rodriguez - the missing marine biologist whose disappearance had triggered this whole operation. She looked different now. Something about her eyes, her skin...\n\"Sir,\" his aide reported, \"the energy signature matches what we detected at the Institute before Dr. Rodriguez disappeared. Same frequency, but a thousand times stronger.\"\nPierce nodded. \"Bring them in. All of them.\"\nSophia felt the military closing in around them like a net. Tharros stood at her side, his body tense and ready to fight.\n\"Don't,\" she whispered, grabbing his wrist. \"If you transform here, they'll never stop hunting our kind.\"\nA tall man in a naval uniform approached, flanked by armed soldiers. \"Dr. Rodriguez,\" he said, his voice carrying authority. \"I'm Admiral Pierce. You're coming with us.\"\nChen stepped between them. \"Actually, Admiral, you're interrupting a sanctioned experiment.\" He pulled out a tablet and tapped it a few times before turning it around. \"Authorization code Omega-7. Signed by Director Langley herself.\"\nPierce frowned at the document. \"I wasn't informed-\"\n\"It's classified beyond your clearance level,\" Chen said smoothly. \"But feel free to call the Director and explain why you're interfering with our work.\"\nSophia held her breath. Chen was bluffing - the document had to be fake. But it looked official enough to make Pierce hesitate.\n\"What exactly are you testing here, Dr. Chen?\" Pierce asked, his eyes narrowing.\n\"New sonar technology,\" Chen replied without missing a beat. \"The light effect was an unexpected side effect. Quite impressive, wasn't it?\"\n\"That wasn't sonar,\" Pierce said flatly. \"My men saw... something else.\"\n\"What did they see, exactly?\" Chen challenged. \"Strange lights on the water? Reflections? Hallucinations after staring too long at experimental equipment? I'd be interested to read those reports, Admiral.\"\nSophia clutched the device tighter, feeling its energy hum against her chest. It was calling to something inside her - the part of her that belonged to Aquaria.\nBeneath the waves, Kael and Arin watched the portal shrink until it disappeared completely. The brief connection to the surface world had driven back the corruption, but for how long?\n\"We need to prepare,\" Kael said, turning to his warriors. \"When the portal reopens, we must be ready to defend it.\"\nArin drifted closer, her pale face troubled. \"Did you feel it? When the portal was open?\"\n\"The Leviathan,\" Kael nodded grimly. \"It's awake, just as the prophecy foretold.\"\nAround them, citizens of Aquaria whispered among themselves. For the first time, they had seen the world above - strange beings standing on dry land, breathing air, their bodies unadorned by scales or fins.\n\"The people are afraid,\" Arin said quietly. \"They've never seen humans before.\"\n\"And the humans have never seen us,\" Kael replied. \"This changes everything.\"\nOn the beach, the standoff continued. More military vehicles had arrived, and Sophia counted at least thirty soldiers surrounding them now.\n\"I need to speak with Director Langley,\" Admiral Pierce finally said, stepping away to make the call.\nChen turned to Sophia and Tharros, keeping his voice low. \"When I give the signal, run for the submarine. I've disabled their communications temporarily, but it won't last long.\"\nSophia shook her head. \"We can't just leave you here.\"\n\"You have to,\" Chen insisted. \"That device is the only hope for both worlds. I'll find you later.\"\nPierce returned, his expression unreadable. \"Your authorization checks out, Dr. Chen. For now.\" He gestured to his men. \"But I'm leaving a team to observe. Whatever you're doing here, it's caught Washington's attention.\"\nChen nodded, accepting the compromise. \"We'll be continuing our work at the Institute. Feel free to send your observers there.\"\nAs the military began to withdraw slightly, Chen gave Sophia a meaningful look. She understood - this was their chance.\n\"Now,\" he whispered.\nSophia grabbed Tharros's hand and ran for the submarine, keeping the device clutched tightly against her. Behind them, Chen created a diversion, \"accidentally\" activating some equipment that sent sparks flying into the air.\nThey made it to the submarine just as the soldiers realized what was happening. Bullets pinged against the metal hull as Tharros slammed the hatch shut.\n\"Hold on,\" he growled, taking the controls.\nThe submarine slipped beneath the waves just as searchlights swept over the water. Sophia watched through the periscope as the surface world disappeared above them.\n\"Head for the deep channel,\" she told Tharros. \"We need to get to Aquaria before they can track us.\"\nAdmiral Pierce watched the water where the submarine had disappeared. He'd let them escape - for now. Something told him they'd return to the Institute eventually, and his men would be waiting.\n\"Sir,\" his aide approached with a phone. \"There's someone on the line for you. Says it's about Dr. Rodriguez and the experiment.\"\nPierce took the phone. \"This is Admiral Pierce.\"\n\"Admiral,\" a smooth voice replied. \"My name is Elias Blackwood, CEO of Oceanic Horizons. I believe we have a mutual interest in what happened tonight.\"\nPierce frowned. Oceanic Horizons was a private research corporation, known for pushing boundaries in marine technology. \"I'm listening.\"\n\"My company has been tracking unusual energy signatures for months,\" Blackwood continued. \"What you witnessed tonight is only the beginning. I'd like to offer my resources to help you understand what you're dealing with.\"\n\"And what do you want in return, Mr. Blackwood?\"\nThe man chuckled. \"Information, Admiral. Just information.\"\nDr. Chen waited until the military presence had thinned before heading back to his car. The deception had worked, but it wouldn't hold for long. Once Pierce checked with the real Director Langley, they'd be hunting them all.\nAs he reached his vehicle, Chen noticed a black luxury car parked nearby. A woman in an expensive suit leaned against it, watching him.\n\"Dr. Chen,\" she called. \"A moment of your time?\"\nChen paused, instantly wary. \"Do I know you?\"\nThe woman smiled. \"Not yet. My name is Victoria Shaw, representing Oceanic Horizons. My employer is very interested in your work.\"\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Chen replied, reaching for his car door.\n\"The device that created the portal,\" Victoria said calmly. \"The one Dr. Rodriguez took to Aquaria.\"\nChen froze. No one should know about Aquaria - no one from the surface world except their small team.\n\"We've been watching for years, Dr. Chen,\" Victoria continued. \"The underwater kingdom, the dragon king, the prophecy... we know everything.\"\n\"What do you want?\" Chen asked, his mouth suddenly dry.\nVictoria handed him a business card. \"Help. Protection from the military. Resources to continue your work.\" Her smile widened. \"All we ask for in return is information about what lies beneath the waves.\"\nChen took the card slowly, feeling a chill that had nothing to do with the night air.\n\"Think about it,\" Victoria said, walking back to her car. \"We'll be in touch.\"\nAs she drove away, Chen looked down at the card in his hand. Embossed in gold was a simple logo - a trident piercing a wave.\nThe same symbol that had been carved into the ancient ruins beneath Aquaria's palace.\n Corporate Interest\nThree days after their narrow escape, Sophia paced the small underwater cave they'd found as a hiding place. The sphere device sat on a flat rock, its light pulsing weakly.\n\"It's losing power,\" she said, running her fingers over the strange markings that matched her palms. \"We need to recharge it before we can use it against the Leviathan.\"\nTharros sat cross-legged on the cave floor, his golden eyes tracking her movements. In the dim light, his skin occasionally flickered with scales.\n\"We can't return to the surface,\" he said. \"The military will be watching everywhere.\"\n\"And we can't go to Aquaria yet,\" Sophia added. \"Not until the device is ready.\" She slammed her fist against the cave wall in frustration. \"We're stuck!\"\nThe water at the cave entrance rippled, and both tensed until Dr. Chen's head emerged from below. He pulled himself onto the rocky ledge, dripping and breathing hard.\n\"You're alive!\" Sophia rushed to help him. \"We were worried.\"\nChen coughed water from his lungs. \"Barely made it. The military has the entire coastline locked down. They're calling it a national security threat.\"\n\"Did they follow you?\" Tharros demanded.\n\"No,\" Chen assured them. \"But someone else did.\" He reached into his waterproof bag and pulled out a tablet. \"The people from Oceanic Horizons. They found me last night.\"\nSophia took the tablet, surprised to see it was still working despite being underwater. \"What's this?\"\n\"Plans,\" Chen said. \"For upgrading your device. They knew exactly what we were building.\"\nTharros growled, the sound echoing in the small cave. \"Impossible. No surface dweller should know about Aquarian technology.\"\nChen's face was grim. \"They know about everything, Tharros. The corruption. The Leviathan. Even your transformation ability.\"\nSophia scrolled through the tablet's contents, her scientific mind racing. \"These modifications... they're exactly what we need. How could they know?\"\n\"They want to meet,\" Chen said. \"Their representative is waiting above. Someone named Victoria Shaw.\"\nSophia broke the surface cautiously, scanning the coastline for military boats. The small inlet seemed deserted except for an elegant yacht anchored offshore. A woman in a white business suit stood on the deck, watching them through binoculars.\n\"That's her,\" Chen whispered as they swam closer.\nWhen they reached the yacht, Victoria Shaw greeted them with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. \"Dr. Rodriguez. King Tharros. I'm delighted you accepted my invitation.\"\nTharros climbed aboard with inhuman grace, water streaming from his human form. His nostrils flared as he studied Victoria. \"You smell of old magic.\"\nHer smile faltered for just a moment. \"Please, come inside. We have much to discuss.\"\nThe yacht's cabin was a floating laboratory. High-tech equipment lined the walls, and in the center sat components identical to those they had stolen from the Institute.\n\"How do you have these?\" Sophia asked, touching a quantum stabilizer that looked even more advanced than the one they'd used.\n\"Oceanic Horizons has been studying the barrier between worlds for decades,\" Victoria explained, pouring tea as if they were having a casual social visit. \"We've known about Aquaria since the company was founded in 1893.\"\nTharros's eyes narrowed. \"Impossible. The barriers have stood for ten thousand years.\"\n\"Have they?\" Victoria raised an eyebrow. \"Or have there always been... leaks?\" She pressed a button, and a holographic display appeared above the table. It showed ancient cave paintings, medieval manuscripts, and modern sonar readings - all depicting the same underwater structures. Aquaria.\n\"My great-grandfather was a fisherman who followed strange lights into a storm,\" Victoria continued. \"His boat sank, but he didn't drown. He was saved by beings with scales and golden eyes.\" She looked directly at Tharros. \"Beings like you.\"\nSophia exchanged glances with Tharros. His face remained suspicious, but she could see uncertainty in his eyes.\n\"When he returned, he founded our company with one purpose - to reconnect with the underwater world that saved him.\" Victoria gestured to the equipment around them. \"Everything we've developed has been leading to this moment.\"\n\"Why reveal yourselves now?\" Chen asked.\n\"Because the corruption is spreading to the surface world,\" Victoria said. \"Strange phenomena are being reported along coastlines globally. Dead zones where all electronic equipment fails. Sea creatures washing ashore with mysterious black markings.\" She handed Sophia another tablet. \"These are from yesterday.\"\nThe images showed familiar patterns of corruption - the same that had been spreading through Aquaria.\n\"Help us,\" Victoria said, her composure cracking slightly to reveal genuine fear. \"The military wants to destroy what they don't understand. We want to save both worlds.\"\nIn Aquaria, Kael winced as Arin pressed healing coral against the wound on his shoulder. The latest attack by the corruption had left half his warriors injured.\n\"It's getting worse,\" Arin said, her pale fingers trembling slightly. \"The protective spells around the palace won't hold much longer.\"\nKael looked out the palace window at the city below. Once-bright bioluminescent streets now flickered with dying light. Citizens huddled in the central squares, too afraid to return to their homes in the outer rings where darkness was spreading.\n\"Any word from Sophia?\" he asked.\nArin shook her head. \"The mental link is still blocked. Something is interfering.\"\nA young mer-guard burst into the chamber, his face tight with panic. \"Commander! The eastern barrier has fallen. The corruption is entering the inner city!\"\nKael grabbed his trident, ignoring the pain from his wound. \"Evacuate everyone to the palace. We make our stand here.\"\nAs Arin gathered her potions and spellbooks, she paused, her head tilting as if listening to something only she could hear.\n\"What is it?\" Kael asked.\n\"Magic,\" she whispered. \"Old magic... awakening on the surface.\"\nBack on the yacht, Victoria had opened a hidden compartment in the floor. Inside was a crystal unlike anything Sophia had seen before - pulsing with blue-green light identical to the markings on her palms.\n\"This was recovered from the seafloor near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,\" Victoria explained. \"We believe it's a piece of Aquaria's original barrier spell.\"\nTharros stared at the crystal, his composure slipping enough that scales rippled across his cheeks. \"The Heartstone,\" he whispered. \"It was lost thousands of years ago.\"\n\"What does it do?\" Sophia asked, feeling drawn to the crystal.\n\"It amplifies magic,\" Tharros explained, his voice reverent. \"It was used by the first king to create Aquaria.\"\nVictoria nodded. \"And we believe it can supercharge your device - make it powerful enough to seal the corruption permanently.\"\n\"Why would you give us something so valuable?\" Chen asked suspiciously.\n\"In exchange for access,\" Victoria said simply. \"When this is over, we want diplomatic relations with Aquaria. A formal alliance between our company and your kingdom.\" She looked at Tharros. \"We've waited over a century for this opportunity.\"\nSophia could see the conflict in Tharros's eyes - desperation to save his kingdom warring with millennia of isolation and distrust of humans.\n\"We need to discuss this privately,\" Sophia said.",

        "content": "Victoria nodded. \"Of course. Take all the time you need.\" She paused at the door. \"But not too long. The military discovered your energy signature. They'll be here within hours.\"\nOnce alone, Tharros paced the cabin like a caged animal. \"We cannot trust her,\" he hissed. \"No human should possess the Heartstone.\"\n\"But she does,\" Sophia pointed out. \"And we need it.\"\nChen examined the crystal from a distance. \"Their technology is far beyond what we had at the Institute. With this, we might actually succeed.\"\n\"It feels like a trap,\" Tharros growled. \"There's something she's not telling us.\"\nSophia placed her hand on the sphere device, then looked at the Heartstone. The two seemed to pulse in perfect harmony. \"We're running out of options, Tharros. Kael and Arin are fighting for their lives in Aquaria. The corruption is spreading to the surface. We need this.\"\n\"At what cost?\" Tharros demanded. \"Once humans have a path to Aquaria, they will never leave us in peace.\"\nSophia took his hands in hers, feeling the heat of his skin. \"Some humans destroyed. Some humans saved. Just like some Aquarians are good and some aren't.\" She squeezed his fingers. \"We have to try.\"\nAfter a long moment, Tharros nodded reluctantly. \"But I will be watching her. If she betrays us-\"\n\"You can eat her,\" Sophia finished with a grim smile. \"I won't stop you.\"\nWhen Victoria returned, Sophia stepped forward. \"We accept your help. But this isn't an agreement for future access. That will be decided by all four rulers of Aquaria, not just us.\"\nVictoria's smile tightened, but she nodded. \"Fair enough. Shall we begin the modifications?\"\nAs Victoria's team brought equipment aboard, Tharros moved close to Sophia. \"There's something familiar about her,\" he whispered. \"Something in her blood that calls to old magic.\"\n\"What does that mean?\" Sophia asked.\nBefore Tharros could answer, a technician activated the Heartstone. It blazed with sudden light, and Sophia gasped as the markings on her palms responded, glowing brilliantly.\nVictoria watched with fascination. \"The stone recognizes you,\" she said softly. Then she rolled up her sleeve, revealing a birthmark on her forearm - in the exact shape of Aquaria's royal crest.\n\"Just as it recognizes me,\" Victoria added, her eyes meeting Tharros's widened gaze. \"We have more in common than you think, Dragon King. Much more.\"\n  Divided Forces\nKael's hands trembled as he unrolled the ancient scroll. The palace library had flooded three hours ago, forcing him and a small team of scholars to salvage what they could from the deepest archives.\n\"Commander, you should see this,\" called one of the younger mer-scholars, her blue tail flicking nervously as she pointed to symbols etched into a stone tablet.\nKael swam closer, eyes widening as he recognized the markings. They matched the birthmark Victoria Shaw had revealed on the surface.\n\"The Boundary Pact,\" he whispered, running his webbed fingers over the stone. \"It's not a myth.\"\nThe tablet showed seven human figures and seven mer-people, hands joined around a central crystal-the Heartstone. At the bottom, carved in the oldest language of the sea, were words that chilled Kael's blood: Seven bloodlines shall remember. Seven bloodlines shall protect. When darkness rises, the divided shall reunite.\n\"Some humans have always known about us,\" Kael said, feeling the weight of centuries press down on him. \"They've been waiting.\"\nA violent tremor shook the palace, sending shimmering bubbles cascading from the ceiling.\n\"The eastern sector just collapsed,\" reported a guard, rushing into the chamber. \"The corruption is spreading faster.\"\nKael gathered the tablet and scrolls, securing them in a waterproof satchel. \"Get these to the central chamber. I need to find Arin.\"\nHe found the sea witch in her workshop, surrounded by swirling magical currents. Her normally pale skin glowed with an eerie blue light as she channeled her power into a large sphere of water floating before her.\n\"I can see them,\" she said without turning. \"The breaches. There are seven-no, eight now. The barriers are failing everywhere.\"\nKael approached carefully, feeling the crackle of magic against his scales. \"Show me.\"\nThe sphere rippled, revealing a map of Aquaria. Red spots pulsed at eight different locations around the kingdom, each surrounded by spreading darkness.\n\"We can't defend them all,\" Kael said, his warrior's mind calculating their limited resources.\nArin's eyes snapped open, glowing with power. \"We must. Each breach lets more corruption through.\" She waved her hand, and the sphere zoomed in on the northern border. \"This one is the worst. I have to go there myself.\"\n\"Split up? That's too dangerous.\"\n\"We have no choice,\" Arin snapped. \"I've found something else.\" She swam to a small chest and removed a trident smaller than Kael's but crackling with ancient energy. \"This belonged to the first queen. It can stabilize a breach, but only one at a time.\"\nKael took the weapon, feeling its power hum through his arm. \"I'll take the western breach. It's closest to the military barracks-I can gather troops there.\"\n\"What about the others?\"\nKael's face darkened. \"We need Tharros and Sophia.\"\nArin placed her hand over his. For a moment, they weren't rivals for Tharros's affection but allies in a desperate fight. \"I felt them earlier. They've found something powerful on the surface.\"\n\"Can you reach them?\"\n\"I'll try.\" Arin closed her eyes, her consciousness stretching toward the surface world.\nAboard the yacht, Sophia felt a strange tingling at the base of her skull.\n\"Arin?\" she whispered.\nVictoria Shaw paused in her explanation of the Heartstone. \"Is everything alright, Dr. Rodriguez?\"\nBefore Sophia could answer, Tharros grabbed her hand, his eyes flashing gold. \"It's Arin. She's reaching out.\"\nThey stood frozen for a moment, their minds filled with urgent images-the palace crumbling, the corruption spreading, Kael fighting a losing battle.\n\"We need to go back,\" Sophia said, her heart racing. \"Now.\"\nVictoria stepped forward, her face tense. \"The modifications aren't complete. If you leave with the device half-finished-\"\n\"They're dying down there,\" Tharros growled, scales rippling across his skin.\nDr. Chen looked up from the workbench where he'd been studying the Heartstone's connections to their sphere device. \"We need another hour, maybe two.\"\nVictoria's eyes darted between them, calculating. \"There might be another way.\" She pressed a hidden panel in the wall, revealing a small safe. From inside, she removed a slim metal case.\n\"What's that?\" Sophia asked.\n\"Insurance.\" Victoria opened the case to reveal seven small, glowing objects shaped like tears. \"Barrier fragments. We've been collecting them for decades.\"\nTharros hissed, his transformation accelerating in his anger. \"You've been weakening our defenses!\"\n\"Not intentionally,\" Victoria insisted, stepping back from his growing claws. \"These were already broken, washing up after storms. My great-grandfather began collecting them, believing they were pieces of the world that saved him.\"\nSophia examined the fragments, her scientific mind racing. \"These are like smaller versions of the Heartstone.\"\n\"Yes,\" Victoria nodded. \"Each one connected to a different part of the barrier around Aquaria.\"\nChen looked up sharply. \"If we could attune these to the sphere device-\"\n\"We could stabilize multiple breaches at once,\" Sophia finished, excitement building despite her suspicion.\nTharros loomed over Victoria, now seven feet tall with scales covering half his body. \"Why didn't you mention these before?\"\nVictoria didn't flinch. \"Because they're irreplaceable. And because I wasn't sure I could trust you with all of our secrets.\" She rolled up her sleeve further, revealing more markings beyond the birthmark-patterns that matched the ancient symbols Sophia had seen in Aquaria.\n\"You're not fully human,\" Sophia realized with a gasp.\nVictoria's smile was thin. \"My great-grandfather didn't just get saved by the people of Aquaria. He fell in love with one of them. My grandmother was half-mer.\"\nThe revelation hung in the air between them. Sophia felt pieces sliding into place-Victoria's knowledge, her company's obsession with the ocean, the familiar magic Tharros had sensed in her blood.",

        "content": "\"So it wasn't just corporate interest,\" Sophia said. \"This is personal for you.\"\n\"My family has guarded the secret for generations,\" Victoria replied. \"We're the boundary keepers. There are seven families like mine around the world, descendants of those who crossed between worlds.\"\nA loud bang interrupted them as the yacht's radar system blared a warning. Chen rushed to the console. \"Military vessels approaching from the south. Three of them. Heavy weapons.\"\nTharros snarled, his transformation complete. The dragon king stood before them, golden scales gleaming in the cabin lights. \"We've run out of time.\"\nVictoria grabbed the Heartstone and thrust it into Sophia's hands. \"Take it. Complete the device underwater. The fragments will guide you to the breaches.\"\n\"What about you?\" Sophia asked.\n\"I'll buy you time.\" Victoria's eyes hardened as she looked at the approaching ships on the radar. \"It's what boundary keepers do.\"\nAs Sophia and Tharros prepared to escape, Chen working frantically to secure their equipment, Sophia felt a strange connection form between herself and Victoria-a bond of shared purpose that transcended their differences.\n\"There's something else you should know,\" Victoria said quietly, pulling Sophia aside. \"The corruption isn't just a natural phenomenon. It's being guided by something... someone.\"\n\"Who?\"\nVictoria's eyes reflected ancient knowledge and fresh fear. \"The eighth family. The one that betrayed the pact thousands of years ago.\" She pressed a small device into Sophia's hand. \"This contains everything we know about them. Be careful who you trust in Aquaria.\"\nThe yacht shuddered as the first military vessel came into range. Victoria straightened her white suit and handed Sophia the case of barrier fragments.\n\"Go. Save both our worlds.\"\nAs Sophia and Tharros slipped into the ocean depths, the device clutched tightly against her chest and the fragments glowing in their case, she couldn't shake the feeling that Victoria's revelation had changed everything.\nThe seven families of the surface.\nThe seven rulers of Aquaria.\nAnd an eighth force, moving in shadows, pulling strings on both sides.\nThe cold depths welcomed them as they descended, but Sophia knew the real darkness was still to come.\n  Family Secrets\nThe sea felt heavier than usual as Sophia and Tharros swam deeper, the sphere device pulsing between them. Military ships prowled above, searchlights cutting through the water.\n\"We need to rest,\" Sophia gasped, her newly formed gills working hard. Though her transformation had given her underwater abilities, she still wasn't as strong as a natural-born Aquarian.\nTharros nodded, his golden eyes scanning the ocean floor until he spotted a small cave. \"There.\"\nInside, they found shelter beneath a rocky overhang. Sophia laid out the seven barrier fragments on a flat stone beside the Heartstone. In the dim light of their bioluminescence, they looked like frozen tears of the ocean itself.\n\"How long until we reach Aquaria?\" she asked, checking the sphere device for damage.\n\"Six hours, maybe more,\" Tharros replied, his scales rippling with concern. \"The military activity has forced us to take a longer route.\"\nThe mention of the military ships made Sophia think of Victoria Shaw. \"Do you think she escaped?\"\nBefore Tharros could answer, a soft blue light appeared at the cave entrance. Both tensed, ready for danger, but instead of soldiers or sea creatures, a woman swam inside.\nShe moved with the grace of someone born to the water, yet wore modern diving gear. As she removed her mask, Sophia gasped. The woman looked strikingly similar to Victoria, but younger, with striking violet eyes that seemed to glow in the darkness.\n\"Dr. Rodriguez. King Tharros.\" The woman's voice was clear despite being underwater. \"I've been tracking you since you left the yacht.\"\nTharros moved protectively in front of Sophia. \"Who are you?\"\n\"My name is Elara Blackwater.\" She removed her diving gloves, revealing webbed fingers with the same birthmark Victoria had shown them. \"Victoria is my aunt. She sent me to help you.\"\nSophia felt a strange tingle of recognition at the name. \"Blackwater?\"\nElara smiled, but there was sadness in her eyes. \"Yes. A name that once belonged to Aquaria, though few would remember it now.\"\nShe swam closer, her gaze fixed on the barrier fragments. \"I see my aunt entrusted you with our collection. Good. You'll need them.\"\n\"Our collection?\" Tharros growled, suspicion clear in his voice. \"You speak as if they belong to you.\"\n\"In a way, they do.\" Elara settled on a rock, removing her oxygen tank with practiced ease. \"My family has been gathering these fragments for three generations. They call to our blood.\"\nSomething clicked in Sophia's mind. \"Blackwater... like Blacktide? Like Arin?\"\nElara's eyes widened slightly. \"You know of Arin? She still lives?\"\n\"She's one of the rulers of Aquaria,\" Sophia said. \"But I don't understand-\"\n\"She's my cousin, many times removed.\" Elara's voice dropped to almost a whisper. \"Our family was once one of the most powerful in Aquaria, until the Great Purge.\"\nEven Tharros looked shocked. \"The Purge was centuries ago. A dark time when those with mixed blood were...\"\n\"Were hunted down and banished,\" Elara finished, her voice hard. \"My ancestors fled to the surface, having just enough mer-blood to pass as human but enough to remember what was lost.\"\nShe reached into a waterproof pouch at her belt and pulled out a small crystal pendant. \"This has been passed down through my family line. It contains memories of Aquaria before the Purge.\"\nThe crystal glowed when she touched it, projecting images into the water around them-beautiful underwater cities fuller and more vibrant than the Aquaria Sophia knew, mer-people and humans swimming together, and celebrations where magic flowed freely between both worlds.\n\"This was the world before the barriers were strengthened,\" Elara explained. \"Before fear divided our peoples.\"\nTharros watched the images with a troubled expression. \"These recordings are forbidden in Aquaria. They contradict our official history.\"\n\"Of course they do,\" Elara said bitterly. \"The victors always write the history.\"\nSophia studied Elara's face, noting features that did indeed resemble Arin's-the same high cheekbones, the same determined set to her jaw.\n\"Why come to us now?\" Sophia asked.\n\"Because the corruption isn't just destroying Aquaria-it's spreading to the surface too.\" Elara gestured toward the ocean beyond their cave. \"Dead zones are appearing in oceans worldwide. Marine life is dying. And now the military has detected the energy signatures from the breaches.\"\nShe leaned forward, eyes intense. \"Oceanic Horizons has resources, technology, and people with the blood of Aquaria in their veins. We can help you fight the corruption and repair the barriers.\"\n\"For a price,\" Tharros said flatly.\nElara didn't flinch. \"Yes. We want what was promised to our ancestors-the right to return to Aquaria. Permanent access between our worlds.\"\nSophia felt the weight of this request. Opening Aquaria to the surface world would change everything.\n\"The other rulers would never agree,\" Tharros said.\n\"They might, when they learn the truth.\" Elara's voice softened. \"The corruption feeds on the division between our worlds. The barriers were never meant to be permanent, only a temporary measure until both sides could heal from the war.\"\nShe touched the Heartstone gently. \"This stone doesn't just amplify magic-it remembers. It holds the original covenant between land and sea.\"\nSophia looked at Tharros, seeing the conflict in his eyes. They needed help, desperately, but the price was the very isolation that had protected Aquaria for millennia.\n\"What about Victoria?\" Sophia asked, suddenly remembering. \"The military-\"\n\"She's safe,\" Elara assured her. \"Oceanic Horizons has powerful friends. But the military knows something is happening. They've deployed underwater drones all along the coast. Getting to Aquaria won't be easy.\"\nTharros moved to the cave entrance, looking out at the dark water. \"We don't have time for debate. Aquaria is falling. We need to reach the breaches.\"\n\"I can help with that too.\" Elara removed something else from her pouch-a small metal disk etched with familiar symbols. \"This can create a temporary portal directly to Aquaria. To Arin.\"\nShe held it out. \"It's calibrated to her magical signature. Blood calls to blood.\"\nTharros looked suspicious. \"Such magic is impossible.\"\n\"Not impossible,\" Elara said. \"Just forgotten.\" She placed the disk on the cave floor between them. \"I'll prove it.\"\nBefore either could stop her, Elara pricked her finger with a small knife and let a drop of blood fall onto the disk. The symbols began to glow, swirling with blue-green light.\n\"Now you,\" she said to Sophia. \"Your connection to all three rulers will strengthen the portal.\"\nSophia hesitated, looking at Tharros. He nodded reluctantly.\nWith a deep breath, Sophia pricked her finger and added her blood to the disk. The light intensified, spinning faster.\n\"Stand back,\" Elara warned.\nThe water around the disk began to swirl, forming a whirlpool that grew until it was large enough for a person to swim through. Through the swirling currents, Sophia caught glimpses of coral towers and bioluminescent streets-Aquaria.\n\"It worked,\" she whispered in amazement.\n\"Of course it did.\" Elara smiled, and for the first time, Sophia saw a flash of something familiar in her eyes-the same calculating look she'd sometimes noticed in Arin's gaze.\n\"The portal will only last a few minutes,\" Elara explained. \"Enough time for you to pass through with the device.\"\nTharros gathered the barrier fragments and the Heartstone, still wary. \"And you?\"\n\"I'll follow, but through a different route.\" Elara's expression turned serious. \"There's something else you should know before you go. About the eighth family-the betrayers.\"\nShe swam closer, lowering her voice. \"They didn't just betray the pact. They created the corruption, as a weapon to destroy both worlds if they couldn't rule them.\"\nSophia felt a chill that had nothing to do with the cold water. \"Who are they?\"\n\"They hide behind many names, but in Aquaria, they were once known as the Voidcallers.\" Elara's face hardened. \"And they've infiltrated the highest levels of Aquarian society.\"\nThe portal began to flicker, signaling its instability.\n\"You must go now,\" Elara urged. \"Trust no one until you've spoken with Arin.\"\nAs Sophia and Tharros prepared to swim through, Elara caught Sophia's arm. \"One last thing. Tell Arin... tell her the Blackwater line still remembers the old songs.\"\nWith that cryptic message, Elara raised her hand toward the portal. The water around her fingers began to glow with purple light-magic, raw and powerful, just like Arin's.\n\"Impossible,\" Tharros breathed. \"She's surface-born...\"\nElara's eyes flashed with power as she stabilized the portal. \"Not everything about our family was forgotten, Dragon King. Some secrets run in the blood.\"\nThe portal pulsed once more, and Sophia knew they had to leave now or be stranded. As they swam into the swirling vortex, the last thing she saw was Elara Blackwater, surrounded by purple magic, her expression a mixture of triumph and sorrow.\nThe future of both worlds hung in the balance, and Sophia couldn't shake the feeling that they had just made either their greatest ally-or their most dangerous enemy.\n The Temporary Base\nThe portal spat Sophia and Tharros out into Arin's chamber with a rush of swirling water. They tumbled onto the floor, coughing and disoriented.\n\"You made it!\" Arin rushed forward, her pale hands trembling as she touched their faces. \"I felt the portal open but couldn't believe it.\"\nKael burst into the room, trident ready. \"What happened? I felt a surge of-\" He froze at the sight of Sophia and Tharros. \"How did you get here?\"\nSophia struggled to her feet, the Heartstone clutched to her chest. \"We have a lot to explain, but first-how bad is it?\"\nThe answer came in the form of a violent tremor that shook the entire palace. Pieces of coral ceiling crumbled around them.\n\"That bad,\" Kael said grimly.\nTharros pulled himself to his full height, water streaming from his scales. \"The corruption has breached the inner defenses. We brought help.\" He nodded to the Heartstone and the barrier fragments that Sophia carefully laid out on Arin's worktable.\nArin gasped, her fingers hovering over the fragments. \"These are... impossible. They've been lost for centuries.\"\n\"Not lost,\" Sophia said. \"Collected. By your family.\"\nArin's head snapped up. \"What?\"\n\"Your cousin. Elara Blackwater.\"\nThe color drained from Arin's already pale face. \"The Blackwaters were destroyed in the Purge. No one survived.\"\n\"Some escaped to the surface,\" Tharros said quietly. \"They've been watching us. Waiting.\"\nAnother tremor, stronger than the last, sent magical instruments crashing to the floor.\n\"We don't have time for this now,\" Kael insisted. \"The eastern sector has fallen completely. The northern barriers are failing. Whatever help you've brought, we need it immediately.\"\nSophia straightened, her scientist's mind already calculating possibilities. \"We need to get back to the surface. To the Oceanic Research Institute.\"\n\"The surface?\" Kael looked at her like she'd lost her mind. \"That's where we just escaped from!\"\n\"And it's where we'll find the technology we need,\" Sophia insisted. \"Elara said her company has resources. If we combine their tech with Aquarian magic...\"\nTharros nodded slowly. \"The Heartstone could bridge the two.\"\n\"It's too dangerous,\" Kael argued. \"The military-\"\n\"Will be handled by Oceanic Horizons,\" Sophia said with more confidence than she felt. \"But we need all of us. Arin's magic, Kael's knowledge of the barriers, Tharros's connection to the Heartstone, and my understanding of the technology.\"\nThe four rulers of Aquaria looked at each other, an unspoken understanding passing between them. Their kingdom was dying. They had no choice.\n\"How do we get there?\" Arin asked.\nSophia smiled and pulled out the metal disk Elara had given them. \"The same way we got here.\"\nThree days later, the Oceanic Research Institute hummed with frantic activity. What had once been sterile laboratories were now filled with an impossible mix of cutting-edge technology and ancient magic.\nSophia stood in the central command room, which had been converted from the main aquarium tank. Holographic displays showing the status of Aquaria's barriers floated beside bubbling tanks of magical coral. Scientists in lab coats worked alongside mer-people who had followed their rulers to the surface.\n\"Dr. Rodriguez!\" Dr. Chen called from across the room. \"The quantum stabilizers are ready for the next test.\"\nSophia nodded, brushing a strand of wet hair from her face. She hadn't been fully dry in days, splitting her time between underwater work and surface coordination.\nVictoria Shaw entered the room, flanked by two security officers. Despite the chaos of recent days, she still managed to look perfectly put together in her white suit.\n\"The government representatives have been delayed again,\" she announced with a slight smile. \"Our legal team convinced them that inspections would violate at least seventeen proprietary technology agreements.\"\n\"How long will that hold them?\" Sophia asked.\n\"A few days. Maybe less.\" Victoria glanced at the wall of security monitors showing military vehicles parked at the perimeter of the facility. \"They're getting impatient.\"\n\"Then we need to work faster,\" Sophia said, turning back to the central platform where Tharros and Kael were carefully positioning the Heartstone.\nThe stone sat in a specially designed cradle, surrounded by the seven barrier fragments arranged in a perfect circle. Each fragment was connected to sophisticated equipment that monitored and amplified its energy.\nArin floated in a tank nearby, her hair swirling around her as she chanted ancient spells. The water around her glowed with purple light, tendrils of magic extending out to touch each fragment.\n\"Are we ready?\" Sophia asked, approaching the platform.\nTharros nodded, his human form still showing hints of scales along his neck. \"The stone recognizes its children. It wants to be whole again.\"\n\"The barrier fragments are responding to Arin's magic,\" Kael added. \"But we need more power to establish a stable connection.\"\nSophia turned to the bank of computers where a team of scientists monitored energy levels. \"Dr. Chen, initiate the quantum field.\"\nChen's fingers flew across the keyboard. \"Quantum field activating in three... two... one...\"\nA low hum filled the room as the equipment surrounding the Heartstone powered up. The stone's blue-green glow intensified, pulsing in rhythm with the barrier fragments.\nArin's chanting grew louder, her eyes glowing with ancient power. \"The barriers are answering! I can feel them!\"\nOn the holographic displays, the eight breach points in Aquaria flashed red, then yellow, as the energy from the Heartstone reached them.\n\"It's working,\" Sophia breathed, her heart racing. \"The quantum field is stabilizing the magical energy.\"\nVictoria moved closer, her eyes fixed on the Heartstone. \"My great-grandfather always said it wanted to go home.\"\n\"Energy levels at seventy percent,\" Chen called out. \"Breach one stabilizing... breach two stabilizing...\"",

        "content": "Sophia felt a surge of hope. This could actually work. They could save Aquaria without opening it completely to the surface world-a temporary solution that would buy them time to find a permanent one.\nThen, without warning, alarms blared throughout the facility. The security monitors flickered, showing heavily armed soldiers approaching the main gates.\n\"They're overriding our security protocols,\" Victoria said, urgency in her voice. \"Someone gave them access codes.\"\n\"The eighth family,\" Tharros growled. \"The Voidcallers.\"\n\"We need more time!\" Sophia shouted over the alarms. \"The connection isn't stable yet!\"\nKael grabbed his trident. \"I'll hold them off.\"\n\"No!\" Sophia caught his arm. \"We need you here. Your connection to the barriers is vital.\" She turned to Victoria. \"Can your security team delay them?\"\nVictoria was already on her phone. \"They'll try, but against military forces...\"\nAnother alarm sounded, this one from the equipment monitoring the Heartstone. The stone's glow had become erratic, pulsing faster and brighter.\n\"Something's wrong,\" Chen yelled. \"The energy patterns are fluctuating!\"\nArin's voice echoed from her tank. \"The breaches in Aquaria-they're changing! Something is forcing them wider!\"\nSophia rushed to the monitoring station. The holographic map showed the corruption surging through the partially stabilized breaches, as if something was deliberately counteracting their efforts.\n\"It knows what we're doing,\" Tharros said, his voice filled with dread. \"The corruption is fighting back.\"\nThe facility shook as an explosion rocked the entrance. On the security monitors, soldiers poured through the damaged gates.\n\"We're out of time,\" Victoria said.\nSophia looked at the struggling connection between the Heartstone and the barriers, then at the approaching soldiers. A desperate idea formed in her mind.\n\"We need to channel all power to one breach instead of eight,\" she said quickly. \"Create one stable pathway rather than trying to fix everything at once.\"\n\"Which breach?\" Kael asked.\nSophia pointed to the holographic map, to the breach nearest the palace. \"This one. If we can secure a stable channel between this facility and the palace, we can move everyone and everything through it before the military takes control.\"\n\"A bridge between worlds,\" Tharros murmured. \"It could work.\"\n\"Do it,\" Victoria commanded, already organizing her staff for evacuation.\nSophia and Chen quickly recalibrated the equipment, redirecting all power to a single barrier fragment. Arin focused her spells, while Tharros and Kael placed their hands directly on the Heartstone, channeling their connection to Aquaria.\nThe stone's light stabilized, becoming a steady, brilliant beam that shot from the fragment toward the ceiling. The air above the platform began to shimmer and distort.\n\"It's opening!\" someone shouted.\nThe shimmering air split open, revealing a swirling portal of water and light. Through it, they could see the coral palace of Aquaria, damaged but still standing.\n\"Energy signature stabilizing,\" Chen reported, his voice filled with awe. \"The quantum field is harmonizing with the magical frequency.\"\nSophia stepped toward the portal, hardly daring to believe they'd succeeded. She reached out, her fingers passing through the boundary with nothing more than a tingle of energy.\n\"It's stable,\" she confirmed, joy spreading through her despite the chaos around them. \"We've created a direct channel between worlds.\"\nVictoria was already organizing the evacuation. \"Everyone, gather essential equipment and prepare to move through! Security teams, defensive positions!\"\nAs scientists and mer-people began rushing to collect their work, Sophia turned to her three partners. In their faces, she saw the same mix of hope and determination that she felt.\n\"We did it,\" she said softly.\nTharros took her hand. \"This is just the beginning.\"\nAnother explosion shook the building, closer this time. The military was fighting its way in.\nThrough the portal, more Aquarians appeared, warriors summoned by Kael to help defend the bridge between worlds. They emerged from the water with weapons ready, scales gleaming under the harsh laboratory lights.\nAs the first soldiers burst into the command room, Sophia stood with Tharros, Kael, and Arin in front of the portal-four rulers united in defense of both their worlds.\nThe Heartstone pulsed between them, its light growing stronger as their resolve hardened. The bridge was open. Now they just had to hold it long enough to save everyone.\nAnd somewhere, in both worlds, the corruption continued to spread, guided by the unseen hand of the Voidcallers.\nPoison Tide\nThe temporary bridge between worlds had been open for five days. Five days of frantic activity as equipment, people, and knowledge flowed between the Oceanic Research Institute and the underwater palace of Aquaria.\nSophia hadn't slept more than four hours at a stretch, her body running on adrenaline and determination. Standing on the institute's roof under the early morning sun, she finally allowed herself a moment to breathe.\n\"Beautiful, isn't it?\" Tharros appeared beside her, his human form still showing faint scales along his neck that caught the sunlight.\n\"The calm before the storm,\" Sophia replied, her eyes fixed on the horizon where military vessels patrolled just beyond the institute's property line. \"Victoria says they'll make another attempt to breach our security by noon.\"\nTharros's jaw tightened. \"We'll be ready.\"\nA strange sound drew their attention seaward-a seagull's cry that twisted halfway through into something unnatural. The bird spiraled down, hitting the water with a splash. It didn't resurface.\n\"That's the third one today,\" Sophia said, a chill running through her despite the warm sun.\nBelow them, the institute's private dock showed signs of something wrong. The usually clear water had taken on a faint purplish tinge. A small school of fish floated belly-up near the pilings.\n\"It's following us,\" Tharros said grimly. \"The corruption has found our bridge.\"\nSophia's stomach dropped. \"We need to tell the others.\"\nThe command room buzzed with voices as Sophia and Tharros shared what they'd seen. Kael slammed his fist against the table, rattling equipment.\n\"We should have expected this,\" he growled. \"The corruption isn't mindless. It hunts.\"\nArin floated in her tank, her pale fingers tracing patterns that left glowing symbols in the water. \"The barrier we created isn't just letting us through. It's letting the corruption out.\"\nDr. Chen approached with a tablet, his face grim. \"Three researchers have reported skin rashes with unusual patterns. Two more are experiencing auditory hallucinations.\"\n\"How long?\" Sophia asked, her scientist's mind already calculating possibilities and solutions.\n\"First symptoms appeared twelve hours ago,\" Chen replied. \"Progressing rapidly.\"\nVictoria Shaw entered the room, flanked by her security team. Unlike the chaos around her, she remained perfectly composed, though Sophia noticed dark circles under her makeup.\n\"The military's medical team is requesting access,\" Victoria said. \"They're detecting 'biological anomalies' in the water surrounding our facility.\"\n\"We can't let them in,\" Kael insisted. \"If they see the portal-\"\n\"If we don't address the corruption spreading to surface waters, we won't need to worry about the portal,\" Sophia interrupted. \"They'll have a real ecological disaster to investigate.\"\nArin's voice echoed from her tank, haunting and musical. \"The corruption feeds on fear. The more they panic, the faster it will spread.\"\nA sudden commotion at the side entrance drew everyone's attention. Two security guards helped a third who stumbled between them, his eyes unfocused, skin gleaming with sweat. Purple veins stood out against his neck.\n\"Marcus collapsed during his patrol of the eastern perimeter,\" one guard explained. \"He was checking reports of dead fish washing up.\"\nMarcus looked up, his eyes suddenly focusing on Sophia with unnatural sharpness. \"I can hear them,\" he whispered. \"Voices in the deep, calling, calling...\"\nThe security guard convulsed, his back arching. When his eyes opened again, the pupils had changed-vertical slits, like a reptile's.\n\"The Voidcallers send their regards,\" he hissed in a voice not his own. Then he collapsed, unconscious.\nSophia felt cold fear grip her heart as medical staff rushed to help. This was worse than she'd imagined. The corruption wasn't just affecting the water-it was spreading to people.\n\"We need to contain this,\" she said, turning to her three partners. \"Now.\"\nTharros nodded, his human disguise slipping further as anger rippled through him. Scales spread across his cheeks, his eyes turning to molten gold. \"I can purify small areas with dragon fire. It's temporary, but it might slow the spread.\"\n\"I'll help coordinate from Aquaria,\" Kael said, gripping his trident. \"Our warriors can patrol the underwater boundaries of the institute.\"\n\"And I'll adapt my barrier spells,\" Arin added, her hands still moving in complex patterns. \"If we can't close the bridge yet, we can at least try to filter what passes through it.\"\nSophia watched Marcus being carried away, his body still twitching. Science and magic, surface and sea-they'd succeeded in building a bridge, but at what cost?\nThe institute's beachfront had been evacuated, yellow caution tape fluttering in the breeze. Dead fish littered the sand, their scales showing the same purple tinge Sophia had noticed earlier. The stench was overwhelming.\nSophia stood at a safe distance with Dr. Chen and a small team equipped with specialized sensors. All wore protective gear-not that it would matter if the corruption truly decided to take them.\n\"Ready?\" Sophia asked through her mask.\nChen nodded, adjusting his monitoring equipment. \"Recording all wavelengths. If there's energy involved, we'll detect it.\"\nFurther down the beach, Victoria Shaw kept military observers at bay with a barrage of legal documents and carefully crafted excuses. The standoff wouldn't last much longer.\nTharros walked alone to the water's edge, barefoot and shirtless despite the cool breeze. Even in human form, his presence commanded attention, an ancient power barely contained by fragile flesh.\n\"He's magnificent,\" Chen murmured beside her, then looked embarrassed. \"Scientifically speaking, of course.\"\nSophia smiled despite their dire circumstances. \"Of course.\"\nTharros reached the waterline and paused, his toes touching the contaminated surf. He closed his eyes, his chest expanding as he drew in a deep breath. Then another. And another.\nThe air around him began to shimmer with heat.\n\"Energy readings spiking,\" Chen reported, his voice tight with excitement. \"Temperature increasing exponentially.\"\nTharros opened his eyes, now blazing with inner fire. When he spoke, his voice carried across the beach despite the crashing waves.\n\"I am Tharros, Dragon King of Aquaria, Master of the Deep Currents, Keeper of Ancient Flame.\" Each title seemed to make him stand taller, his human form stretching, changing. \"By my right as ruler, I command this corruption to cease.\"\nScales erupted across his skin, no longer just hints but a full transformation. His spine elongated, shoulders broadening impossibly. What stood at the water's edge was no longer human-shaped but a magnificent hybrid-part man, part dragon, fully terrifying.\nBehind her, Sophia heard gasps and curses from the research team. Someone dropped a tablet with a clatter. But she couldn't look away from Tharros.\nHe raised his arms, now ending in clawed hands, toward the sky. His chest glowed orange from within, like a forge heating up.\n\"Fire cleanses,\" he roared. \"Fire purifies!\"\nHe brought his hands down toward the water, and from his mouth erupted a stream of blue-white flame so intense Sophia had to shield her eyes. The fire didn't behave like normal flame-it flowed like liquid, spreading across the water's surface in expanding rings.\nWhere the dragon-fire touched, the purple tinge in the water hissed and steamed away. Dead fish turned to ash. The very air seemed to clear.\n\"It's working,\" Chen whispered in awe. \"The contamination levels are dropping.\"\nBut Sophia saw the strain on Tharros's face, the way his transformed body trembled with effort. This power came at a cost.\nWhen the last of the flame dissipated, Tharros fell to his knees in the surf. The transformation reversed itself, scales receding, body returning to human proportions. By the time Sophia reached him, he looked human again, though utterly exhausted.\n\"You didn't tell me it would drain you like this,\" she said, helping him to his feet.\nHe gave her a weak smile. \"Would it have mattered?\"\n\"No,\" she admitted. \"But I would have prepared better.\"\nBehind them, the research team stood frozen, instruments forgotten as they stared at what they'd just witnessed. Science and myth had collided before their eyes, leaving their worldview in shambles.\nAnd beyond them, at the perimeter, military personnel had stopped listening to Victoria's legal arguments. Their attention was fixed on the beach where a man had just transformed and breathed fire.\n\"We have a problem,\" Victoria said, approaching rapidly. \"They saw everything. They're calling for backup.\"\nSophia looked at Tharros, then at the now-clean water, already showing faint purple tendrils returning at its edges. His cleansing was temporary. The corruption couldn't be burned away so easily.\n\"Get everyone back to the portal,\" she told Victoria. \"We need to accelerate the evacuation.\"\n\"And the military?\" Victoria asked.\nSophia looked at the soldiers who were now advancing, weapons drawn. \"They're the least of our worries.\"\nAs if in answer, a tremor shook the ground beneath their feet. Out in the bay, the water began to churn, a massive whirlpool forming where no current should exist.\nFrom its center rose something vast and dark, purple corruption dripping from scaled tentacles that reached toward the sky.\n\"The Voidcallers,\" Tharros whispered, his exhausted body tensing once more. \"They've found us.\"\nExposed Secrets\nThe massive tentacled creature rising from the bay froze everyone in place-soldiers, scientists, and mer-people alike. Then, as suddenly as it appeared, it sank back beneath the waves, leaving only churning purple water as evidence it had ever existed.\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Sophia shouted, breaking the spell. \"Everyone back to the portal!\"\nThe research team scrambled into action, but it was too late for secrecy. Military personnel were already radioing their command, their voices carrying across the suddenly quiet beach.\n\"...unknown creature, at least fifty feet tall...\" \"...civilian transformed into some kind of reptilian hybrid...\" \"...requesting immediate backup and containment protocols...\"\nVictoria snatched Sophia's arm as they hurried toward the institute. \"Someone's livestreaming.\" She pointed to a small fishing boat just offshore, a civilian with a phone held high above his head.\nSophia's stomach dropped. \"How much did he capture?\"\n\"Everything,\" Victoria replied grimly. \"Tharros, the creature, all of it.\"\nInside the institute's main building, chaos reigned. Scientists rushed to pack equipment while security teams barricaded entrances. Kael and a group of mer-warriors emerged from the portal, weapons ready.\n\"The corruption is attacking the palace's eastern wing,\" Kael reported, water still streaming from his armor. \"We've evacuated the children and elders to the deep caverns, but our defenses are failing.\"\nDr. Chen rushed toward them, his tablet displaying multiple news feeds. \"It's already online,\" he said breathlessly. \"The footage. It's everywhere.\"\nSophia watched in horror as shaky video played across the screen. There was Tharros, transforming into his dragon form, breathing blue fire across the water. Then the massive tentacled thing rising from the bay. The clip ended with military personnel drawing weapons.\n\"Seventeen million views in six minutes,\" Chen said. \"Every major news outlet is picking it up.\"\nOutside, the wail of sirens grew closer. Helicopter rotors thundered overhead.\n\"We need to move everything through the portal now,\" Kael insisted. \"Seal it behind us.\"\n\"And abandon the surface to the corruption?\" Sophia asked. \"It won't stay contained. You saw how quickly it spread.\"\nTharros, still weak from his cleansing effort, leaned against a table. \"The Voidcallers want this,\" he said quietly. \"Fear between our worlds feeds their power.\"\nA massive explosion rocked the building as the military breached the outer perimeter. Glass shattered. Warning lights flashed.\n\"We have fifteen minutes before they reach the command center,\" Victoria said, checking security feeds. \"Maybe less.\"\nChen cleared his throat. \"There's another way.\"\nEveryone turned to look at him.\n\"We can't hide anymore,\" he said, gesturing to the news feeds where \"MONSTERS REAL!\" headlines screamed across the screen. \"But we can control the narrative.\"\n\"What are you suggesting?\" Sophia asked.\n\"A controlled disclosure,\" Chen replied. \"We give them a version of the truth they can handle. One that doesn't cause mass panic.\"\n\"You want us to lie?\" Kael scoffed.\n\"I want us to survive,\" Chen shot back with unexpected force. \"All of us-surface and sea. If humans believe you're all monsters, they'll try to destroy you. If the corruption spreads unchecked, it will destroy everything.\"\nAnother explosion, closer this time. The lights flickered.\n\"What exactly did you have in mind?\" Victoria asked, her business mind already calculating possibilities.\nChen pointed to Sophia. \"People trust scientists. She explains that we've discovered an ancient underwater civilization that's been living peacefully alongside humanity for centuries. We frame the corruption as an environmental threat affecting both worlds. We ask for cooperation, not conflict.\"\n\"It could work,\" Arin said, surprising everyone. She had emerged from her water tank and stood dripping on the floor. \"Humans fear what they don't understand. Give them understanding, and fear becomes curiosity.\"\nSophia looked at each of her partners' faces. \"We'd need to simplify a lot. Leave out the magical aspects-\"\n\"And my true nature,\" Tharros added, a muscle twitching in his jaw.\n\"For now,\" Sophia agreed. \"We present you as ambassadors from an advanced underwater civilization. We focus on the corruption as the common enemy.\"\nVictoria was already on her phone. \"I can set up a live broadcast. All major networks. Ten minutes.\"\n\"The military won't just stand down,\" Kael warned.\n\"They will if their superiors order it,\" Victoria replied. \"I still have friends in high places. I'll buy us time.\"\nSophia felt the weight of worlds settling on her shoulders. \"This changes everything. There's no going back.\"\n\"There never was,\" Tharros said gently. \"Not since the moment you pulled me from the deep.\"\nAnother explosion, and the institute's power grid failed. Emergency lights bathed everyone in eerie red.\n\"Nine minutes,\" Victoria said, tapping furiously on her phone. \"The broadcast studio on level two still has generator power.\"\nSophia took a deep breath. \"Chen, help me script this. Victoria, make your calls. Tharros, Kael, Arin-choose what parts of your world you're willing to reveal.\"\nAs everyone rushed to their tasks, Sophia caught Tharros watching her.\n\"Having second thoughts?\" he asked.\n\"A million of them,\" she admitted. \"But we're out of options.\"\nEight minutes later, Sophia stood in the small broadcast studio, makeup hastily applied to hide her exhaustion. Behind her, a blue screen would be replaced with carefully selected footage of Aquaria-the beautiful parts, nothing to inspire fear.\nVictoria gave her a thumbs up from behind the camera. \"You're live in thirty seconds. Every major network and streaming platform worldwide.\"\nSophia smoothed her lab coat, her fingers trembling. Through the studio's window, she could see military personnel being held back by Victoria's security team. How long that standoff would last, she couldn't guess.\nDr. Chen handed her a tablet with their hastily prepared script. \"Remember, keep it simple. Focus on cooperation. Position yourself as the bridge between worlds.\"\nTwenty seconds.\nTharros approached, now fully human in appearance again. He took her free hand. \"You can do this.\"\n\"What if I make it worse?\" she whispered.\n\"You won't,\" he said with absolute certainty. \"This is why the Heartstone chose you. Not just for Aquaria, but for this moment.\"\nTen seconds.\nKael and Arin joined them, standing just out of camera range. Despite their differences, all three of her partners looked at her with the same expression-trust.\nFive seconds.\nSophia set down the tablet. She wouldn't need the script. She knew what needed to be said.\nThree. Two. One.\nThe red light on the camera blinked on.",

        "content": "\"My name is Dr. Sophia Rodriguez,\" she began, her voice steadier than she felt. \"What I'm about to tell you will change how you see our world forever.\"\nBehind the camera, Victoria's phone lit up with incoming calls from government officials. Military commanders shouted orders outside the door. But for this brief moment, the world was listening.\n\"Today, humanity is not alone,\" Sophia continued. \"We share this planet with another civilization, one that has lived beneath the waves since before recorded history.\"\nOn cue, carefully edited footage of Aquaria's bioluminescent cities appeared beside her on screen.\n\"I am not here to cause fear. I am here because both our worlds face the same threat-a biological contaminant spreading through our oceans.\"\nThe feed switched to sanitized images of the purple corruption.\n\"This is not an invasion. This is an opportunity for unprecedented cooperation between surface and sea.\"\nOutside, something massive rose from the ocean again, purple tentacles reaching toward the institute. Military helicopters swarmed it like angry wasps, weapons firing.\nBut inside the studio, Sophia continued calmly, unaware of the chaos, focused only on finding the right words to save both worlds.\n\"What happens next is up to all of us,\" she said, looking directly into the camera. \"We can choose fear, or we can choose a new beginning.\"\nThe building shook. The generator sputtered. The broadcast feed wavered.\n\"The people of Aquaria extend their hands in friendship,\" Sophia said, her voice growing urgent as warning lights flashed around her. \"Will humanity accept?\"\nThe feed cut to static just as the studio door burst open, soldiers rushing in with weapons raised.\n\"On the ground! Now!\" they shouted.\nSophia stood her ground, Tharros, Kael and Arin moving protectively beside her.\n\"Did it work?\" she asked Victoria, ignoring the soldiers.\nVictoria was still staring at her phone, messages flooding in faster than she could read them. She looked up, eyes wide with disbelief.\n\"It's trending everywhere. #OceanNeighbors. #SaveTwoWorlds.\" She smiled faintly. \"The President is calling for an immediate ceasefire and diplomatic contact.\"\nA soldier stepped forward, his weapon lowering slightly. \"Dr. Rodriguez? I have orders to escort you to Washington immediately.\" He glanced nervously at Tharros, Kael, and Arin. \"All of you.\"\nOutside, the sound of weapons fire had stopped. The building no longer shook.\n\"And the creature in the bay?\" Sophia asked.\n\"Retreated,\" the soldier replied. \"About thirty seconds into your broadcast. Just... disappeared beneath the waves.\"\nSophia exchanged looks with her partners. The Voidcallers hadn't expected this turn of events. Fear was their weapon-but she had just replaced fear with curiosity and hope.\nIt was only the beginning, she knew. The hardest parts were still ahead. The corruption would return. The Voidcallers would try again. And now they had to navigate the treacherous waters of human politics on top of everything else.\nBut as she faced the soldiers, her three partners beside her, the portal to Aquaria humming in the next room, and the eyes of the world upon them, Sophia felt something unexpected.\nHope.\n\"Let's go meet the President,\" she said.\nThe New World Order\n\"The President will see you now.\"\nSophia straightened her lab coat as she entered the Oval Office. Her heart raced as she led her unusual delegation-Tharros, Kael, and Arin-into the most powerful room in the human world.\nThe President rose from behind his desk, eyes widening slightly at the sight of the three Aquarians. Despite their human appearance, something about them radiated otherworldliness.\n\"Dr. Rodriguez,\" he said, extending his hand. \"Your broadcast has created quite a stir.\"\n\"Mr. President,\" Sophia replied, her voice steadier than she felt. \"Thank you for agreeing to meet us.\"\nSecret Service agents lined the walls, hands hovering near their weapons. The tension in the room felt thick enough to cut.\n\"So,\" the President said, gesturing for them to sit, \"you claim these individuals are representatives of an underwater civilization?\"\nTharros stepped forward, his presence commanding even in his human form. \"I am King Tharros of Aquaria. For thousands of years, our worlds have existed side by side, neither interfering with the other.\"\n\"Until now,\" the President noted.\n\"Until now,\" Tharros agreed, \"because we face a common threat.\"\nOutside the windows, protestors and supporters clashed beyond the White House gates. Signs reading \"ALIENS GO HOME\" competed with others proclaiming \"SAVE OUR OCEANS TOGETHER.\"\nVictoria slipped into the room, tablet in hand. \"Sir, we're trending worldwide. Public opinion is splitting 60-40 in our favor.\"\nThe President frowned. \"And the military?\"\n\"Standing down, as ordered,\" Victoria replied. \"But they're maintaining surveillance.\"\nSophia pulled up images of the purple corruption on a nearby screen. \"This contaminant spreads through water, affecting all life it touches. It began in our oceans but won't stay there.\"\n\"And your people have been fighting it?\" the President asked.\nKael nodded, his warrior's posture unmistakable. \"For months. We're losing ground.\"\n\"Why come to us now?\"\n\"Because we need each other,\" Sophia said simply. \"Human science combined with Aquarian knowledge might be our only chance.\"\nThe President studied them with shrewd eyes. \"You're not telling me everything.\"\nSophia exchanged glances with her partners. How much could they safely reveal?\n\"The corruption is not just biological,\" Arin said, speaking for the first time. Her melodic voice seemed to ripple through the room. \"It feeds on fear and division. Those feelings make it stronger.\"\n\"Convenient,\" the President muttered.\nA phone rang, interrupting them. The President answered, his expression growing grave.\n\"When? How bad?\" He hung up, turning to them with new urgency. \"The corruption has been spotted in the Potomac River. It's spreading faster than your reports indicated.\"\nSophia felt cold dread wash over her. \"It's adapting.\"\n\"Show me,\" the President demanded.\nMinutes later, they stood at the river's edge. Purple tendrils snaked through the water, killing fish and turning vegetation black. Military personnel kept bystanders back while scientists in hazmat suits collected samples.\n\"It wasn't supposed to reach here for weeks,\" Tharros said, his face grim.\nSophia watched the President's expression shift from skepticism to genuine concern. This was the turning point-would he choose cooperation or conflict?\n\"What do you need from us?\" he finally asked.\nSophia took a deep breath. \"A joint research facility. Access to your environmental agencies. And most importantly, public support for our alliance.\"\nThe President nodded slowly. \"And in return?\"\n\"Knowledge,\" Tharros replied. \"Of our medicines, our technologies, our understanding of the oceans.\"\n\"Not weapons?\"\n\"Tools for healing, not destruction,\" Arin clarified.",

        "content": "As they returned to the White House, Sophia noticed the protestors had grown quieter, watching news feeds of the corruption spreading through the river.\nIn the Situation Room, government officials and Aquarian representatives gathered around a large table. Maps showed purple spots appearing across coastlines worldwide.\n\"The public needs reassurance,\" Victoria advised. \"Another broadcast, this time with government backing.\"\nThe President agreed. \"Dr. Rodriguez will continue as our official liaison with Aquaria. We'll frame this as an environmental crisis requiring international cooperation.\"\n\"And when people ask about the dragon?\" Sophia questioned.\nSilence fell across the room.\n\"They saw what they saw,\" the President finally said. \"We'll acknowledge that there are species unknown to modern science, but emphasize peaceful coexistence.\"\nHours later, Sophia stood beside the President for a joint address to the nation. Gone was her hastily applied makeup from the first broadcast; now she looked polished, professional-the perfect bridge between worlds.\n\"Fellow citizens,\" the President began, \"today we face an unprecedented situation, but also an unprecedented opportunity...\"\nAs he spoke, Sophia watched the faces of her partners. Tharros looked regal and composed, but she could sense his unease at revealing even this sanitized version of their existence. Kael remained vigilant, eyes constantly scanning for threats. Arin seemed most at peace, perhaps because deception had always been part of her survival.\nWhen it was Sophia's turn to speak, she kept her message simple.\n\"The people of Aquaria have knowledge that can help us fight this corruption. We have technologies that can heal our oceans. Working together, we can save both our worlds.\"\nThe response was immediate. Social media exploded with support. Environmental groups pledged allegiance. Religious leaders called for peace and understanding.\nBut not everyone welcomed the news.\nAs they left the White House, a small drone darted past security, hovering in front of Tharros. Before anyone could react, it projected a holographic message.\n\"We know what you really are, dragon king. The Voidcallers have friends everywhere. This is just the beginning.\"\nThe drone exploded in a flash of purple light, leaving a small, smoking crater in the pavement.\nSophia felt Tharros tense beside her. \"They're here,\" he whispered. \"On the surface.\"\nThat night, in their heavily guarded hotel suite, the four partners gathered to assess their situation.\n\"The corruption is spreading faster than we predicted,\" Kael reported, studying data from Aquarian scouts. \"And now we know the Voidcallers have human allies.\"\n\"We need to return to Aquaria,\" Arin insisted. \"The palace defenses won't hold much longer without us.\"\nSophia paced the room, her mind racing. \"If we leave now, we risk losing human support. But if we stay...\"\n\"We risk losing our home,\" Tharros finished.\nA knock at the door interrupted them. Dr. Chen entered, looking exhausted but excited.\n\"I've been analyzing the river samples,\" he said, spreading papers across the table. \"The corruption reacts to electrical fields. If we can generate the right frequency-\"\n\"We might slow it down,\" Sophia realized, hope flaring in her chest.\n\"Or make it stronger,\" Arin cautioned. \"Magic and electricity share certain properties.\"\nAs they debated their next steps, Sophia's phone chimed with a news alert. She froze, staring at the screen.\n\"What is it?\" Tharros asked, moving to her side.\nSophia turned the phone so they all could see. A live video showed massive purple tentacles rising from oceans around the world-New York, Tokyo, Sydney, Rio de Janeiro-all at the same moment.\n\"It's coordinated,\" Kael whispered.\n\"It's a message,\" Tharros corrected.\nThe video feed switched to a figure shrouded in purple mist, its features impossible to distinguish.\n\"People of Earth,\" it hissed, \"your new friends have not told you everything. The creatures you welcome today will destroy you tomorrow. We offer protection-but only if you reject these invaders.\"\nThe broadcast cut to scenes of destruction-cities in flames, people fleeing in terror. But Sophia recognized the footage from old disaster movies, cleverly edited to look current.\n\"They're turning humans against us,\" Arin whispered.\nSophia's phone rang-the President.\n\"Tell me that wasn't real,\" he demanded.\n\"It wasn't,\" Sophia assured him. \"But what comes next might be worse.\"\nAs she hung up, the hotel lights flickered, then failed completely. In the sudden darkness, something scratched at their window-twenty stories above the ground.\n\"They found us,\" Tharros growled, his eyes glowing in the darkness as his human disguise began to slip.\nThe window exploded inward, showering them with glass as a purple tendril snaked into the room.\nSophia reached for her partners' hands, feeling their power flow through her. Whatever came next, they would face it together.\nBut deep in her heart, a terrible question formed: had they already lost the war for public opinion before it had truly begun?\nShining Through Darkness\nThe purple tendril whipped through the hotel room, knocking furniture aside as it searched for them. Sophia ducked behind an overturned table, her heart hammering against her ribs.\n\"Get down!\" Kael shouted, pulling Arin to safety as the tendril lashed out again.\nTharros stood his ground, eyes blazing with inner fire. His human disguise flickered as scales rippled across his skin. With a growl that was more dragon than man, he grabbed the writhing tendril with bare hands.\nSteam rose where they touched. The tendril twisted and thrashed, but Tharros held firm.\n\"Sophia,\" he called, voice strained. \"The device Chen mentioned-would it work here?\"\nHer mind raced. \"Maybe! If we can create the right electrical frequency...\"\nArin slid across the floor to Sophia's side. \"I can channel power, but I need something to focus it through.\"\nDr. Chen, who had been cowering by the door, suddenly straightened. \"The hotel's backup generator! If we can modify it-\"\n\"Go!\" Sophia ordered. \"Kael, protect him!\"\nAs they rushed from the room, Sophia grabbed the hotel's desk lamp, ripping out its wiring. Her fingers moved with surprising confidence as she dismantled the electrical components.\n\"Can you hold it?\" she asked Tharros, who was still struggling with the thrashing tendril.\nSweat beaded on his forehead. \"Not much longer.\"\nArin placed her hands over Sophia's as they worked on the improvised device. \"Focus your energy through me,\" she instructed. \"Think of it as an extension of your will.\"\nSophia closed her eyes, feeling the strange tingle of magic mixing with science. The lamp's broken parts began to glow with blue light.\n\"Now!\" Arin cried.\nSophia thrust the makeshift device against the tendril. A pulse of energy shot through it, sending blue light racing along its purple length. The tendril stiffened, then withered, crumbling into dust that scattered across the hotel carpet.\nSilence fell over the room.\n\"Did we kill it?\" Sophia asked, breathing hard.\n\"No,\" Tharros said grimly, rubbing his burned hands. \"We just made it retreat.\"\nThe door burst open as Kael returned with Dr. Chen and a bewildered hotel maintenance worker.\n\"We've got the generator ready,\" Kael announced, then stopped short at the sight of the destroyed room. \"Looks like we're too late.\"\n\"Not too late,\" Sophia said, holding up their improvised device. \"Too early. This works, but on a small scale. We need something bigger-much bigger.\"\nThree days later, Sophia stood in the center of a massive warehouse the government had converted into their command center. Scientists, military personnel, and Aquarian representatives worked side by side, assembling what they now called \"purification nodes.\"\n\"The President's approval ratings are up twelve points,\" Victoria reported, joining Sophia at the central planning table. \"Your latest press conference did wonders.\"\nSophia barely heard her. She was focused on the map spread before her, marking key locations along coastlines worldwide.\n\"These energy signatures match what we've seen at the corruption points,\" she explained to the team gathered around her. \"If we place nodes at each location, we can create a barrier the corruption can't cross.\"\n\"And what about the Voidcallers' propaganda?\" asked a stern-faced general. \"We're still seeing those fake disaster videos spreading online.\"\n\"That's why we need visible results,\" Sophia replied. \"Actions speak louder than words.\"\nAcross the warehouse, Tharros stood near a large water tank, eyes closed in concentration. The water swirled unnaturally, forming images only he could interpret. Sophia watched him with concern. Each connection with Aquaria drained his strength, but they desperately needed information from below.\nKael approached her, voice low. \"He's been at it for hours. The strain is showing.\"\n\"I know,\" Sophia sighed. \"But without direct contact with Aquaria-\"\n\"We're flying blind,\" Kael finished. \"The corruption has damaged most of our communication relays.\"\nArin joined them, her usual composure slipping. \"The eastern districts have fallen. Many of our people are fleeing to the deep caverns, but they won't survive there long-term.\"\nSophia squeezed her hand, offering what comfort she could. \"We'll be ready to deploy tomorrow. Just one more day.\"\nA shout from across the room interrupted them. Tharros had collapsed beside the water tank, water spilling across the floor. They rushed to his side.\n\"Tharros!\" Sophia cradled his head. \"What happened?\"\nHis eyes fluttered open, unfocused at first. \"I saw... I saw them. The Voidcallers. They're not what we thought.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Kael demanded.\nTharros struggled to sit up. \"They're not invaders. They're refugees, fleeing something worse.\"\nSilence fell across the warehouse as everyone turned to listen.\n\"That doesn't excuse what they're doing,\" Arin said sharply.\n\"No,\" Tharros agreed. \"But it explains why our usual defenses fail. They're desperate. And they've found a way to open a permanent portal between their realm and ours.\"\nSophia felt cold dread settle in her stomach. \"Where?\"\n\"The Marianas Trench. The deepest point in your oceans.\"\nDr. Chen rushed over with his tablet. \"That matches our latest satellite data. There's a massive energy disturbance there-something we've never seen before.\"\nSophia turned to Victoria. \"We need to adjust our plan. Some of these nodes must be placed at the trench.\"\n\"That's impossible,\" the general cut in. \"No equipment can function at that depth.\"\nA small smile crossed Tharros's face. \"Human equipment, perhaps. But we have alternatives.\"\nThe next morning, Sophia stood on the deck of a naval carrier, watching teams load the purification nodes onto helicopters and submarines. Each device gleamed with a combination of technology and magic-circuit boards etched with ancient Aquarian symbols, power cores infused with essence from the Heartstone.\n\"Twenty-four deployment teams,\" Victoria reported. \"All synchronized to activate at exactly 3:00 PM Eastern time.\"\nSophia nodded, her attention drawn to three special nodes set apart from the others. These were larger, more complex, and hummed with barely contained energy. They were destined for the Marianas Trench-carried by Tharros, Kael, and Arin themselves.\n\"The President is asking for assurances this will work,\" Victoria continued.\n\"There are no assurances,\" Sophia replied honestly. \"Just hope.\"\nShe found her partners near the edge of the deck, gazing out at the ocean. Even in their human forms, they seemed to be calling to the water below.\n\"It's time,\" she said, joining them.\nTharros turned to her, his eyes reflecting both determination and fear. \"You should stay here. Coordinate from the surface.\"\nSophia shook her head. \"We do this together or not at all.\"",

        "content": "\"The trench is too deep for you,\" Kael argued. \"Your transformation isn't complete.\"\n\"I've modified my diving gear,\" she countered. \"It will hold until we reach the portal.\"\nArin touched Sophia's cheek gently. \"You're as stubborn as a sea turtle.\"\n\"I learned from the best,\" Sophia smiled.\nAround them, the carrier bustled with final preparations. News helicopters circled overhead, broadcasting the mission to an anxious world. Social media had dubbed it \"Operation Blue Light\"-a name that had caught on faster than any government designation.\nDr. Chen approached, carrying a small device. \"A final addition,\" he said, handing it to Sophia. \"It's calibrated to your unique energy signature. If things go wrong at the trench...\"\n\"A backup plan,\" Sophia nodded, securing it to her belt. \"Thank you.\"\nAs the sun climbed higher, the time for departure grew near. Sophia gazed at her three partners-the dragon king who had captured her heart, the warrior who had taught her strength, and the sea witch who had shown her magic's true nature.\n\"Whatever happens,\" she said softly, \"I'm grateful for finding you all.\"\nTharros leaned forward, pressing his forehead against hers. \"This isn't an ending, Sophia. It's a beginning.\"\nThe aircraft carrier's horn blasted, signaling the start of the mission. Around the world, teams moved into position, carrying hope in the form of glowing blue devices.\nSophia took a deep breath as she zipped up her specialized diving suit. Her transformation wasn't complete, but she could feel it continuing-scales forming beneath her skin, lungs adapting to process water as well as air.\n\"Operation Blue Light commences in T-minus sixty minutes,\" announced a voice over the loudspeakers.\nThe four of them stood at the edge of the carrier, looking down at the dark water below. Somewhere in those depths, a portal spewed corruption into their world. Somewhere in those depths, the fate of two realms would be decided.\n\"Ready?\" Sophia asked, her voice steady despite her racing heart.\nWithout waiting for an answer, she jumped first, diving into the cold embrace of the ocean. The splash she made was small-almost delicate-but the ripples would soon grow into waves that would change everything.\nHer partners followed, their human forms melting away as they entered their true element. Tharros's massive dragon shape cut through the water, Kael's powerful mer-form propelled him downward with incredible speed, and Arin's witch-lights illuminated their descent.\nAs Sophia kicked deeper, adjusting her breathing apparatus, a single thought filled her mind:\nThe deepest darkness is where light shines brightest.\nBut whether their light would be enough to close the portal, only time would tell.\nWorlds Collide\nThe deeper they dove, the darker the ocean became. Sophia's specialized diving suit glowed with soft blue light, helping her see through the murky water. Even with her partial transformation, the pressure squeezed her chest, making each breath a struggle.\nAhead, Tharros's massive dragon form cut through the water, his scales shimmering like living metal. Kael swam in graceful arcs, his powerful mer-tail propelling him forward. Arin's hands wove patterns in the water, creating a protective bubble that helped shield them from the worst of the pressure.\n\"How much further?\" Sophia asked through their communication system.\n\"We're approaching the edge of the trench,\" Tharros replied, his voice rumbling even through the water. \"But something's wrong.\"\nThe water ahead had turned an unnatural purple, swirling with dark energy. Tendrils of corruption reached up from the depths like grasping fingers.\n\"They know we're coming,\" Kael said grimly.\nSophia checked her watch. \"Twenty minutes until global activation. We need to place our nodes at the source.\"\nArin pointed downward. \"There. I can sense the portal's energy signature.\"\nFar below, a pulsing purple light marked the spot where the Voidcallers had torn through the fabric between realms. Even from this distance, Sophia could feel its wrongness-like a splinter in reality itself.\n\"I'll go first,\" Tharros decided, diving deeper.\nThe corruption thickened as they descended. Purple tendrils brushed against them, testing, probing. One wrapped around Sophia's ankle, sending icy pain shooting up her leg. She cried out, struggling to free herself.\nKael was at her side in an instant, slicing through the tendril with his blade. \"Stay close,\" he warned.\nAt the bottom of the trench, the portal pulsed like a sick heart. It wasn't large-perhaps the size of a car-but its edges constantly shifted and stretched, trying to grow wider.\n\"The nodes,\" Sophia reminded them, fighting through the pain in her leg. \"We need to position them in a triangle around the portal.\"\nEach of them carried one of the special purification nodes. Designed to work in harmony, the devices would create a stabilizing field that would allow natural magic to flow while keeping the corruption contained.\nTharros placed his node first, wedging it firmly into the ocean floor. It activated immediately, glowing with bright blue light that pushed back the purple darkness.\n\"Hurry,\" he urged. \"The corruption is fighting back.\"\nKael swam to the opposite side, placing the second node. Its blue light joined with the first, creating a shimmering arc across the portal.\nAs Arin moved to position the third node, a massive tendril burst from the portal itself, wrapping around her waist and yanking her toward the opening.\n\"Arin!\" Sophia screamed, pushing off the ocean floor toward her friend.\nArin struggled against the tendril's grip, her face contorted with pain. The node slipped from her hands, tumbling toward the abyss.\nWithout thinking, Sophia dove after it. The pain in her leg forgotten, she pushed herself faster than she'd ever moved in water before. Her fingers closed around the device just as another tendril whipped toward her face.\nShe twisted away, but not quickly enough. The tendril slashed across her diving mask, cracking it. Water began to seep in.\n\"Sophia!\" Tharros roared, swimming toward her.\nBut Sophia wasn't listening. Her focus narrowed to one task-placing the final node. With water filling her mask, she kicked toward the third position in their triangle.\nFive minutes until global activation.\nAbove them, Kael had managed to free Arin from the tendril's grip. They fought side by side, keeping the corruption at bay while Sophia completed their mission.\nSophia's lungs burned. Her diving system was failing, and she wasn't transformed enough to breathe water naturally. Black spots danced at the edges of her vision as she forced herself forward.\nThree minutes.\nWith the last of her strength, she slammed the third node into position. It activated instantly, completing the triangle. Blue light surged from all three devices, connecting in a perfect triangle around the portal.\nTwo minutes.\nSophia felt herself drifting, consciousness slipping away as water filled her lungs. Then strong arms wrapped around her waist. Through blurry eyes, she saw Tharros's face, human again, his expression fierce with determination.\nOne minute.\nAcross the world, teams moved into position. On beaches and ships, in submarines and diving bells, humans and Aquarians worked together to activate the remaining purification nodes. In the White House situation room, the President watched anxiously as dots of blue light appeared on their global map.\nThirty seconds.\nIn the trench, Tharros tore Sophia's damaged mask away. She gasped, water rushing into her mouth. But instead of drowning, something miraculous happened. The partial transformation inside her body accelerated, driven by desperation and the magic surrounding them. Gills opened along her neck, drawing oxygen from the water.\nTen seconds.\n\"Breathe, Sophia,\" Tharros urged. \"Just breathe.\"\nShe did, and for the first time, water flowed through her newly formed gills, bringing blessed oxygen to her starving lungs.\nThree... two... one...\nAcross the globe, all purification nodes activated simultaneously. A wave of blue energy spread outward from each device, creating a network of light that encircled the planet. Where the energy waves met, they strengthened each other, forming a stable barrier that allowed natural magic to flow while repelling corruption.\nIn the trench, the effect was immediate and dramatic. The portal shuddered, its edges contracting as the blue energy forced it closed. Purple tendrils withered and dissolved. The water cleared, returning to its natural dark blue.",

        "content": "\"It's working!\" Arin exclaimed, watching as the corruption retreated.\nBut their victory was short-lived. From the shrinking portal came a final, desperate attack. Not tendrils this time, but a wave of pure dark energy that spread outward like an underwater explosion.\n\"Brace yourselves!\" Kael shouted.\nThe four of them huddled together as the wave hit them. Instead of pain, Sophia felt a strange connection forming between them-stronger than anything they'd experienced before. Their bodies began to glow, each with their unique signature: Tharros's fiery gold, Kael's steady silver, Arin's mysterious green, and Sophia's bright blue.\nThe colors swirled together, creating a protective sphere around them. Where the dark energy touched their combined light, it transformed, becoming pure and clear again.\n\"What's happening?\" Sophia asked, her voice echoing strangely through the water.\n\"The prophecy,\" Arin whispered. \"Our bond is completing itself.\"\nThrough their connected minds, Sophia suddenly understood. The barrier between worlds had been artificially strengthened thousands of years ago, cutting off the natural flow of magic between surface and sea. The purification nodes weren't just fighting corruption-they were restoring balance.\nAs the portal finally closed with a flash of light, a new sensation spread through the ocean. Everywhere, the natural magic of the sea began to reach toward the surface, while the forgotten magic of the land reached downward. Where they met, they strengthened each other, creating a bridge between worlds.\nIn Aquaria, bioluminescent cities shone brighter than they had in centuries. On land, plants near coastlines burst into unprecedented growth. Animals long thought mythical began to stir from hidden places, awakening to a world newly infused with ancient magic.\nThe four partners floated in the deep trench, their glowing bodies still connected by threads of light. Through their bond, Sophia could feel what was happening around the world-the restoration of something precious that had been broken long ago.\n\"We did it,\" she said, wonder filling her voice.\n\"No,\" Tharros corrected gently. \"We've only begun.\"\nKael pointed upward, where strange lights now danced across the ocean. \"The barrier isn't gone-it's transformed. Now it will filter, not block.\"\n\"But the Voidcallers,\" Sophia began.\n\"Were never our true enemy,\" Arin finished. \"Just symptoms of the imbalance.\"\nAs they began their slow ascent from the trench, Sophia felt the changes in her body solidifying. The transformation that had begun when she first met Tharros was completing itself. Not turning her fully mer, or witch, or dragon, but something new-a bridge between all worlds.\nOn the surface, celebrations had begun as reports came in of the corruption retreating worldwide. The President prepared to address a waiting nation. Dr. Chen analyzed the readings from their sensors, his face alight with scientific wonder.\nBut deep in the Mariana Trench, something stirred in the space where the portal had been. A tiny crack, no bigger than a fingernail, remained in the fabric of reality. Through it seeped not purple corruption, but something else entirely-something ancient and patient, drawn by the sudden surge of magic in a world long denied to it.\nAs Sophia and her partners rose toward the waiting ships, they remained unaware of what watched them from that tiny crack-something that had been waiting thousands of years for the barriers to weaken.\nSomething that whispered a single word into the dark waters:\n\"Finally.\"\nNew Beginnings\nThe tiny crack at the bottom of the ocean pulsed with strange light. One week had passed since they closed the portal, yet Sophia couldn't shake the feeling that something watched them. Standing on the deck of the Genesis research vessel, she gazed at the horizon where ocean met sky.\n\"Penny for your thoughts?\" Kael's voice startled her.\nSophia turned to find him looking almost human in jeans and a t-shirt. His silver eyes were hidden behind sunglasses, but nothing could disguise the graceful way he moved.\n\"Just wondering what's next,\" she admitted. \"I never thought I'd see you up here.\"\nKael smiled, joining her at the railing. \"The new connection between worlds makes it possible. Arin's magic helps too.\"\nAs if summoned by her name, Arin appeared from below deck. Her green hair fluttered in the breeze, drawing curious glances from the crew.\n\"Tharros is coming,\" she announced. \"He's bringing news from Aquaria.\"\nSophia's heart quickened. Since their battle at the trench, Tharros had been busy rebuilding the underwater kingdom's defenses. This would be their first reunion as a complete group.\nThe water near the ship bubbled and churned. Scientists rushed to the railing, cameras ready. With a splash that sent water spraying across the deck, Tharros emerged in human form, leaping onto the ship with inhuman grace.\n\"Show-off,\" Kael muttered, but his eyes sparkled with affection.\nTharros shook water from his golden hair. His eyes found Sophia immediately, and the bond between them hummed with energy.\n\"You're late,\" she said, fighting a smile.\n\"Kings are never late,\" he replied, pulling her into a fierce hug that lifted her feet off the deck. \"Everyone else is simply early.\"\nDr. Chen approached, clipboard in hand. \"If you're done with the reunion, we have work to do. The readings from the trench are... concerning.\"\nInside the ship's laboratory, holographic displays showed the ocean floor. The crack that had appeared after the portal closed had grown.\n\"It's spreading,\" Dr. Chen explained. \"And releasing some kind of energy we can't identify.\"\nArin placed her hand over one of the displays. Green light flowed from her fingers, enhancing the image. \"It's not Void energy. It's older. Ancient.\"\n\"Can we close it like we did the portal?\" Sophia asked.\nTharros shook his head. \"The purification nodes won't work. This isn't corruption-it's transformation.\"\n\"What does that mean?\" Kael demanded.\n\"It means our worlds are changing,\" Arin said softly. \"The balance we restored is creating something new.\"\nSophia felt a tingle along her neck where her gills had formed during the battle. \"We need to see it up close. All of us.\"\nDr. Chen frowned. \"Another diving mission? After what happened last time?\"\n\"Not diving,\" Sophia said. \"Something better.\"\nAn hour later, they stood in a circle on the rear deck. The crew had been ordered to stay inside, giving them privacy.\n\"Are you sure about this?\" Kael asked, squeezing Sophia's hand.\n\"No,\" she admitted. \"But I can feel the change inside me. I think we all can.\"\nIt was true. Since the battle, their bond had grown stronger. Sophia could sense the others' emotions, sometimes even their thoughts. The partial transformation that had saved her life continued to evolve.\n\"Together, then,\" Tharros said, completing their circle.\nThey joined hands. Immediately, their unique energies began to flow between them-Tharros's fiery gold, Kael's steady silver, Arin's mysterious green, and Sophia's bright blue.\n\"Focus on the crack,\" Arin instructed. \"See through the water, through the darkness.\"\nSophia closed her eyes. In her mind, she dove deep, racing past coral reefs and schools of fish, down into the midnight zone where no light penetrated. Except now, she wasn't alone. She could feel the others with her, their combined consciousness moving as one.\nWhen they reached the crack, Sophia gasped. It wasn't just a tear in reality-it was a doorway. Through it, she glimpsed another world, one filled with swirling colors and impossible shapes.\n\"What is that place?\" she whispered, her voice echoing strangely in their shared vision.\n\"The realm between realms,\" Tharros answered. \"Where magic was born.\"\nAs they watched, tendrils of energy-not purple corruption, but rainbow light-reached through the crack toward them.\n\"It's calling to us,\" Kael realized.\n\"No,\" Arin corrected. \"It's calling to what we've become. Together.\"\nThe tendrils touched their merged consciousness. Instead of pain, Sophia felt a rush of knowledge. Images flooded her mind-ancient Aquaria before the barriers, humans and mer swimming side by side, dragons soaring over both land and sea.\n\"This is how it was,\" Tharros breathed. \"Before the separation.\"\n\"And how it could be again,\" added a new voice.\nThey weren't alone in the vision. A figure materialized before them, neither human nor Aquarian, but something else entirely. Its body seemed made of living water and light.\n\"Who are you?\" Sophia asked.\n\"I am what remains of the First Balance,\" the figure replied. \"Long ago, your ancestors feared the mixing of worlds and magic. They created barriers that were never meant to exist. Your actions have begun to heal this ancient wound.\"\n\"The crack-you're coming through it,\" Kael said, his tone wary.\n\"Not just me. The true nature of your world wants to return.\" The figure gestured to the rainbow tendrils. \"But the healing has only begun. The forces that fear change are already moving against you.\"\nAs if summoned by these words, darkness began to seep around the edges of the crack. Not the purple corruption they had fought before, but something slick and oily that seemed to repel the rainbow light.\n\"It's adapting,\" Arin realized. \"Learning from our last encounter.\"\n\"The nodes won't work again,\" the figure confirmed. \"This enemy evolves. It feeds on separation and fear.\"\n\"Then what do we do?\" Sophia asked.\nThe figure's gaze fell on her. \"Your group represents what was lost-dragon, mer, witch, and human, working as one. But to truly heal the world, the barriers must fall completely.\"\n\"You want us to merge the surface and underwater worlds?\" Tharros looked shocked. \"That would change everything. Millions of lives would be affected.\"\n\"Millions of lives are already at risk,\" the figure countered. \"The corruption grows stronger each day. Your temporary measures buy time, nothing more.\"\nThe darkness around the crack pulsed, growing thicker. Tendrils of rainbow light fought against it, but they were being pushed back.\n\"We need to go,\" Arin warned. \"Our physical bodies can't maintain this connection much longer.\"\nAs their shared vision began to fade, the figure reached toward them one last time. \"Find the seven ancient keystones. They were created as a failsafe, should the barriers ever need to fall. United, they can complete what you've begun.\"\n\"Where are they?\" Kael asked urgently.\n\"Scattered. Hidden. Three in Aquaria, three on land, and one in the place between.\"\nThe vision shattered. Sophia gasped as her consciousness slammed back into her body. She stumbled, nearly falling to the deck.\nStrong arms caught her-Tharros. His face was pale, his eyes troubled.\n\"Did everyone see that?\" she asked.\nNods all around. Even Dr. Chen, who had been watching from the laboratory window, rushed out to join them.\n\"Your bodies were glowing,\" he said excitedly. \"We recorded the most amazing energy readings!\"\nBut Sophia barely heard him. Her mind raced with the implications of what they'd learned. \"We need to find those keystones.\"\n\"And quickly,\" Arin added, her face grim. \"That darkness was already stronger than the corruption we fought before.\"\nKael's expression hardened into determination. \"We'll need to split up. We can cover more ground.\"\nThe words sent a chill through Sophia. Their strength had always been in unity. Separation seemed dangerous, especially now.\nTharros must have sensed her fear. He took her hand, his touch warm and reassuring. \"Even apart, our bond remains. We'll stay connected.\"\n\"Three in Aquaria, three on land,\" Sophia repeated. \"Tharros and Kael should search underwater. Arin and I will take the surface.\"\n\"And the seventh?\" Arin asked. \"The one in 'the place between'?\"\nSophia looked out at the ocean, where somewhere far below, a crack in reality was slowly widening. \"We'll find that one together.\"\nAs they began planning their search, Sophia couldn't shake a growing sense of dread. The figure had said the keystones were created as a failsafe. But what exactly would happen when all seven were united? Would merging their worlds truly save them-or create something even more dangerous?\nAnd somewhere in the deepest trench, watching through that tiny crack, something ancient and patient continued to whisper:\n\"Soon.\"\nEchoes of Lost Atlantis\nThe ancient scroll crackled under Tharros's fingers as he carefully unrolled it across the stone table. Dust particles danced in the beam of blue light emanating from the crystal lamps mounted on the archive walls.\n\"Are you sure this is the right one?\" Kael asked, leaning over the dragon king's shoulder. His silver eyes narrowed as he studied the faded markings.\n\"This is it,\" Tharros confirmed. His voice echoed through the vast chamber of the Royal Archives, a hidden section beneath the palace that few even knew existed. \"The map Sophia decoded points directly here.\"\nThree weeks had passed since they'd closed the portal in the Mariana Trench. Three weeks of celebrations, recovery, and planning. But while the immediate threat had been contained, Sophia's discovery in the ancient texts suggested something more troubling was coming.\n\"The keystones,\" Kael murmured, tracing the spiral pattern on the scroll with his finger. \"Four artifacts from before the separation of worlds.\"\nTharros nodded, his golden eyes reflecting the crystal light. \"The scroll says the first one is hidden here, protected by magic most have forgotten.\"\nThe archives stretched around them, endless shelves filled with the collected knowledge of Aquarian civilization. Waterproof scrolls, crystal tablets, and memory pearls containing the thoughts of long-dead scholars lined the walls in neat rows.\n\"There,\" Kael pointed to a symbol on the scroll that matched a marking carved into the floor nearby. \"The entrance should be beneath that tile.\"\nTogether, they moved to the spot. The tile looked like any other-smooth blue stone etched with the royal crest of Aquaria. Tharros pressed his palm against it, sending a pulse of magic through the floor.\nNothing happened.\n\"Perhaps it requires both of us,\" Kael suggested. \"The prophecy speaks of combined power.\"\nThey placed their hands side by side on the cold stone. Immediately, Tharros felt the familiar warmth spread through his arm-the same sensation he experienced whenever their magic connected. Kael's silver energy mixed with his golden power, creating a swirling pattern that sank into the tile.\nWith a low rumble, the floor shifted. The tile sank downward, then slid aside, revealing a narrow passage glowing with strange blue light.\n\"After you, Your Majesty,\" Kael said with a small smile.\nTharros snorted. \"Always so formal, even when we're about to risk our lives.\"\n\"Old habits,\" Kael replied as they descended into the passage.\nThe tunnel sloped steeply downward, leading them deeper beneath the palace than Tharros had ever ventured. The walls were lined with an unknown material that seemed to pulse with its own inner light.\n\"This architecture doesn't match anything in Aquaria,\" Tharros observed, running his hand along the smooth surface. \"It feels... older.\"\n\"Much older,\" Kael agreed. \"Like something from before the Great Division.\"\nThe tunnel suddenly opened into a circular chamber. In the center stood a pedestal carved from a single piece of luminescent crystal. Atop it sat a small object-a six-sided crystal the size of Tharros's palm, pulsing with blue-green light.\n\"The First Keystone,\" Tharros breathed.\nAs they approached, the crystal pulsed more rapidly, as if recognizing their presence. Runes were carved into each face, similar to the ones that had appeared on Sophia's skin during her transformation.\n\"Should we wait for the others?\" Kael asked, hesitating.\nTharros shook his head. \"The text was clear-retrieving each keystone requires different combinations of our abilities. This one needs dragon and mer magic.\"\nHe reached for the crystal, but Kael caught his wrist.\n\"Wait,\" the mer warrior warned. \"Look at the floor.\"\nSurrounding the pedestal was a ring of symbols-ancient warnings etched into the stone.\n\"It's protected,\" Kael translated. \"We'll need to disarm the trap first.\"\nTharros examined the symbols more carefully. \"Not disarm... satisfy. It wants proof we're the rightful retrievers.\"\nUnderstanding dawned in Kael's eyes. \"Our marks.\"\nBoth men removed their shirts, revealing the magical symbols that had appeared on their skin after bonding with Sophia. Tharros's dragon mark spread across his chest like a living tattoo, while Kael's triton symbol curved along his shoulder.\nWhen they stepped closer to the pedestal, their marks began to glow. The ring of symbols on the floor responded, lighting up in sequence.\n\"Now,\" Tharros said.\nTogether they reached for the keystone. The moment their fingers touched the crystal, a blinding flash of light filled the chamber. Tharros felt a jolt of energy surge through his body, and suddenly, his mind was filled with visions.\nA vast underwater city, far larger and more advanced than modern Aquaria. Spires of crystal and gold reaching toward the surface. People with features of both human and sea creatures moving freely through water and air. Machines powered by magic. Harmony between all realms.\nThen darkness. A great conflict. The decision to separate. The keystones being hidden away as a final safeguard.\nA voice echoing across time: \"When the four reunite, the barrier between worlds will be restored to its proper form.\"\nThe vision faded, leaving Tharros gasping. Beside him, Kael's eyes were wide with shock.\n\"Did you see-\" Kael began.\n\"Yes,\" Tharros answered. \"The world before the Division. They weren't just stories.\"\nThe keystone now rested in Tharros's palm, its light dimmed to a gentle glow. But as they turned to leave, a deep rumbling shook the chamber.\n\"I think we triggered something,\" Kael warned, drawing his blade.\nThe smooth walls of the chamber began to shift. From them emerged figures-guardians shaped from living coral and crystal, their forms vaguely humanoid with weapons grown from their limbs.\n\"Run!\" Tharros shouted, clutching the keystone tightly.\nThey sprinted back toward the tunnel, the guardians in close pursuit. Shards of crystal flew past Tharros's head as the creatures attacked. One caught him across the shoulder, drawing blood.\nKael spun, slashing at the nearest guardian with his blade. The creature shattered, only to reform moments later.\n\"They can't be killed!\" Kael called. \"They're part of the security system!\"\nThey reached the tunnel, but more guardians were emerging from the walls ahead, blocking their escape.\n\"Other way!\" Tharros decided, pulling Kael down a side passage that had appeared during the chaos.\nThis new tunnel twisted and turned, sloping ever deeper. The guardians followed relentlessly, their crystalline bodies making an eerie scraping sound against the walls.\n\"Where does this lead?\" Kael gasped as they ran.\n\"I have no idea,\" Tharros admitted. \"The archives didn't mention this.\"\nThe tunnel abruptly ended at a solid wall. Trapped, they turned to face the approaching guardians.\n\"Together,\" Tharros said, raising his free hand. Kael nodded, raising his own.\nTheir combined magic struck the guardians, slowing them but not stopping their advance. The keystone in Tharros's hand suddenly pulsed brighter, as if responding to their desperation.\nActing on instinct, Tharros pressed the keystone against the wall behind them. The stone surface rippled like water, and suddenly they were falling backward through what had seemed solid moments before.\nThey landed hard on a smooth floor, the wall solidifying behind them, cutting off the guardians' pursuit.\nKael recovered first, helping Tharros to his feet. \"Where are we?\"\nThey stood in a vast cavern, far larger than the chamber they'd left. And spread before them was something impossible-an ancient cityscape preserved beneath the ocean floor. Buildings of unfamiliar design stretched into the distance, illuminated by the same strange light they'd seen in the tunnel.\n\"I think,\" Tharros said slowly, \"we just found Atlantis.\"\nIn his palm, the keystone pulsed with renewed purpose. And deep within the silent city, something ancient stirred, awakening after thousands of years of slumber.\n\"Tharros,\" Kael whispered, pointing to a distant tower where a light had begun to glow. \"We're not alone down here.\"\nThe dragon king tightened his grip on the keystone. \"Let's find out who our new neighbors are.\"\nBehind them, the wall that had seemed so solid began to ripple once more.\nThe Collector's Prize\nRain poured down the windows of the sleek black car as it wound along the coastal road. Sophia peered through the glass at the angry ocean below. The waves crashed against the cliffs with unusual force, spraying foam high into the air.\n\"The sea feels wrong,\" Arin said quietly from the driver's seat. Her green eyes flicked between the road and the churning water. \"It's been getting worse since we closed the portal.\"\nSophia nodded, feeling the wrongness in her bones. Three weeks had passed since their battle in the Mariana Trench, and while they'd stopped the immediate threat, something else was brewing. The tiny crack they'd left behind was growing.\n\"Any word from Tharros and Kael?\" she asked, checking her phone again.\n\"Nothing since they entered the archives,\" Arin replied. \"The palace shields block most signals.\"\nSophia tried not to worry. Their bond would have alerted her if either man was in real danger. Still, she couldn't shake the feeling of urgency that had driven them to split up in their search.\nThe car rounded a bend, revealing a massive estate perched on the edge of the cliff. Stone walls surrounded the property, topped with security cameras that tracked their approach.\n\"That's it,\" Sophia said. \"Morrow Manor.\"\nThe iron gates opened automatically as they approached. Arin drove slowly up the curved driveway, parking in front of a sprawling mansion built of gray stone and glass.\n\"Remember the plan,\" Sophia said as they stepped out into the rain. \"We're researchers from the Oceanic Institute, interested in historical accounts of unusual ocean phenomena.\"\nArin adjusted her disguise-a professional pantsuit that hid her natural sea witch markings. \"And if he doesn't buy it?\"\n\"Then we move to plan B,\" Sophia said, patting her bag where several vials of Arin's memory-altering potion were safely tucked away.\nA butler greeted them at the door, ushering them into a grand entrance hall. The walls were lined with display cases containing maritime artifacts-ancient navigation tools, pieces of shipwrecks, and maps yellowed with age.\n\"Dr. Rodriguez and Ms. Blacktide,\" announced the butler, \"to see Mr. Morrow.\"\nFrom the shadows of a connecting room emerged a tall, thin man with silver hair and piercing blue eyes. He wore an expensive suit and a calculating smile.\n\"Welcome to my humble collection,\" said Jefferson Morrow, extending his hand. \"Though I must say, the Oceanic Institute doesn't usually send such... interesting representatives.\"\nSophia felt a chill. Something in his eyes suggested he knew more than he was letting on.\n\"We specialize in historical anomalies,\" she replied smoothly. \"Your collection is quite famous in certain circles.\"\n\"Is it now?\" Morrow's smile didn't reach his eyes. \"Well then, allow me to show you around.\"\nHe led them through room after room filled with maritime treasures. Ancient pottery recovered from shipwrecks. Ceremonial items from coastal civilizations. Charts showing mysterious ocean currents.",

        "content": "But it was in the final room that Sophia spotted what they'd come for-a small, leather-bound book in a glass case. Even from across the room, she could feel its power calling to her.\n\"Ah, I see you've noticed my prize possession,\" Morrow said, following her gaze. \"The logbook of Captain Elias Blackwater, 1692. He claimed to have found a passage to another world beneath the waves.\"\n\"May I?\" Sophia asked, gesturing to the case.\nMorrow hesitated, then nodded. \"The glass is specially treated to protect against deterioration. Please don't touch the case.\"\nSophia approached slowly, Arin at her side. Through the glass, she could make out faded script on the yellowed pages. One illustration showed seven crystal-like objects arranged in a circle, labeled in an ancient script.\n\"Seven keys to the forgotten realm,\" she murmured.\nMorrow's eyes narrowed. \"You can read that? The language has never been translated.\"\nSophia realized her mistake too late. She felt Arin tense beside her, magic gathering at her fingertips.\n\"Mr. Morrow,\" Sophia said carefully, \"I think we should be honest with each other. We know what this book contains, and we need it.\"\n\"Do you now?\" Morrow walked to a nearby desk and pressed a button. Metal shutters slid down over the windows with a heavy clang. \"I've been collecting objects related to the underwater world for forty years, Dr. Rodriguez. Did you think I wouldn't recognize what you are?\"\nHe reached up and pulled aside his collar, revealing three small slits on his neck-vestigial gills.\n\"You're Aquarian,\" Arin breathed.\n\"Half,\" Morrow corrected. \"My mother was mer, my father human. I can't survive underwater, but I inherited certain... sensitivities.\"\nHe circled them slowly. \"I've been waiting for someone to come for the book. The signs are all there-unusual tides, strange lights in deep waters, fish behaving abnormally. The barrier is failing, isn't it?\"\nSophia shared a look with Arin, then nodded. \"Yes. We managed to close a portal three weeks ago, but a crack remained. It's growing.\"\n\"And the keystones are awakening,\" Morrow concluded. \"I've felt it. That's why you're here.\"\nHe moved to the case and placed his hand on a hidden scanner. The glass slid open.\n\"I've protected this book for decades, waiting for its rightful guardians,\" he said, lifting the logbook carefully. \"But I need to know-are you trying to strengthen the barrier, or tear it down completely?\"\n\"We don't want to tear anything down,\" Sophia said firmly. \"We want balance. The natural flow between worlds that existed before the Great Division.\"\nMorrow studied her face, then Arin's. Whatever he saw seemed to satisfy him.\n\"The captain found one of the keystones,\" he explained, opening the book to a marked page. \"It showed him visions of the time before the separation. He spent his life searching for the others, but only found clues.\"\nHe pointed to a series of numbers on the page. \"These aren't just coordinates. They're a code that changes with the phases of the moon. Solve it, and you'll find the surface keystone.\"\n\"You're just giving this to us?\" Arin asked suspiciously.\nMorrow smiled sadly. \"I'm dying, Ms. Blacktide. Cancer. The doctors give me months. I'd rather see this book used for its purpose than locked away in some museum after I'm gone.\"\nHe pressed the book into Sophia's hands. As their fingers touched, she felt a spark of connection-the same feeling she experienced with Tharros, Kael, and Arin, but fainter, like an echo.\n\"You're part of this too,\" she realized. \"The prophecy.\"\n\"A minor player,\" Morrow agreed. \"A keeper, not a wielder. My role was to preserve until you came.\"\nA sudden tremor shook the building. Outside, lightning flashed across the sky, illuminating the ocean below-where a massive whirlpool had formed off the coast.\n\"It's beginning,\" Morrow said grimly. \"The corruption is spreading faster than I expected.\"\nSophia clutched the book tightly. \"We need to solve this quickly.\"\n\"Take my research too,\" Morrow said, grabbing a flash drive from his desk. \"Everything I've collected on the keystones and the ancient world.\"\nAnother tremor, stronger this time, knocked artifacts from their shelves. The lights flickered ominously.\n\"Go,\" Morrow urged. \"I've done my part. The rest is up to you.\"\nAs they rushed back to the car, Sophia glanced at her phone. Three missed calls from Dr. Chen, and a text: \"Something's happening in the ocean. News crews everywhere. Call me!\"\n\"We have a problem,\" she told Arin, showing her the screen. \"The world is noticing.\"\nArin gunned the engine, speeding back down the coastal road. The whirlpool in the ocean had grown, its center a sickly purple color that made Sophia's stomach turn. From its depths, something was rising.\n\"We need to warn Tharros and Kael,\" Sophia said, opening the ancient logbook. \"And we need to find this surface keystone immediately.\"\nAs if in answer, her phone chimed with a message from Tharros: \"Found first keystone. Also found something impossible. Get back to Aquaria now.\"\nSophia looked from the phone to the growing chaos in the ocean, her heart pounding with fear and determination.\n\"Too late,\" she murmured as dark shapes began to emerge from the whirlpool. \"It's already here.\"\nCity of Ghosts\n\"We should wait for the others,\" Kael said, his silver eyes scanning the abandoned streets of the ancient city.\nTharros shook his head, the keystone pulsing in his palm. \"There's no time. Feel that?\"\nKael nodded. A strange vibration hummed through the water around them, growing stronger by the minute. Something was awakening.\nThey stood at the edge of an impossible discovery - a complete city preserved beneath the ocean floor, hidden for thousands of years. Buildings of crystal and strange metal stretched into the darkness, their architecture unlike anything in modern Aquaria.\n\"Atlantis,\" Tharros murmured, still unable to believe it.\n\"The texts called it Lumaria,\" Kael corrected, pointing to symbols etched into a nearby column. \"The first kingdom, where all were one.\"\nThe keystone's light grew brighter as they moved deeper into the city. Strange shadows danced across the ancient structures, giving them an eerie, living quality. Though buried for millennia, no silt or decay marred the buildings. They looked as if their inhabitants had simply vanished moments ago.\n\"The tower,\" Tharros said, pointing to a massive spire that rose above the other structures. Blue light pulsed from its peak, matching the rhythm of the keystone. \"That's where we need to go.\"\nThey swam through empty plazas and past silent homes. Preserved furniture could be seen through windows, meals left half-eaten on tables, toys abandoned mid-play. It was as if the entire population had been snatched away in an instant.\n\"What happened here?\" Kael wondered, his voice hushed despite the emptiness.\nTharros shook his head. \"The Division, maybe? The texts speak of a great sacrifice to separate the worlds.\"\nAs they approached the central tower, Tharros felt the familiar pull of draconic magic - ancient and powerful, yet somehow familiar. The keystone hummed in his hand, responding to the energy.\n\"Strange,\" Kael said, touching the tower's outer wall. \"It feels alive.\"\nIndeed, beneath their fingers, the surface seemed to pulse like skin over a beating heart. Symbols similar to those on the keystone covered every inch, glowing softly in the darkness.\n\"There's no door,\" Tharros observed, swimming around the base.\nKael studied the symbols more closely. \"Maybe we don't need one.\" He placed his hand on a circular pattern. \"This matches your mark.\"\nTharros touched the dragon symbol on his chest, which had begun to glow in response to the tower. Understanding, he pressed his palm against the wall where Kael indicated.\nThe surface rippled like water, then parted, revealing an entrance. Inside, a spiral ramp wound upward through the tower's core.\n\"After you, Your Majesty,\" Kael said with a nervous smile.\nThe interior was filled with soft blue light that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere. As they ascended the ramp, they passed level after level of preserved knowledge. Crystal shelves lined with memory spheres, scrolls made of unknown material, and devices whose purpose they could only guess at.\n\"The Abyssal Archives,\" Tharros breathed. \"Not lost - hidden.\"\nOn the ramp above them, something moved. Tharros froze, signaling Kael to be still. A figure drifted into view - humanoid but clearly not human. Its body was translucent, revealing a complex network of glowing lines within. When it turned, its eyes were pools of pure blue light.\n\"Guardian,\" Kael whispered, reaching for his weapon.\nBut Tharros stayed his hand. \"Wait.\"\nThe figure studied them without speaking, its head tilted in curiosity. Then it raised a hand, pointing upward.\n\"I think it wants us to follow,\" Tharros said.\nThe guardian led them higher into the tower, past more floors of preserved knowledge. Finally, they reached the top level - a circular chamber dominated by a pool of shimmering liquid in its center. Hovering above the pool was a glowing orb the size of Tharros's head.\nThe guardian gestured toward the pool, then faded from sight.\n\"What is this place?\" Kael asked, approaching the edge of the pool cautiously.\nTharros examined the symbols carved around its rim. \"A memory vault, I think. The oldest form of Aquarian record-keeping.\"\nHe held the keystone over the pool. Immediately, the liquid began to swirl, changing colors from blue to gold. The orb above pulsed in response.\n\"I think we're supposed to...\" Tharros didn't finish the sentence. Acting on instinct, he placed the keystone in the center of the pool.\nThe effect was immediate and dramatic. The liquid engulfed the crystal, and the orb above expanded, filling the chamber with light. Images formed in the air around them - moving pictures of a world long forgotten.\nThey saw Lumaria in its glory - a vast civilization that spanned land and sea. People of mixed heritage moved freely between environments. Some had gills and lungs, others scales and skin. Dragons flew through the skies while mer-people swam the depths. Magic and technology worked in harmony.\n\"They were one people,\" Kael realized. \"Not separated as we are now.\"\nThe images shifted, showing a darker time. A shadow spreading across the land and sea. Corruption that turned friend against friend, brother against brother.\n\"The First Corruption,\" Tharros murmured, recognizing the purple energy that was all too familiar.\nThe visions continued, showing seven leaders - representatives of the main bloodlines - gathering to make a terrible decision. Using seven keystones of immense power, they performed a ritual that split their world into separate realms - land, sea, and sky - sealing the corruption away but also dividing their people forever.\nThe final image showed the seven leaders hiding the keystones, knowing that someday they might be needed again.\n\"The prophecy,\" Kael said. \"When the four reunite, the barrier between worlds will be restored to its proper form.\"\nThe orb contracted, the images fading. From the pool rose the keystone, now glowing with renewed purpose. Beside it floated a crystal tablet covered in ancient script.\nTharros took both objects carefully. \"Coordinates,\" he said, examining the tablet. \"To the other keystones.\"\nKael studied the tablet over his shoulder. \"There's more. A warning.\" His expression grew grim as he translated. \"The Division was temporary. A thousand generations was all the seal would hold.\"\n\"And how many generations has it been?\" Tharros asked, though he suspected the answer.\n\"Exactly one thousand,\" Kael replied. \"The seal is failing, Tharros. That's what the crack in the Mariana Trench really is - the beginning of the end of the Division.\"\nA tremor shook the tower, sending ancient artifacts tumbling from their shelves. The water around them vibrated with discordant energy.\n\"We need to get back,\" Tharros said, securing the keystone and tablet in his pack. \"Warn the others.\"\nAs they rushed back down the spiral ramp, the tremors intensified. The tower's inner light flickered ominously.\n\"Something's wrong,\" Kael called out. \"This doesn't feel like a natural quake.\"\nThey reached the bottom level just as a massive shock wave tore through the city. Outside, the preserved buildings began to crumble as silt and debris rained down from above.\n\"The city is waking up,\" Tharros realized with horror. \"Our presence activated something.\"\nThey burst through the tower entrance to find the ancient streets in chaos. The ground beneath them heaved and split, revealing deeper chambers below. From these openings, more translucent guardians emerged - hundreds of them, their eyes now burning red instead of blue.\n\"They're not happy we took the keystone,\" Kael said, drawing his blade.\nTharros transformed partially, scales covering his arms and back, claws extending from his fingers. \"We fight our way out.\"\nThe first wave of guardians surged toward them, forcing them back toward the tower. Though Kael's blade passed through their bodies with little effect, Tharros's dragon fire seemed to hurt them, making them retreat momentarily.\n\"There!\" Kael pointed to a gap in the swarm. \"If we can reach the city's edge, we might find another way out.\"\nThey fought their way through the ancient streets, the city crumbling around them. Above, the ocean floor that had hidden Lumaria for millennia was beginning to crack, letting in streams of water and sand.\n\"Almost there,\" Tharros called as they neared the city boundary.\nBut before they could reach it, the ground before them erupted. From the depths rose a guardian unlike the others - massive and pulsing with energy, its form shifting between humanoid and something else entirely.\n\"The Keeper,\" Kael gasped, recognizing the figure from ancient texts.\nThe Keeper's voice filled their minds, speaking a language neither understood yet somehow comprehended.\n\"The cycle begins again. The Division ends. Choose wisely, bearers of the mark.\"\nIt raised a massive hand, and the world around them twisted. Tharros felt himself being pulled in a thousand directions at once, the keystone burning against his skin.\nIn the chaos, a familiar sensation brushed against his mind - Sophia, reaching for him through their bond. He grasped the connection desperately.\n\"Sophia! We found something - ancient city - Division ending - get to the palace!\"\nThe Keeper's hand closed into a fist, and darkness claimed them both.\nMiles away, in a car speeding along a coastal highway, Sophia gasped as Tharros's message crashed into her mind. Beside her, Arin swerved the car in alarm.\n\"What is it?\" Arin demanded.\nSophia clutched the ancient logbook, her face pale. \"They're in trouble. And I think they just woke something up that's been sleeping for a very long time.\"\nIn the ocean below the cliff, the purple whirlpool grew larger, and the dark shapes moving within it began to take form.\nThe Collector's Price\nSophia gripped the ancient logbook tighter as Arin swerved the car around another hairpin turn. The coastal highway stretched before them like a ribbon, hugging cliffs that plunged straight into the churning sea below.\n\"Say it again,\" Arin demanded, her knuckles white on the steering wheel.\n\"I told you exactly what I felt,\" Sophia said, trying to keep her voice steady. \"Tharros reached out through our bond. They found some kind of ancient city, something about the Division ending, and we need to get to the palace.\"\n\"And then nothing?\" Arin's green eyes flashed with worry. \"Just... silence?\"\nSophia nodded, the emptiness in her mind where Tharros's presence should be felt like an open wound. \"It was like he was ripped away.\"\nThe purple whirlpool they'd glimpsed from the cliff edge haunted her thoughts. Those dark shapes moving beneath the surface couldn't be anything good.\n\"We can't reach the palace without help,\" Arin said, pulling into a small coastal town. \"Not with whatever's happening down there.\"\nThe town of Crescent Bay looked ordinary enough - fishing boats bobbing in the harbor, tourists browsing gift shops. But Sophia knew better. Since discovering her true nature, she'd learned to spot the hidden signs of magic woven into the human world.\n\"The Collector lives here?\" she asked as they parked near the waterfront.\nArin nodded grimly. \"Marcus Blackwood. If anyone has information about surface keystones, it's him. His family has been gathering magical artifacts for centuries.\"\n\"And he'll help us?\"\n\"For a price,\" Arin said, her mouth tightening. \"He always wants a price.\"\nThe Collector's shop sat at the end of a narrow alley, its windows dusty and filled with odd trinkets. A wooden sign swung gently in the breeze: \"Blackwood Antiquities - By Appointment Only.\"\nArin didn't bother knocking. She pushed open the door, sending a cluster of bells into frantic jingling.\nThe interior smelled of old books, sea salt, and something else - something ancient. Glass cases lined the walls, filled with objects that seemed ordinary at first glance but gave off a strange energy Sophia could feel prickling against her skin.\n\"Well, well,\" came a voice from the shadows. \"The sea witch returns to my humble shop.\"\nMarcus Blackwood emerged from behind a beaded curtain. He was younger than Sophia expected, maybe forty, with dark hair streaked with silver and eyes that seemed to shift color in the dim light. He wore an old-fashioned waistcoat covered in tiny pockets, each sewn shut with different colored threads.\n\"We need information,\" Arin said bluntly.\n\"You always do,\" Marcus replied with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. He turned to Sophia, studying her with unsettling intensity. \"And you've brought a dragon's mate with you. How interesting.\"\nSophia felt exposed under his gaze. \"How did you-\"\n\"The marks on your skin whisper secrets to those who know how to listen,\" he said, circling her like a shark. \"Three magical signatures intertwined with your own. Quite remarkable.\"\n\"We don't have time for games,\" Arin snapped. \"We need to find a keystone. One hidden on land.\"\nMarcus's eyes gleamed. \"Ah, the keystones of Lumaria. I wondered when someone would come looking.\"\nSophia's heart skipped. \"You know about them?\"",

        "content": "\"I know many things, dragon's mate.\" He gestured around the shop. \"Knowledge is my true collection.\"\n\"Will you help us?\" Sophia asked.\nMarcus tapped his fingers against a glass case containing what looked like an ordinary seashell. \"Information has value. What will you offer in exchange?\"\n\"Name your price,\" Arin said tightly.\nThe Collector smiled. \"Show me real magic, sea witch. Not those parlor tricks you perform for tourists. Show me what you truly are.\"\nArin's face paled. \"That's not wise.\"\n\"Nevertheless, that is my price.\" His voice hardened. \"Show me the magic of the depths, and I'll tell you where to find what you seek.\"\nSophia touched Arin's arm. \"We don't have a choice. Tharros and Kael are in trouble.\"\nAfter a long moment, Arin nodded. \"Very well. Step back.\"\nThe Collector's eyes glittered with anticipation as he moved behind one of his display cases.\nArin closed her eyes, breathing deeply. The air in the shop grew heavy, charged with electricity. Sophia felt her own dormant magic responding, scales rippling beneath the surface of her skin.\nWith a gesture of her hands, Arin began to weave her spell. Water vapor condensed from the air, forming swirling patterns that glowed with bioluminescence. The droplets merged into a sphere hovering between her palms, growing larger and more complex.\nInside the sphere, images formed - the underwater city of Aquaria, the coral palace, and then, to Sophia's surprise, a vision of the ancient city Tharros had discovered.\n\"Lumaria,\" Marcus whispered, his face bathed in the blue glow.\nArin's magic intensified. The water sphere expanded, filling the shop with projected images of ancient symbols and glowing runes. But as the spell grew stronger, something unexpected happened. Dark patterns - intricate spirals and jagged shapes - began forming within the light.\nSophia recognized that darkness. It was the same magic she'd glimpsed when Arin had fought off the shark attackers months ago. Magic she wasn't supposed to have.\nMarcus gasped, pointing to a particular symbol that pulsed at the center of the spell. \"The Mark of the Abyss! I knew it!\"\nArin's concentration broke, and the watery vision collapsed, splashing to the floor and vanishing in wisps of steam.\n\"Satisfied?\" she asked, her voice strained.\nMarcus's expression had changed from curiosity to reverence. He pulled back his sleeve, revealing a tattoo on his forearm - the same spiral symbol that had appeared in Arin's magic.\n\"My family has guarded the secrets of the sea people for fifteen generations,\" he said quietly. \"We've been waiting for this moment.\"\nHe hurried to a bookshelf, pulling out volumes until something clicked. The shelf swung outward, revealing a hidden alcove containing a single item - a rolled parchment sealed with black wax.\n\"The Temple of the Tides,\" he said, carefully breaking the seal. \"Hidden in the coastal cliffs ten miles north of here. The entrance appears only during the lowest tide of the year.\" He checked his watch. \"Which happens to be tonight, just after midnight.\"\nSophia studied the map he unrolled. \"This is a keystone location?\"\n\"One of three on land,\" Marcus confirmed. \"My ancestors helped hide it after the Division.\"\n\"Why are you helping us?\" Arin asked suspiciously.\nThe Collector's face turned grim. \"Because I've seen the signs too. The purple storms at sea. The strange creatures washing ashore. The Division is failing, just as the prophecies said it would.\" He fixed his gaze on Sophia. \"And you, dragon's mate, are at the center of it all.\"\nA sudden tremor shook the shop, rattling display cases and sending several artifacts crashing to the floor. Outside, people shouted in alarm.\nSophia rushed to the window. In the bay, the water had pulled back impossibly far, exposing the seabed. The purple whirlpool had grown, now visible even from shore.\n\"It's starting,\" Marcus whispered. \"The convergence of realms.\"\n\"We need to go,\" Sophia said, grabbing the map. \"Now.\"\nAs they hurried to the door, Marcus called after them. \"Sea witch!\" When Arin turned, he tossed her a small object - a coral pendant carved with the spiral symbol. \"For protection. You'll need it where you're going.\"\nBack in the car, Sophia studied the map while Arin drove north along the increasingly deserted highway. The tremors continued, stronger each time.\n\"What was that symbol he recognized?\" Sophia asked. \"The Mark of the Abyss?\"\nArin's hands tightened on the wheel. \"A story for another time.\"\n\"No more secrets, Arin. Not now.\"\nThe sea witch sighed. \"It's the mark of those who draw power directly from the deep trenches. Magic considered forbidden even in Aquaria.\" She glanced at Sophia. \"Magic I wasn't supposed to have access to.\"\nBefore Sophia could respond, her phone chimed with an emergency alert. She read it aloud: \"Tsunami warning for all coastal areas. Immediate evacuation advised.\"\nThey crested a hill, and the sight before them made them both gasp. The ocean had withdrawn at least a mile from shore, exposing shipwrecks and underwater caves never seen by human eyes. The sky above had turned an unnatural shade of purple.\nAt the center of the exposed seabed, a massive whirlpool of dark energy churned, and rising from its depths was a structure of crystal and strange metal - a tower identical to the one Tharros had described.\n\"The Temple of the Tides,\" Arin whispered. \"It's not in the cliffs. It's there.\"\nSophia felt a faint tug in her mind - the bond with Tharros flickering back to life.\n\"They're alive,\" she said, hope surging through her. \"But something's wrong. They're... changed somehow.\"\nAs if in response, the tower pulsed with blinding light. When Sophia could see again, she spotted two figures standing at its base.\nEven from this distance, she recognized Tharros and Kael. But they weren't alone. Behind them, hundreds of translucent guardians rose from the exposed seabed, their eyes glowing red in the gathering darkness.\nAnd standing before them all was a massive figure whose form shifted constantly between human and something else entirely - something ancient and terrifying.\n\"The Keeper,\" Arin whispered, her face draining of color. \"The Division has already fallen.\"\nRoyal Blood\n\"What happened to them?\" Sophia whispered, gripping the guard rail along the cliff edge.\nFar below, Tharros and Kael seemed frozen in place at the base of the crystal tower, surrounded by the strange guardians. The massive figure of the Keeper loomed behind them, its shifting form casting strange shadows across the exposed seabed.\nArin raised a hand, green magic dancing between her fingers as she tried to sense what was happening. \"They're not themselves. It's like they're... waiting.\"\n\"For what?\" Sophia asked.\n\"For us,\" Arin said grimly. \"The Keeper has them in some kind of trance. It wants all four of us together.\"\nThe pendant Marcus had given Arin began to glow, pulsing in rhythm with the tower. She studied it, frowning. \"This isn't just a protection charm. It's a key.\"\nAnother tremor shook the ground, stronger than before. The road behind them cracked, a jagged line splitting the asphalt.\n\"We can't just stand here,\" Sophia said, the emptiness in her mind where her connection to Tharros should be aching like a phantom limb. \"We have to get down there.\"\nArin pointed to a narrow path winding down the cliff face. \"That way. But be careful-the Keeper will sense us coming.\"\nAs they picked their way down the treacherous path, Sophia felt the strange energy from the exposed sea floor washing over her in waves. With each step, the dormant scales beneath her skin prickled and shifted, responding to the ancient magic.\n\"Something's not right,\" she said, pausing to catch her breath. \"This feels like the magic from the Division, but... different.\"\n\"It's not just ending,\" Arin replied, her eyes fixed on the tower. \"It's being rewritten.\"\nWhen they finally reached the bottom, the exposed seabed felt alien beneath their feet-a landscape of strange formations and glittering minerals never meant to be seen by surface dwellers. The air hung heavy with salt and electricity.\nAs they approached the tower, Sophia could make out more details. Tharros and Kael stood perfectly still, their eyes open but vacant, fixed on the massive doors of the structure. Their skin glowed with faint blue markings-the same symbols she had seen in the memory vault's visions.\nThe Keeper noticed them first. Its massive form shifted, becoming more solid as it turned toward them. When it spoke, its voice bypassed their ears and echoed directly in their minds.\n\"The four pieces gather. The cycle continues.\"\nTharros and Kael suddenly jerked to life, turning in perfect unison. Their movements were stiff, mechanical, nothing like their usual grace.\n\"Sophia,\" Tharros said, but his voice sounded hollow. \"You came.\"\nKael's silver eyes flashed, a brief moment of recognition breaking through whatever held him. \"It's a trap,\" he managed to say before his expression went blank again.\nThe Keeper raised a massive hand, and the tower doors swung open with a grinding sound that shook the ground beneath their feet.\n\"Enter,\" it commanded. \"The Division falters. The truth awaits.\"\nSophia felt an invisible force pulling her forward. Beside her, Arin struggled against the same power, the pendant around her neck glowing brighter.\n\"We don't have a choice,\" Sophia whispered. \"But stay close to me.\"\nThey stepped through the doorway together, followed by the puppet-like forms of Tharros and Kael. As soon as they crossed the threshold, the doors slammed shut behind them, plunging them into darkness.\nThen, one by one, crystals embedded in the walls began to glow, illuminating a vast circular chamber. The floor was covered in intricate mosaic patterns depicting scenes from an ancient history-the founding of Lumaria, the first corruption, the Division.\nAt the center of the room stood a pedestal holding a glowing orb similar to the one Tharros had described from the memory vault.\nThe Keeper did not follow them inside. Instead, its voice continued to echo around them.\n\"The truth of your bloodlines must be revealed before the keystones can be united. Begin in the library of ages.\"\nA section of the wall slid open, revealing a corridor lined with crystal shelves holding thousands of memory spheres, scrolls, and tablets.\nThe moment they entered this new chamber, something strange happened. Kael gasped, his eyes clearing as the vacant expression vanished. He stumbled, catching himself against a shelf.\n\"Kael!\" Sophia rushed to his side. \"Are you okay?\"\nHe blinked rapidly, looking around in confusion. \"I... yes. The Keeper's hold is gone.\" He glanced at Tharros, who remained frozen, his eyes still vacant. \"But why only me?\"\nArin studied the room carefully. \"This place is responding to you specifically.\"\nAs if to confirm her words, the crystal shelves began to glow wherever Kael moved near them. Symbols along the walls pulsed with blue light, following his movements.\n\"What is this place?\" he wondered, touching one of the glowing shelves.\nAt his touch, a hidden panel in the floor slid open, revealing a staircase spiraling downward.\n\"I think you're meant to go down there,\" Sophia said. \"Alone.\"\nFear flashed across Kael's face, quickly replaced by determination. \"Stay with Tharros. Try to break whatever hold the Keeper has on him.\"\nBefore descending, he gripped Sophia's hand tightly. \"If I don't return in ten minutes, leave without me.\"\n\"That's not happening,\" she said firmly. \"We're all getting out of here together.\"\nKael nodded, then disappeared down the stairs. The panel closed behind him, sealing him away from them.\nSophia turned her attention to Tharros, placing her hands on either side of his face. \"Tharros, can you hear me? You need to fight this.\"\nFor a moment, nothing happened. Then his eyes flickered, a hint of recognition breaking through.\n\"The connection,\" Arin said. \"Use your bond.\"\nSophia closed her eyes, focusing on the thread that connected her to Tharros-the one that had gone silent during his capture. She imagined it as a golden cord stretching between them, and poured all her energy into strengthening it.\n\"Come back to me,\" she whispered.\nDeep beneath the library, Kael found himself in a small chamber unlike anything he had ever seen in Aquaria. The walls were lined with portraits-faces that seemed strangely familiar though he had never seen them before.\nAt the center stood a basin filled with silver liquid that glowed with inner light. As he approached, the liquid began to stir, forming shapes and patterns.\n\"What is this?\" he murmured.\nWords appeared on the surface of the liquid: PLACE YOUR HAND WITHIN TO KNOW YOUR TRUTH.\nKael hesitated, then slowly lowered his hand into the basin. The liquid felt warm, embracing his skin without wetting it. Immediately, images exploded in his mind-memories that weren't his own.\nHe saw a woman with his silver eyes standing beside six other leaders, each holding a keystone. He saw battles against the first corruption, cities falling to darkness. He saw the ritual that created the Division, splitting the world into separate realms.\nAnd he saw his own bloodline, passed down through generations, always in hiding, always protected.\nWhen the visions ended, Kael jerked his hand away, gasping. The truth hit him like a physical blow.\n\"I'm descended from the royal family of Lumaria,\" he whispered. \"One of the seven who created the Division.\"\nThe wall before him shifted, revealing an alcove containing a single crystal tablet. As he lifted it, words etched themselves across its surface:\nTHE SECOND KEYSTONE LIES BENEATH THE CORAL THRONE, GUARDED BY TRIALS OF ROYAL WORTH. ONLY BLOOD OF THE SEVEN MAY PASS.\nThe chamber began to shake, dust falling from the ceiling. Kael tucked the tablet into his belt and raced back up the stairs.\nSophia was still trying to reach Tharros when the floor beneath them trembled violently. Cracks appeared in the crystal walls, and several memory spheres crashed to the floor.\nThe panel slid open, and Kael emerged, his face pale but his eyes burning with new purpose.\n\"We need to leave,\" he said urgently. \"Now.\"\n\"Tharros is still-\" Sophia began.\n\"I know how to free him,\" Kael interrupted. He pulled the crystal tablet from his belt and pressed it against Tharros's chest.\nThe reaction was immediate. Tharros gasped, his eyes clearing as he collapsed forward into Sophia's arms.\n\"What happened?\" Tharros demanded, looking around wildly. \"The Keeper-\"\n\"No time,\" Kael said, pointing to the widening cracks in the walls. \"This place is coming apart.\"\nThey ran for the main chamber, but found the tower doors still sealed. Arin's pendant glowed brighter as she approached them, and she pressed it against the center of the doors.\n\"Stand back,\" she warned.\nGreen light surged from the pendant, spreading across the doors in spiraling patterns. With a groan, they began to open.\nOutside, chaos awaited them. The exposed seabed was now covered in water that rose by the second-the ocean returning with terrifying speed. The guardians had vanished, but the Keeper remained, watching them with its shifting form.\n\"THE TRUTH IS REVEALED,\" it boomed. \"THE ROYAL BLOOD AWAKENS. SEEK THE KEYSTONES BEFORE THE WATERS RISE FULLY. THE CHOICE APPROACHES.\"\nWith those words, it dissolved into the churning waters.\n\"What did you discover down there?\" Sophia asked Kael as they scrambled toward higher ground.\n\"I know who I am,\" he said, his voice tight. \"And I know where to find the second keystone.\"\nTharros stopped, staring at Kael with a mixture of shock and resignation. \"You know.\"\n\"You suspected, didn't you?\" Kael demanded. \"How long have you known?\"\n\"I had suspicions since we first met,\" Tharros admitted. \"The silver eyes. The affinity for ancient magic. But I kept it secret to protect you.\"\n\"Protect me from what?\" Kael's voice rose with anger.\n\"From those who would use you,\" Tharros said. \"The royal bloodlines were hunted after the Division. Some believed they should never return.\"\nA massive wave crashed against the cliffs behind them, spraying them with cold seawater. The ocean was reclaiming the land with unnatural speed.\n\"We need to get to higher ground,\" Arin urged, pointing to the path they had descended earlier.\nAs they climbed, Kael's mind raced with the implications of what he had learned. Not just a warrior, but royalty from an ancient kingdom that predated Aquaria itself.\nHalfway up the cliff, Sophia paused, pointing out to sea. \"Look!\"\nWhere the tower had stood, a whirlpool had formed-not purple like before, but blue and gold, spinning with such force that it seemed to bend the very air around it.\n\"The convergence has begun,\" Tharros said grimly. \"The Division is weakening faster than we feared.\"\n\"What does this mean for us?\" Sophia asked.\n\"It means,\" Kael said, looking down at the crystal tablet in his hands, \"that we need to get to the coral throne immediately. The second keystone is hidden beneath it.\"\n\"And the trials?\" Arin asked.\nKael's expression hardened. \"They're designed to test royal worthiness. Only my blood can unlock them.\"\nAs they reached the top of the cliff, the ground shook again. A crack opened in the earth, stretching inland as far as they could see-a physical manifestation of the mystic boundary breaking down.\n\"The world is tearing itself apart,\" Sophia whispered.\n\"Not tearing apart,\" Tharros corrected, his eyes fixed on the horizon where strange lights now danced in the darkening sky. \"Becoming whole again.\"\nThe ocean continued to rise, faster than any natural tide. Whatever time they had left was running out.\nSacred Tides\n\"The coral throne,\" Sophia repeated, trying to make sense of everything. \"Where exactly is it?\"\nKael clutched the crystal tablet tightly. \"It's in the Temple of Tides, built into the northern cliffs. The entrance only appears during the lowest tide of the year.\" His silver eyes widened. \"Which happens to be tonight.\"\nTharros, still shaky from being freed from the Keeper's control, looked at the darkening sky. \"That gives us less than three hours.\"\nAnother tremor shook the ground beneath them. The crack in the earth widened, glowing with blue energy that pulsed like a heartbeat.\n\"We need to hurry,\" Arin said, her pendant still glowing faintly. \"The Division is weakening faster than expected.\"\nThey rushed to Tharros's vehicle, a sleek underwater craft that had been modified for surface travel. As they sped along the coastline, Sophia stared at Kael with new eyes.\n\"Royal blood,\" she murmured. \"That explains so much about you.\"\nKael's jaw tightened. \"I never knew. My parents never told me.\"\n\"They were protecting you,\" Tharros said, his hands gripping the controls. \"The royal families were hunted after the Division. Most were killed.\"\n\"But why?\" Sophia asked.\n\"Because they had the power to undo what they had done,\" Arin explained. \"To reverse the Division if they chose to.\"\nThe sky darkened further as they followed the coastline north. Strange lights danced across the horizon, shimmering like the northern lights but in shades of blue and gold that seemed wrong somehow.\nTharros pointed ahead to where the shoreline curved around a massive cliff face. \"There. That's where the temple should be.\"\nThey abandoned the vehicle on a narrow strip of beach. The tide was already pulling back, revealing wet sand dotted with tide pools that glowed with unnatural light.\n\"I can feel it,\" Arin whispered, her hand on her pendant. \"Ancient magic, waiting to be awakened.\"\nThey followed Kael along the base of the cliffs, the receding water exposing rock formations that had been underwater for centuries. Strange symbols were carved into the stone, growing more frequent as they continued.\n\"Here,\" Kael said suddenly, stopping before what appeared to be a solid wall of rock. \"It should be right here.\"\nSophia placed her hand on the cold stone. \"Are you sure? I don't see any entrance.\"\n\"The tablet said it would only reveal itself during the lowest tide,\" Kael reminded her. \"We might need to wait a bit longer.\"\nThe water continued to pull back, faster than any natural tide. As it receded, the cliff face began to change. What had seemed like natural cracks in the rock slowly formed a pattern-the outline of a massive doorway.\n\"It's working,\" Arin breathed.\nThe last of the water pulled away, and the outline of the door glowed blue. Kael stepped forward, pressing his palm against the center of the door.\n\"Blood of the seven,\" he said, his voice steady despite the fear in his eyes.\nAt his touch, the stone door began to sink into the ground, revealing a dark passage that sloped downward. Cool air rushed out, carrying the scent of salt and something older, like ancient books.\n\"What if it closes behind us?\" Sophia asked, eyeing the doorway nervously.\n\"Then we find another way out,\" Tharros said grimly. \"We don't have a choice.\"\nThey entered single file, Arin creating a small ball of green light to guide their way. The passage was narrow at first, then widened into a vast chamber that took their breath away.\nThe ceiling soared high above them, covered in glittering crystals that reflected Arin's light in dazzling patterns. The walls were carved with scenes depicting humans and mer people working side by side, building cities both above and below the water.\n\"This is from before the Division,\" Tharros said in awe. \"When all peoples lived together in harmony.\"\nAt the center of the chamber stood a massive statue-a human and a mer warrior standing back to back, their hands raised together holding a sphere.\n\"The coral throne,\" Kael whispered, approaching the statue. \"It's not actually a throne. It's this statue.\"\nThe sphere in the statue's hands glowed with inner light, pulsing in time with the strange lights they had seen in the sky.\n\"That must be the keystone,\" Sophia said, moving closer.\nAs she approached, the scales along her neck began to tingle and shift. The dormant magic within her stirred, responding to the keystone's power.\n\"Be careful,\" Tharros warned. \"The trials-\"\nBefore he could finish, the ground shook violently. Water began to seep into the chamber from unseen cracks in the walls.\n\"The tide is turning!\" Arin shouted. \"We're running out of time!\"\nKael moved toward the statue, but an invisible barrier stopped him. \"I can't reach it,\" he said, pushing against nothing. \"Something's blocking me.\"\nSophia tried next, but encountered the same barrier. \"I thought your royal blood was supposed to grant access.\"\n\"It should,\" Kael said, frustration evident in his voice. He pressed the crystal tablet against the barrier, but nothing happened.\nArin studied the statue more carefully. \"Look at the carvings at the base. They tell a story.\"\nThey gathered around, watching as the carvings began to glow and shift, showing scenes of cooperation between surface dwellers and underwater peoples-building together, celebrating together, defending each other.\n\"It's not just about royal blood,\" Arin realized. \"It's about unity. The human and mer working together.\"\nTharros looked at Sophia, understanding dawning in his eyes. \"You and Kael. You must approach it together.\"\nThe water was now ankle-deep and rising quickly. Outside, they could hear the crashing of waves as the ocean reclaimed the shore.\nSophia reached for Kael's hand. \"Ready?\"\nHe nodded, and together they stepped toward the statue. This time, the barrier let them pass.\n\"Now what?\" Sophia asked as they stood before the statue.\n\"Take the keystone,\" Kael said. \"I think... I think it's meant for you.\"\nSophia reached up, her fingers brushing the glowing sphere between the statue's upraised hands. The moment she touched it, energy surged through her body.\nShe gasped as the scales beneath her skin fully emerged, spreading across her neck and cheeks in beautiful iridescent patterns. Her eyes shifted, her vision suddenly sharper, clearer. The water rising around her ankles no longer felt cold, but welcoming, an extension of herself.\nWith a gentle tug, the keystone came free. The moment it did, the statue began to sink into the floor, revealing a hidden passage behind it.\n\"Quickly!\" Tharros shouted as water poured in faster now.\nThey splashed through the rising water toward the new passage. As they entered, Sophia felt a strange pull from the keystone. It wanted to go deeper, to show them something more.\n\"Wait,\" she said, stopping. \"I think we need to go this way.\"\nShe held the keystone out, and it glowed brighter, illuminating a narrow side passage they hadn't noticed.\n\"Are you sure?\" Arin asked, eyeing the rapidly rising water.\n\"Trust me,\" Sophia said with a confidence she didn't entirely feel.\nThey followed the new passage, climbing upward as the water chased at their heels. The tunnel twisted and turned, sometimes so narrow they had to squeeze through sideways.\nFinally, they emerged into another chamber, smaller than the first but no less impressive. At its center stood a pool of silver liquid, similar to what Kael had described from his vision.\nThe keystone in Sophia's hand pulled toward the pool, growing warmer.\n\"What now?\" Tharros asked, looking back at the passage where water continued to rise.\nSophia stepped toward the pool, the keystone guiding her movements. \"I think I'm supposed to-\"\nSuddenly, the chamber shook violently. Cracks appeared in the ceiling, and chunks of stone crashed into the pool, sending silver liquid splashing in all directions.\n\"It's collapsing!\" Arin cried.\nA massive section of the ceiling gave way, blocking the passage they had used to enter. Water sprayed through new cracks in the walls, quickly filling the chamber.\nSophia clutched the keystone tightly, feeling its power thrumming through her veins. With her new connection to water, she could sense a way out-a passage hidden behind the pool, leading upward.\n\"This way!\" she shouted over the roar of rushing water.\nAs they moved toward the hidden passage, a dark shape materialized in the doorway-a figure wrapped in shadows, its eyes glowing with malevolent purpose.\n\"At last,\" the figure said in a voice that chilled their bones. \"The keystones begin to gather.\"\nSophia stepped back in shock. The figure looked exactly like her, but with scales covering every inch of visible skin and eyes that held the darkness of the deepest ocean trenches.\n\"Who are you?\" she demanded.\nThe figure smiled, revealing sharp teeth. \"I am what you will become when the Division ends. And I've come to make sure you make the right choice.\"\nThe chamber continued to collapse around them as they faced this new threat, the keystone burning in Sophia's hand like a star about to explode.\nRoyal Challenges\n\"Stay away from her!\" Tharros roared, stepping in front of Sophia as water continued to pour into the chamber.\nThe shadowy figure that looked like Sophia laughed, the sound echoing oddly through the collapsing temple. \"You cannot stop what's already begun.\"\nKael drew his weapon, a shimmering blade that glowed with blue light. \"What do you want?\"\n\"The same thing you seek,\" the shadow-Sophia said, pointing at the keystone clutched in Sophia's hand. \"But unlike you, I understand its true purpose.\"\nThe temple shuddered again. A massive crack split the ceiling, sending more debris crashing down between them and the figure. When the dust cleared, the shadow was gone.\n\"We need to move,\" Arin urged, pulling at Tharros's arm. \"This whole place is coming down!\"\nSophia still clutched the keystone, its light pulsing stronger now. \"This way,\" she said, pointing to a narrow passage revealed behind the silver pool. \"I can feel something calling from there.\"\nThey squeezed through the opening just as another section of ceiling collapsed. The passage sloped upward, away from the rising water. After several twists and turns, they emerged into a vast cavern that took their breath away.\nThe walls glittered with embedded crystals that caught the light from the keystone, filling the space with dancing colors. At the center of the cavern stood three massive stone archways arranged in a triangle. In the middle of the triangle, a small pedestal rose from the floor.\n\"Look,\" Sophia whispered, pointing to symbols carved into the pedestal. They matched the markings on the crystal tablet Kael carried.\nKael approached cautiously, studying the ancient writing. \"It says these are the Trials of Heritage. Only one with royal blood can pass through and claim what lies beyond.\"\nTharros frowned. \"More tests? We don't have time for this.\"\n\"We don't have a choice,\" Kael replied. He traced his fingers over the symbols. \"Three trials: strength, wisdom, and blood. If I complete them, we get the second keystone.\"\nSophia stepped closer, still holding the first keystone. \"But we already have one. Why do we need another?\"\n\"Because one isn't enough,\" Arin said grimly. \"The tablet speaks of seven keystones-one for each of the royal families who created the Division. We need them all to seal the cracks between worlds.\"\n\"Or to break them completely,\" Tharros added quietly.\nAnother tremor shook the cavern, smaller than before but a reminder that time was running out.\n\"I have to try,\" Kael said, determination hardening his silver eyes. He turned to his friends. \"Wait here. This is something I must do alone.\"\nSophia grabbed his hand. \"Be careful.\"\nHis fingers squeezed hers briefly before he stepped toward the first archway. As soon as he crossed the threshold, the stone glowed bright blue, and the opening sealed behind him.\n\"Kael!\" Sophia cried out, rushing forward only to be stopped by Tharros.\n\"Trust him,\" the dragon king said. \"This is his destiny.\"\nInside the first archway, Kael found himself in a circular arena. Stone statues of warriors lined the walls, each holding different weapons. At first, they seemed like ordinary decorations-until they stepped from their pedestals.\nKael's heart pounded as the statues surrounded him, their stone eyes glowing with magic. \"The test of strength,\" he muttered, raising his blade.\nThe first statue lunged, swinging a massive stone sword. Kael ducked and rolled, feeling the air whoosh as the blade passed over his head. He slashed at the statue's legs, but his sword bounced off harmlessly.\nTwo more statues attacked from behind. Kael spun, blocking one strike but taking a painful blow to his shoulder from the other. He stumbled back, reassessing his strategy.\n\"I can't beat them with force alone,\" he realized. The royal blood in his veins seemed to warm at this thought, and suddenly he knew what to do.\nInstead of fighting against the statues, he began moving with them, redirecting their momentum. As one rushed him, he sidestepped and guided its stone arm into another statue. Both cracked from the impact.\nA strange energy built within him-his heritage awakening. With each movement, silver light trailed from his hands. When he next struck a statue, his blade cut through stone as if it were water.\nThe remaining statues attacked at once. Kael felt power surge through him, and he leapt impossibly high, spinning in midair. Silver energy exploded outward from his blade, shattering all the remaining guardians at once.\nAs the dust settled, a door appeared in the far wall. Breathing hard, Kael stepped through and found himself in a library filled with ancient scrolls. The second archway.\n\"Welcome to the Test of Wisdom,\" a voice whispered from the shadows. A ghostly figure materialized-an old man with kind eyes but no substance.\n\"To pass, you must answer three riddles,\" the ghost explained. \"Answer correctly, and you proceed. Answer wrongly...\" The ghost smiled sadly.\nKael nodded, ready to face this challenge.\n\"First riddle: I am always hungry, I must always be fed. The finger I touch will soon turn red. What am I?\"\nKael thought carefully. \"Fire,\" he answered.\nThe ghost nodded. \"Second riddle: I have cities, but no houses. I have mountains, but no trees. I have water, but no fish. What am I?\"\nThis was harder. Kael closed his eyes, seeking wisdom from his newly awakened royal blood. The answer came to him suddenly. \"A map.\"\n\"Correct,\" the ghost said, seeming pleased. \"Final riddle: What belongs to you, but others use it more than you do?\"\nKael frowned, considering various possibilities. What could others use more than its owner? The answer struck him with surprising clarity. \"My name.\"\nThe ghost clapped his transparent hands. \"Well done, prince of two worlds. The final test awaits.\"\nThe library faded, and Kael found himself in a small, bare chamber. In the center stood a simple basin filled with clear water. Above it floated a small crystal-similar to the keystone Sophia carried, but smaller and unfinished somehow.\n\"The Test of Heritage,\" Kael murmured.\nHe approached the basin cautiously. Words appeared on its surface: ONLY ROYAL BLOOD CAN AWAKEN THE SLEEPING STONE.\nKael understood. Drawing his dagger, he made a small cut across his palm. Blood welled up, bright red against his skin. He held his hand over the basin, letting three drops fall into the water.\nThe moment his blood touched the surface, the water turned silver. The floating crystal pulsed, growing brighter and more defined. Kael reached out, and the crystal moved into his palm as if drawn by a magnet.\nWarmth spread up his arm and throughout his body. Memories not his own flashed through his mind-the founding of Lumaria, the creation of the Division, the scattering of the royal families. With each memory, more of his heritage awakened. His silver eyes glowed brighter, and markings similar to those on Tharros appeared on his skin, shimmering with inner light.\nThe wall before him dissolved, revealing a passage back to his friends. As he stepped through, Sophia gasped.\n\"Kael! Your eyes-your skin!\"\nHe looked down at himself. The royal markings covered his arms now, pulsing with silver light that matched the crystal in his hand.\n\"You did it,\" Tharros said, impressed despite himself.\n\"Not just that,\" Kael replied, his voice stronger and more confident than before. \"I remembered. The Division wasn't just to separate worlds-it was to protect something. Something dangerous.\"\nArin's eyes widened. \"The Leviathan. The creature of pure corruption that threatened to destroy both realms.\"\n\"Yes,\" Kael nodded. \"And now it's waking up again. That shadow we saw-it's not Sophia's future. It's the Leviathan taking her form, trying to manipulate us.\"\nSophia clutched her keystone tighter. \"What does it want?\"\n\"It wants us to gather the keystones,\" Kael explained. \"But not to seal the Division-to shatter it completely. It believes with the barriers down, it can consume both worlds.\"\nAnother tremor, stronger than before, shook the cavern. A crack appeared in one wall, and seawater began to seep through.\n\"We need to leave,\" Tharros urged. \"Now.\"\nAs they hurried toward an exit tunnel, Sophia paused, staring at the two keystones they now possessed. \"Wait. If the Leviathan wants us to find the keystones, should we even be looking for them?\"\nKael met her gaze, his silver eyes reflecting determination. \"We don't have a choice. Without all seven, we can't repair the Division either. But now we know we can't just blindly follow the path set before us.\"\nAs they reached the tunnel entrance, a familiar dark shape materialized, blocking their escape. The shadow-Sophia smiled, its eyes now glowing with purple fire.\n\"Two down, five to go,\" it purred. \"You're doing so well. I'll be waiting for you at the Coral Throne.\" The figure dissolved into mist, leaving the path clear.\n\"What did it mean?\" Sophia asked, her voice trembling slightly.\nKael looked at the crystal in his hand, its light pulsing in sync with the keystone Sophia carried.\n\"It means,\" he said grimly, \"that finding the remaining keystones isn't going to be as simple as passing a few tests. The real trial is figuring out what to do with them when we have them all.\"\nThe cavern rumbled again, and the crack in the wall widened. This time, it wasn't just water seeping through-something large and dark moved behind the opening, something with glowing eyes and ancient hunger.\n\"Run!\" Tharros shouted, as the wall began to crumble behind them.\nThe Scholar's Map\n\"Run!\" Tharros shouted as the wall crumbled behind them.\nThey sprinted through the tunnel, the sound of rushing water and something large chasing them echoing off the stone walls. The two keystones pulsed brighter as they ran, lighting their way forward.\n\"There!\" Arin pointed to a narrow crack in the wall ahead. \"I feel fresh air coming from there.\"\nThey squeezed through just as massive claws scraped the stone behind them. Outside, they found themselves on a rocky shelf overlooking the ocean. The temple had been built into a cliff face, now partly collapsed into the sea below.\nSophia clutched her keystone, breathing hard. \"That was too close.\"\nKael nodded, his new royal markings still glowing on his skin. \"We need to get somewhere safe to figure out our next move.\"\n\"I know someone who might help,\" Arin said quietly. When everyone turned to her, she looked uncomfortable. \"An old scholar I met years ago. He studies energy patterns in the ocean-patterns like these keystones create.\"\nTharros frowned. \"You never mentioned this before.\"\n\"I didn't think it mattered until now.\" Arin's eyes flashed. \"He lives in seclusion for a reason. Many have tried to use his knowledge for power.\"\n\"Can we trust him?\" Sophia asked.\n\"More than we can trust anyone else right now,\" Arin replied.\nThey made their way down the cliff to where their underwater transport was hidden. As they sped through the deep currents, Sophia studied her keystone, watching how it seemed to pulse in rhythm with Kael's.\n\"They're like heartbeats,\" she whispered. \"Like they're alive somehow.\"\nArin guided them to a remote part of the ocean where massive underwater caves dotted the seafloor. One cave entrance was ringed with strange, glowing symbols that changed color as they approached.\n\"He knows we're coming,\" Arin said.\nInside, the cave opened into a vast library. Shelves carved from living coral held thousands of scrolls, tablets, and oddly shaped objects. Maps covered the walls-not ordinary maps, but swirling patterns of light that moved and shifted like the currents outside.\nAn old mer-man with a long white beard and bright, curious eyes swam out from behind a shelf. His tail was faded blue, and patches of scales were missing, showing his great age.\n\"Arin Blacktide,\" he said, his voice surprisingly strong. \"It's been decades. And you've brought friends-and two keystones!\" His eyes widened at the sight of the glowing crystals.\n\"Scholar Nereus,\" Arin bowed slightly. \"We need your help.\"\nNereus circled them, his eyes fixed on the keystones. When he spotted the royal markings on Kael's skin, he gasped.\n\"A royal descendant! I thought all the bloodlines were lost after the Division.\" He squinted at Kael. \"Which family are you from, boy?\"\n\"I don't know,\" Kael admitted. \"I only just discovered my heritage.\"\nNereus nodded thoughtfully, then turned to Sophia. \"And you-you're not from our world at all, are you? Yet that keystone chose you.\"\nSophia met his gaze steadily. \"I'm trying to understand what that means.\"\n\"It means the old prophecies aren't as straightforward as we thought.\" Nereus swam to a particular shelf and pulled down a crystal sphere. When he set it on a pedestal, it projected a map onto the cave ceiling-a map of glowing lines crisscrossing the ocean.\n\"I've spent my life tracking energy patterns,\" he explained. \"The keystones create ripples in the magic that flows through our waters. When the Division was created, those ripples were balanced perfectly. But now-\" he gestured at the map, where dark patches disrupted the glowing lines, \"-now that balance is breaking down.\"\nTharros growled. \"We know that already. What we need is to find the other keystones before the Leviathan does.\"\nNereus raised an eyebrow. \"The Leviathan? So it's awakened again.\" He sighed heavily. \"I feared this day would come.\"\nHe swam to another shelf and returned with a small, ancient tablet. \"Your keystones should react to this.\"\nWhen he placed the tablet near their crystals, both keystones flashed brightly. The tablet's surface changed, revealing a map with seven points of light. Two pulsed strongly-their keystones. A third glowed steadily.\n\"There,\" Nereus pointed. \"The third keystone. It's hidden beneath a lighthouse on the northern shore. A lighthouse that has never failed, even in the worst storms.\"\n\"The Everglow Lighthouse,\" Arin whispered. \"I know it.\"\nSophia leaned forward. \"What about the others?\"\n\"They remain hidden until you possess the one before it,\" Nereus explained. \"A safeguard, I suspect.\"\nKael studied the map carefully. \"So we just need to collect them all and use them to reinforce the Division, right?\"\nNereus frowned. \"It's not that simple. The keystones were created with dual purpose-they can strengthen the Division or destroy it completely. The intention of those who gather them shapes their power.\"\nSophia remembered the shadow-Sophia's words. \"And the Leviathan wants us to gather them so it can use them to break the Division.\"\n\"Precisely.\" Nereus touched the tablet again, and the image changed to show two worlds colliding. \"If all seven keystones are brought together with destruction in mind, both realms will collide. The Leviathan feeds on chaos-such a collision would give it unlimited power.\"\n\"Then we shouldn't find them at all,\" Tharros argued.\n\"That's not an option,\" Nereus shook his head sadly. \"The Division is already failing. Without the keystones, both worlds will eventually collapse anyway. Your only hope is to find them first and use them with pure intentions.\"\nSophia felt a chill run through her. \"How do we know our intentions are pure enough? The Leviathan is manipulating us already.\"\nNereus swam closer to her, his old eyes kind but serious. \"That's the real test, isn't it? Not finding the keystones, but knowing your own heart.\"\nA sudden tremor shook the cave, sending scrolls tumbling from shelves. Outside, the water darkened.\n\"It's found us,\" Kael said, his hand going to his weapon.\nNereus quickly pressed the tablet into Sophia's hands. \"Take this. It will guide you to the lighthouse.\"\n\"Come with us,\" Sophia urged.",

        "content": "Nereus shook his head. \"My journey ends here. I've prepared for this day.\" He swam to the center of his library and raised his hands. The maps on the walls brightened. \"Go! I'll hold it back as long as I can.\"\nAs they swam toward the exit, Sophia looked back. Nereus stood surrounded by swirling light from his maps, his face peaceful despite the darkness seeping into his cave.\nOutside, they could see an enormous shadow moving through the water toward them. Its purple eyes gleamed with hunger.\n\"This way!\" Arin called, leading them up through a narrow crevice.\nThey shot through the water, the tablet and keystones lighting their path. Behind them, a massive explosion of light erupted from Nereus's cave, temporarily pushing back the darkness.\nWhen they finally stopped, miles away and closer to the surface, Sophia clutched the tablet with shaking hands.\n\"He sacrificed himself for us,\" she whispered.\nTharros's face was grim. \"He won't be the last.\"\nKael examined the tablet. \"The Everglow Lighthouse is three days' journey from here.\"\n\"And the Leviathan will be right behind us,\" Arin added quietly.\nSophia looked at each of her companions-Tharros with his fierce protective stance, Kael with his newly discovered royal heritage glowing on his skin, and Arin with her worried eyes but determined expression. They had already lost so much, and their journey was just beginning.\n\"Then we'd better hurry,\" Sophia said, her voice stronger now. She held up the tablet, which gleamed with the location of the third keystone. \"The lighthouse is waiting.\"\nAs if responding to her words, both keystones flashed brightly, illuminating something in the water ahead-a strange current flowing against the natural tide, heading directly toward the northern shore.\n\"What is that?\" Tharros asked, eyes narrowed.\nArin's face paled. \"A current that flows backward? That's impossible unless...\"\n\"Unless what?\" Kael demanded.\n\"Unless something powerful is already at the lighthouse,\" Arin whispered. \"Something that's calling to the keystones.\"\nThe tablet in Sophia's hands suddenly grew hot, and a new mark appeared on the map-a symbol none of them recognized.\n\"I don't think we're the only ones looking for the keystones anymore,\" Sophia said quietly, as the dark water behind them seemed to pulse with malevolent purpose.\nConvergence Point\nThree days of hard swimming had left them exhausted. The Everglow Lighthouse had been both a blessing and a disaster. They'd found the third keystone hidden in its ancient foundation, but the battle that followed had forced them to split up.\nNow, a week later, Sophia stood alone on the shore of a tiny, unmarked island, clutching her keystone to her chest. The wind whipped her hair as she scanned the horizon. According to their emergency plan, this was where they would meet if separated. The island appeared on no maps, hidden by ancient magic that bent light around it, making it invisible to passing ships and aircraft.\n\"Where are you?\" she whispered, the fear in her stomach growing heavier with each passing hour.\nA splash from the water made her spin around. Relief flooded through her as Arin emerged from the waves, her silver-blue hair plastered to her face.\n\"Sophia!\" Arin rushed forward, embracing her. \"You made it!\"\n\"Barely,\" Sophia admitted, holding up her keystone. \"This thing pulled me through a storm I thought would drown me.\"\nArin nodded grimly. \"The keystones protect their carriers. But the protection comes at a cost.\"\nShe held up her hand, revealing angry red marks where her own keystone-the one they'd found beneath the lighthouse-had burned patterns into her palm.\n\"Did you see any sign of the others?\" Sophia asked, her voice tight with worry.\nArin shook her head. \"Nothing. But Tharros is strong, and Kael-\"\n\"Is right here,\" came a familiar voice from behind them.\nThey turned to see Kael emerging from the tree line, his clothes torn and his face scratched, but very much alive. The royal markings on his skin pulsed with silver light as he approached.\nSophia ran to him, throwing her arms around his neck. \"I thought we'd lost you!\"\nKael held her tight, his heart racing against hers. \"Never. I promised, remember?\"\nAs they separated, Sophia noticed he was carrying something wrapped in seaweed-a fourth keystone, glowing with golden light.\n\"You found another one?\" Arin asked in amazement.\nKael nodded. \"After we were separated, my keystone pulled me east. I followed it to an underwater graveyard-old ships from a forgotten war. The keystone was hidden in the captain's quarters of the largest wreck, guarded by spirits that...\" He hesitated. \"Let's just say they weren't friendly.\"\n\"That makes four,\" Sophia said, counting. \"Mine, yours, Arin's, and the new one.\"\nA shadow fell over them. They looked up to see Tharros descending from the sky in his dragon form, his scales gleaming in the sunlight. He landed with a thud that shook the beach, then transformed into his human shape.\n\"You're late,\" Kael said with a small smile.\nTharros glared at him, but there was relief in his eyes. \"I had to take a detour.\" He reached into a pouch at his waist and pulled out a scroll bound with coral string. \"The Shark Clans are mobilizing. They know what we're doing.\"\n\"Did they follow you?\" Arin asked, instantly alert.\n\"No. But others might have.\" Tharros looked at each of them in turn. \"The Leviathan's agents are everywhere now. Shadow creatures that can take any form.\"\nSophia shivered, remembering the shadow version of herself they'd encountered. \"We need to work quickly, then.\"\nThey gathered in the center of the beach, forming a circle. Each placed their keystone in front of them on the sand-Sophia's silver one, Kael's blue crystal, Arin's green stone from the lighthouse, and the golden one Kael had recovered from the shipwreck.\n\"What now?\" Tharros asked. \"Do we just... bring them together?\"\n\"The tablet said nothing about this part,\" Sophia admitted, looking at the scholar's map they'd received. \"It only showed us where to find them.\"\nKael studied the keystones thoughtfully. \"The royal markings on my skin react to my keystone. Maybe...\" He reached out, touching his crystal. The markings on his arm flared brightly.\n\"Try touching them all,\" Arin suggested.\nKael nodded and placed his hands on all four keystones at once. Immediately, the royal markings spread from his arms across his face and chest, glowing with intense light. The keystones responded, each pulsing in rhythm with his heartbeat.\n\"They're connecting,\" Sophia whispered in awe.\nThe four keystones rose into the air, hovering a few feet above the sand. Slowly, they began to orbit around each other, moving faster and faster until they formed a circle of light. From this circle, a beam shot upward into the sky, then spread outward like an umbrella of light.\nWithin this dome of light, a three-dimensional map appeared-oceans, continents, and depths all rendered in glowing detail.\n\"It's a map of both worlds,\" Arin said, her eyes wide. \"The surface and what lies beneath.\"\nThe map zoomed in on a particular section of ocean, revealing a massive trench that none of them recognized. At the bottom of this trench, a city glimmered-spires and domes and streets, all preserved as if frozen in time.\n\"Lumaria,\" Kael breathed, his voice filled with wonder. \"The ancient capital, lost after the Division.\"\nThe map shifted again, highlighting three points of light scattered across the ocean.\n\"The final three keystones,\" Tharros said, leaning closer.\nThe first point appeared in a familiar location-the royal palace of Aquaria. The second shimmered deep within what appeared to be a volcanic vent, glowing with heat and danger.\nThe third, however, appeared in the strangest location of all-it existed as a pulsing light that flickered between their underwater world and the surface world, never fully in either.\n\"A keystone between worlds,\" Sophia murmured. \"How is that possible?\"\nAs they watched, the map zoomed out again, showing a timeline. Dark tendrils began spreading from the deepest trenches, consuming the light of both worlds. Then, a point of convergence appeared-a place where all seven keystones could be brought together.\n\"That's it,\" Arin said excitedly. \"The point of convergence where we can repair the Division!\"\nBut even as she spoke, the map changed again. The same convergence point glowed red, and instead of repairing the Division, it showed both worlds colliding, shattering into fragments as the Leviathan grew to enormous size, feeding on the chaos.\n\"Two possible futures,\" Kael said grimly. \"Depending on our intentions.\"\nThe map faded, and the keystones drifted back down to the sand, their light dimming. As they touched the ground, a tremor ran through the island.\n\"What was that?\" Sophia asked, steadying herself against Kael.\nAnother tremor, stronger this time. The sand beneath their feet began to shift and sink.\n\"We need to move!\" Tharros shouted, grabbing two of the keystones. \"Now!\"\nAs they scrambled to collect the remaining keystones, the center of the beach collapsed, revealing a massive sinkhole. From within the darkness, purple eyes gleamed-dozens of them, blinking up at the group.\n\"It found us,\" Arin gasped, clutching her keystone tightly.\nTentacles of shadow shot from the pit, grasping for them. Kael slashed at one with his blade, which now glowed with the same light as his royal markings.\n\"Split up again!\" he yelled over the roar that emerged from the pit. \"We know where the other keystones are now. Meet at Lumaria!\"\n\"But no one knows how to find Lumaria!\" Sophia protested, dodging a shadow that tried to wrap around her ankle.\n\"The keystones will guide us,\" Tharros said, transforming partway to give his arms scale armor as he fought back the shadows. \"They've shown us this much.\"\nArin raised her hands, creating a blinding flash of light that temporarily drove back the shadows. \"Sophia, go with Kael to the palace. Tharros and I will find the one in the volcanic vent.\"\n\"And the keystone between worlds?\" Sophia asked, even as Kael pulled her toward the edge of the island.\n\"We'll figure that out when we have the others,\" Tharros growled. \"Now go!\"\nAs they separated, racing away from the collapsing island, Sophia looked back one last time. The entire island was sinking now, dragged down by whatever creature had been hiding beneath it all along.\n\"You think it was waiting for us?\" she asked Kael as they dove into the ocean.\n\"I think it wanted us to find the map,\" he replied grimly. \"It's using us to locate the keystones.\"\nSophia clutched her keystone tighter, feeling its warmth against her skin. \"Then we're doing exactly what it wants.\"\nKael's eyes met hers, determination burning in their silver depths. \"Only until we find a way to change the game.\"\nTogether they swam deeper, leaving the sinking island behind. Ahead lay Aquaria's royal palace, the fifth keystone, and a growing sense that time was running out. Behind them, the water darkened with shadows that seemed to whisper with the voice of the Leviathan.\n\"Come, little keys,\" it seemed to say. \"Show me the way home.\"\nThe Key Between Worlds\nSophia and Kael swam through the dark waters, following the pull of their keystones. Behind them, the unmarked island sank deeper, swallowed by shadows and hungry purple eyes.\n\"Do you think Arin and Tharros made it out?\" Sophia asked, her voice tight with worry.\nKael squeezed her hand. \"They're strong. Arin's magic and Tharros's dragon form... they'll be fine.\"\nBut his eyes held doubt that matched her own. The shadow creature beneath the island had been massive-perhaps even a piece of the Leviathan itself.\nAfter hours of swimming, they reached the glittering outer reefs that protected Aquaria's royal palace. Guards with spears made of crystal patrolled the borders, their faces alert and suspicious.\n\"Halt!\" The lead guard raised his weapon when he spotted them. Then his eyes widened. \"Prince Kael! You've returned!\"\nKael nodded. \"We need to see the Queen immediately.\"\n\"The palace is on lockdown,\" the guard said, swimming closer. \"Shadow creatures have been spotted in the outer districts. The Queen ordered-\"\n\"Tell her we have four keystones,\" Sophia interrupted, holding hers up. The silver stone pulsed with light.\nThe guard's eyes grew even wider. \"Follow me.\"\nThey swam through hidden passages beneath the coral, avoiding the main thoroughfares where ordinary citizens might see them. The palace shimmered ahead, its spires reaching toward the surface world.\n\"The fifth keystone is here somewhere,\" Sophia whispered, feeling the pull growing stronger.\nInside the palace, they found Queen Maris waiting in the war room, surrounded by maps and anxious advisors.\n\"My son,\" she said, embracing Kael. Her eyes, the same silver as his, turned to Sophia. \"And the human who is not just human.\"\nSophia bowed her head. \"Your Majesty.\"\n\"You've brought the keystones,\" the Queen said, eyeing the glowing objects they carried.\n\"Four of them,\" Kael confirmed. \"And we believe the fifth is here, in the palace.\"\nThe Queen's face grew serious. \"The ancient texts speak of a royal keystone, passed down through generations of rulers. I always thought it was just a symbol of power, not a real object with magic.\"\nShe led them to a small room behind the throne. Inside stood a pedestal carved from coral and pearl. Atop it rested a crown-simple yet beautiful, made of silver and adorned with tiny crystals.\n\"The Crown of the First Queen,\" Maris explained. \"No ruler has worn it since the Division.\"\nAs they approached, their keystones began to pulse faster, glowing brighter.\n\"It's here,\" Sophia breathed. \"The keystone is part of the crown.\"\nKael reached out hesitantly. \"Mother, may I?\"\nQueen Maris nodded, her expression torn between duty and fear.\nAs Kael's fingers touched the crown, the central crystal detached itself, hovering in the air. The royal markings on his skin flared with silver light that matched the glow of the crystal.\n\"The fifth keystone,\" he said in awe, as it settled into his palm.\nSuddenly, the palace shook. Guards rushed in, their faces panicked.\n\"Your Majesty! Shadow creatures have breached the outer defenses!\"\nMaris turned to Sophia and Kael. \"You must go. If the Leviathan's forces get the keystones-\"\n\"We can't leave you!\" Kael protested.\n\"I am Queen,\" Maris said firmly. \"My place is with my people. Yours is to finish this mission.\" She touched his face gently. \"I always knew the markings chose you for a reason.\"\nAnother tremor rocked the palace. Through the windows, Sophia could see dark shapes moving through the water, extinguishing the bioluminescent lights as they passed.\n\"We need to find Arin and Tharros,\" Sophia said, clutching Kael's arm. \"And the sixth keystone.\"\n\"The volcanic vent,\" Kael nodded. \"But what about the seventh? The one between worlds?\"\nQueen Maris's eyes widened. \"Between worlds? The legends speak of such a keystone-neither of the depths nor of the surface, but existing in the boundary between.\"\n\"How do we find something that isn't fully in either world?\" Sophia asked.\nBefore the Queen could answer, the palace shook again, harder this time. The walls cracked, and water rushed in from a new direction.\n\"Go now!\" Maris ordered, pushing them toward a hidden passage. \"Take the royal tunnels-they'll lead you safely out of the city.\"\nKael embraced his mother one last time. \"We'll come back.\"\n\"I know,\" she whispered.\nThey swam through the narrow tunnel, the five keystones now secured in a special pouch Maris had given them. Behind them, they heard shouts and the clash of weapons.\nAs they emerged from the tunnel into open water, Sophia gasped. The beautiful city of Aquaria was under attack. Shadow creatures slithered between buildings, their purple eyes gleaming. Citizens fled in panic while guards fought bravely.\n\"We have to help them,\" Sophia said, starting to turn back.\nKael caught her arm. \"We can't. Not now. The best way to help is to find the remaining keystones.\"\nTears mixed with the salt water around Sophia's face. \"I hate this. Running while others fight.\"\n\"Sometimes the bravest thing is to keep going,\" Kael said, his voice breaking.\nThey swam away from the city, following the pull of the keystones. The volcanic vent lay to the south, near the boundary of the Shark Clans' territory.\n\"Do you think Arin and Tharros made it there?\" Sophia asked.\n\"I hope so,\" Kael replied. \"But I'm worried about-\"\nHis words cut off as a shadow passed over them. They looked up to see a massive shape blocking the light from above.\n\"Tharros?\" Sophia called hopefully.\nBut the shape that descended was not their dragon friend. It was larger, darker, with glowing purple eyes that matched the creatures attacking Aquaria.\n\"Shadow dragon,\" Kael whispered in horror.\nThe creature opened its mouth, revealing rows of teeth that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it.\n\"Little keys,\" it hissed in a voice that sounded like bubbles rising through mud. \"The master seeks what you carry.\"\nKael pushed Sophia behind him, drawing his blade. \"Run. I'll hold it off.\"\n\"I'm not leaving you,\" Sophia insisted, readying her own powers.\nThe shadow dragon circled them, its tail creating currents that pulled them closer.\n\"The seventh keystone,\" it said, its voice slipping directly into their minds. \"The one between worlds. Do you not see it yet?\"\nSophia frowned. \"What are you talking about?\"\nThe dragon's laugh sent chills through the water. \"The Leviathan knows what you do not. Why do you think you were drawn to this quest, surface-dweller?\"\nA terrible thought formed in Sophia's mind. She looked down at her hands, at the faint shimmer of scales that had appeared on her skin since she first entered this underwater world.\n\"No,\" she whispered.\nThe shadow dragon dove toward them, jaws open wide.\nKael slashed with his blade, cutting through shadow that reformed instantly. Sophia summoned her power, creating a blast of superheated water that pushed the creature back momentarily.\n\"We can't beat it,\" Kael shouted. \"We need to run!\"\nThey swam down, using the darkness of the depths to hide. The shadow dragon roared in frustration, its voice shaking the water around them.\n\"You cannot escape what you are,\" it called after them. \"The seventh keystone has always been with you, Sophia. You are the key between worlds!\"\nAs they fled deeper into the dark waters, Sophia's mind raced with the creature's words. Could it be true? Was she somehow the final keystone?\nAnd if she was, what did that mean for the future of both worlds-and for her own destiny?\nIn the distance, the volcanic vent glowed with fiery light, offering a beacon of hope. But Sophia couldn't shake the feeling that they were swimming straight into the Leviathan's trap.\n\"Kael,\" she said, her voice barely audible, \"what if I'm the seventh keystone?\"\nHis eyes met hers, fear and determination mixing in their silver depths.\n\"Then,\" he said, \"we've just become the most dangerous people in both worlds.\"\nBehind them, the shadow of the dragon grew larger, and ahead, the volcanic vent pulsed with ominous power.\nThe Sunken Throne\nThe volcanic vent loomed before them, angry red light pulsing from deep within the earth. Sophia and Kael hovered at its edge, their faces illuminated by the eerie glow.\n\"Do you think they made it?\" Sophia asked, scanning the area for any sign of their friends.\nKael pointed to a series of marks carved into a nearby rock. \"Tharros's claw marks. They were here.\"\nRelief washed over Sophia, but it was short-lived. The shadow dragon's words still echoed in her mind: You are the key between worlds.\n\"We need to find them,\" she said, pushing the troubling thought aside. \"The map showed the sixth keystone is inside the vent, but-\"\nA familiar roar cut through the water. They turned to see Tharros speeding toward them, his dragon form sleek and powerful. Behind him, Arin's blue-silver hair streamed like a banner.\n\"You're alive!\" Sophia cried as they approached.\nTharros transformed into his human shape, his eyes wild with excitement. \"We found it! The sixth keystone!\"\nArin held up a ruby-red crystal that pulsed with the same rhythm as their other keystones. \"It was guarded by fire spirits in the heart of the vent,\" she explained, her arms showing fresh burns that were slowly healing beneath her magic.\n\"We have the fifth one,\" Kael said, showing them the royal crystal from the palace crown. His face darkened. \"But Aquaria is under attack. Shadow creatures everywhere.\"\nTharros nodded grimly. \"They're following the keystones. Tracking our movements.\"\n\"The map showed the final location,\" Arin reminded them. \"Lumaria. The lost capital.\"\n\"The trench,\" Sophia said, remembering the deep, dark line on the map. \"But how do we find a city that's been hidden for centuries?\"\nKael held up his keystone. The royal markings on his skin pulsed in sync with it. \"I think... I think I can feel it. Like it's calling to me.\"\nTharros looked at him curiously. \"The royal markings. They're stronger now.\"",

        "content": "\"There's something else,\" Sophia said hesitantly. She told them about the shadow dragon's claim-that she herself might be the seventh keystone.\nArin's eyes widened. \"The keystone between worlds... it makes sense. You're the only one of us who belongs to both realms.\"\n\"But what does it mean?\" Sophia asked, fear creeping into her voice.\n\"We'll figure it out,\" Kael promised, taking her hand. \"Right now, we need to find Lumaria before the Leviathan's forces catch up to us.\"\nTogether, they swam deeper, following Kael's instincts. The water grew colder and darker as they descended into the trench. Even Tharros, with his dragon eyes, struggled to see.\n\"This doesn't feel right,\" Arin muttered, creating a small ball of magical light. \"These trenches... they're old. Older than anything I've studied.\"\nThe walls of the trench were smooth, as if carved by giant hands rather than natural forces. Strange symbols flickered across the surface, appearing and disappearing like ghosts.\n\"It's an illusion spell,\" Arin whispered, reaching out to touch one of the symbols. \"Powerful magic.\"\nAs her fingers brushed the wall, the symbols flared to life. The trench wall shimmered and dissolved, revealing a hidden passage.\n\"By the ancient depths,\" Tharros breathed.\nThey swam through the opening into darkness. For a moment, they could see nothing. Then, one by one, lights began to appear-soft, blue-green glows that spread across what looked like a vast city square.\nBuildings rose around them, perfectly preserved despite centuries underwater. Spires reached upward, connected by delicate bridges. Gardens of crystal flowers sparkled in the growing light.\n\"Lumaria,\" Kael whispered, his voice filled with awe.\nIn the center of the square stood a massive structure unlike the others. Where most of the city was built from coral and crystal, this building was carved from dark stone that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it.\n\"The royal palace,\" Tharros said, swimming toward it. \"The heart of the old kingdom.\"\nAs they approached the palace doors, Kael suddenly doubled over, clutching his chest. The royal markings on his skin blazed with silver fire.\n\"Kael!\" Sophia cried, grabbing him before he could sink.\n\"It's... calling me,\" he gasped. \"Something inside. It knows I'm here.\"\nThe massive doors swung open silently, as if inviting them in.\n\"Should we?\" Arin asked, glancing nervously at the others.\n\"We don't have a choice,\" Tharros said. \"The seventh keystone is somewhere in there.\"\nThey swam inside, following a grand hallway lined with statues of ancient rulers. Each wore the same crown that had held the fifth keystone, their faces proud and distant.\nThe hallway opened into a vast chamber. At its center, on a raised platform, stood a throne carved from a single piece of blue-black stone. It seemed to pulse with its own light, casting long shadows across the floor.\nAnd on the throne sat a crystal, larger than any of their keystones, glowing with all the colors of the sea.\n\"The seventh keystone,\" Sophia breathed.\nBut Kael shook his head, his eyes fixed on the throne. \"No. That's the sixth. The final underwater keystone.\"\n\"But we already have six,\" Arin said, confused. \"The one from the volcano makes six.\"\n\"Count again,\" Tharros said quietly. \"Silver, blue, green, gold, royal crystal... five. The volcano keystone is the sixth.\"\n\"Then what about the one between worlds?\" Sophia asked, touching her own skin where scales had begun to form.\nBefore anyone could answer, the markings on Kael's skin flared again. He walked forward as if in a trance, approaching the throne step by step.\n\"Kael, wait!\" Sophia called, but he didn't seem to hear.\nAs he reached the throne, the crystal floated upward, hovering before him. The entire chamber began to glow, light spreading from the floor to the walls to the vaulted ceiling.\nAround them, ghostly figures appeared-men and women in royal garb, watching Kael with expectant eyes.\n\"The blood returns,\" whispered a voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.\nKael reached for the crystal. As his fingers touched it, the royal markings on his skin spread, covering his entire body in silver light. The ghostly figures bowed their heads.\n\"Returned King,\" they said in unison.\nKael turned to his friends, his eyes wide with shock. \"I don't understand. My mother is the Queen of Aquaria, but this place... these people...\"\nAn elderly ghost glided forward, his transparent crown matching the one that had held the fifth keystone.\n\"You carry the blood of two kingdoms, young prince,\" the ghost said. \"Your father was the last heir of Lumaria, hidden away when our city fell. The royal line lives in you.\"\n\"My father?\" Kael whispered. \"But he died before I was born. Mother never spoke of his family.\"\n\"To protect you,\" the ghost king said. \"The Leviathan hunted all with Lumarian blood. It fears what you might become.\"\nThe crystal pulsed in Kael's hand, responding to his emotions. Around them, the ghostly court watched in reverent silence.\n\"Why does it fear me?\" Kael asked, his voice stronger now.\n\"Because only one of dual bloodlines can unite the keystones properly. Only you can repair the Division without destroying both worlds.\"\nSophia moved to Kael's side, taking his free hand. \"Then Kael is the key to saving everything.\"\nThe ghost king smiled sadly. \"He is one key. But not alone.\" He turned his gaze to Sophia. \"The Leviathan spoke truth, child of two worlds. You are indeed the final keystone.\"\n\"How can a person be a keystone?\" Tharros demanded.\n\"Not her body,\" the ghost explained. \"Her essence. Her very soul bridges the gap between realms, just as the ancient spell requires. Without her, the keystones are just pretty rocks.\"\nSuddenly, the palace shook. Dust and small pieces of stone fell from the ceiling.\n\"They've found us,\" Arin said, her hands already glowing with defensive magic.\n\"Take the keystone and go,\" the ghost king urged. \"The guardian spell that hides Lumaria is failing. The shadows will be upon you soon.\"\nKael hesitated, looking at the ghostly court-his ancestors. \"I'll come back,\" he promised.\n\"Of course you will,\" the ghost king said with a proud smile. \"This is your kingdom, after all.\"\nAnother tremor rocked the palace, stronger this time. The ghostly figures began to fade.\n\"Remember,\" the ghost king's voice echoed as he disappeared, \"the keystones can create or destroy. The Convergence Point must be approached with pure intentions, or all is lost.\"\nAs the ghosts vanished completely, the grand doors of the throne room burst open. Shadow creatures poured in, their purple eyes fixed on the seven keystones now gathered in one place.\n\"Run!\" Tharros shouted, transforming into his dragon form.\nAs they fled through a side passage, Sophia looked back at Kael, seeing him in a new light-not just a warrior prince, but a king of a lost kingdom.\n\"Are you okay?\" she asked as they swam through the narrow corridor.\nKael clutched the sixth keystone tightly, his eyes determined. \"I will be. Once we finish this.\"\nBehind them, the shadows grew thicker, and ahead lay the Convergence Point-and the final battle for both worlds.\nAwakening Powers\nThe escape from Lumaria was chaos. Shadow creatures poured through the ancient city, their purple eyes glowing in the darkness. Tharros led the way in his dragon form, clearing a path with sweeps of his powerful tail.\n\"This way!\" Arin called, pointing to a narrow crack in the outer wall. \"I can sense clean water beyond!\"\nAs they squeezed through the opening, Sophia gasped. Her lungs burned suddenly, as if she'd forgotten how to breathe underwater. Panic flooded her mind as she clutched at her throat.\n\"Sophia!\" Kael grabbed her, his eyes wide with fear.\nBut just as quickly as it started, the pain vanished. Something shifted inside her body. Sophia took a deep breath-not through her temporary gills, but directly through her lungs.\n\"What's happening to me?\" she whispered, touching her sides where her gills had been.\n\"You're changing,\" Arin said, watching her closely. \"The keystones are accelerating your transformation.\"\nThey swam deeper into open water, putting distance between themselves and the shadow creatures. The seven keystones glowed brightly in the pouch at Kael's side.\nSophia felt strange. Energy coursed through her body like electricity. Her vision sharpened until she could see details in the darkness that should have been impossible. And the water... she could feel every current, every tiny movement around her.\nA school of fish darted past, their silver bodies flashing in the dim light.\nDanger behind! Flee! Flee!\nSophia spun around. \"Did you hear that?\"\n\"Hear what?\" Tharros asked, transforming back into his human form.\n\"The fish... they were talking.\" Sophia shook her head, feeling crazy. \"I heard their thoughts.\"\nArin's eyes widened. \"Try again. Focus on them.\"\nSophia turned toward the retreating school, reaching out with her mind. Hello? Can you hear me?\nThe fish changed direction immediately, circling back toward her. Their collective thoughts hit her like a wave.\nThe two-legs speaks! She is of the old ones! The guardians have returned!\n\"They can hear me,\" Sophia gasped. \"And they said something about guardians returning.\"\nArin grabbed Sophia's hand, her eyes intense. \"We need to talk. Now.\" She pulled Sophia away from the others, swimming to a small outcropping of rock.\n\"What's happening to me?\" Sophia asked, her voice trembling.\n\"I've suspected for some time,\" Arin said quietly. \"The way the water responds to you, how quickly you adapted to our world. You're not just any human, Sophia. Your ancestors were Guardians.\"\n\"Guardians? Of what?\"\n\"Of the balance. Before the Division, certain families maintained the harmony between surface and sea. They could walk in both worlds, speak to all creatures. They were living bridges.\"\nSophia thought of the ghost king's words about her being the seventh keystone. \"So that's why the shadow dragon said I was the key between worlds.\"\nArin nodded. \"Guardian blood runs in your veins, dormant until now. The keystones are waking it up.\"\nA small blue light suddenly appeared between them, floating like a tiny star. It bobbed up and down before zooming around Sophia's head in playful circles.\n\"What is that?\" Sophia asked, reaching out to touch it.\nThe light landed on her finger, warm and pulsing. More appeared, drifting through the water like fireflies.\nTharros and Kael swam over, staring at the lights in wonder.\n\"Light spirits,\" Tharros murmured. \"I haven't seen them since I was young.\"\n\"They shouldn't be here,\" Arin said, her voice worried. \"They belong to the realm between worlds. If they're crossing over...\"\n\"The Division is weakening,\" Kael finished. \"The walls between worlds are cracking.\"\nThe tiny light on Sophia's finger glowed brighter, then disappeared with a small pop. The others followed, winking out like candles.\n\"We need to find the Convergence Point,\" Kael said, clutching the pouch of keystones. \"Before more than just light spirits cross over.\"\nThey swam on, following the pull of the keystones. Sophia felt different with each passing moment. The scales on her skin were spreading, shimmering with blue-green light. Her hair floated around her head like living seaweed, responding to her emotions.\nA pod of dolphins appeared, swimming alongside them. Without thinking, Sophia reached out with her mind.\nHello friends. We seek the Convergence Point.\nThe lead dolphin circled her, its intelligent eye examining her closely.\nGuardian-child. Long have we waited. The breaking-place lies beneath the meeting of currents. We will show you.\nThe dolphins led them through a complicated series of underwater canyons. As they swam, more creatures joined them-sea turtles, rays, even a giant squid that watched from the shadows with its ancient eyes.\nThey come to see the Guardian, the dolphin explained. To see the healing of worlds.\n\"They know what we're doing,\" Sophia told the others. \"They're helping us.\"\nKael smiled, but his eyes remained troubled. \"The Leviathan will know too. It will try to stop us.\"\nA tremor shook the water around them. In the distance, the sea floor cracked open, releasing a cloud of bubbles and more tiny lights-but these ones were red and angry, darting through the water like tiny arrows.\n\"Pain spirits,\" Arin said, creating a barrier of magic. \"The negative emotions from the space between worlds.\"\nOne of the red lights shot through her barrier, striking Tharros on the arm. He roared in pain as a burn appeared on his skin.\n\"We need to hurry!\" Sophia cried.\nThe dolphins swam faster, leading them toward a place where several ocean currents met in a swirling vortex. The water there shimmered strangely, as if reality itself was thin.\nThe breaking-place, the dolphin said. Where the world tore apart long ago.\nMore cracks appeared in the ocean floor, releasing streams of colored lights-spirits crossing from the realm between worlds. Some were beautiful, others terrifying.\n\"The Division is failing,\" Arin shouted over the growing roar of water. \"We don't have much time!\"\nSophia felt a pull deep inside her chest, as if something was calling to her. Without thinking, she swam toward the center of the vortex.\n\"Sophia, wait!\" Kael called, swimming after her.\nBut Sophia couldn't stop. The Guardian blood in her veins sang with ancient power, drawing her to the Convergence Point. As she approached the center, she felt her body changing again. Light poured from her skin, illuminating the dark water around them.\nThis is where it happened, a voice whispered in her mind. Not a fish or dolphin this time, but something older. This is where the world broke apart.\nThe vortex parted before her, revealing a perfectly circular opening in the sea floor. Within it glowed a network of crystal lines, like veins of light spreading outward in all directions.\n\"The heart of the Division,\" Tharros said in awe as he caught up to them.\nSophia reached out her hand, feeling the energy pulsing from the crystal veins. The moment her fingers touched the light, images flooded her mind-two worlds, once united, torn apart by greed and fear; the Guardians fighting to maintain balance; the Leviathan, once a protector, corrupted by the pain of separation.\n\"I can see it all,\" she whispered. \"I can feel it.\"\nThe water around them darkened suddenly. A low rumble shook the Convergence Point. From the depths beyond the crystal heart, a massive shape began to rise-larger than Tharros in dragon form, larger than anything Sophia had ever seen.\nPurple eyes opened in the darkness, dozens of them, all fixed on Sophia and the keystones.\n\"The Leviathan,\" Arin breathed.\nA voice like the crushing depths spoke directly into their minds.\nAT LAST, YOU BRING ME WHAT I SEEK. THE KEYS TO UNLOCK MY PRISON.\n\"Prison?\" Kael asked, confused. \"I thought it wanted to destroy both worlds.\"\nFOOLISH PRINCE. I SEEK NOT DESTRUCTION, BUT REUNION. ON MY TERMS.\nThe massive shape moved closer, revealing a creature both beautiful and terrible-part dragon, part whale, part something ancient that had no name. Its body was covered in scales that absorbed light, and tentacles of pure shadow extended from its sides.\nTHE GUARDIAN RETURNS, BUT TOO LATE. THE DIVISION ENDS TODAY.\nOne massive tentacle shot forward, wrapping around Sophia before anyone could react. She screamed as cold darkness seeped into her skin, reaching for the Guardian power awakening inside her.\n\"Sophia!\" Kael cried, drawing his blade.\nBut the Leviathan pulled her closer to its enormous head, those purple eyes examining her like a curious child with a new toy.\nYOU ARE THE FINAL KEY, LITTLE GUARDIAN. THE BRIDGE BETWEEN WORLDS. WITH YOU, I CAN END THE DIVISION-AND RULE WHAT COMES AFTER.\nSophia struggled against its grip, but the tentacle only tightened. The cold spread through her body, numbing her newfound powers.\n\"Let her go!\" Tharros roared, transforming into his dragon form and charging forward.\nThe Leviathan swatted him away with another tentacle, sending him crashing into a rocky outcrop.\nBRING ME THE KEYSTONES, PRINCE OF TWO KINGDOMS, OR WATCH YOUR GUARDIAN DIE.\nKael looked from the pouch at his side to Sophia, his face torn with anguish.\n\"Don't do it!\" Sophia shouted. \"If it gets all seven keystones-\"\nThe tentacle squeezed tighter, cutting off her words. Darkness crept into the edges of her vision as she fought to stay conscious.\nIn that moment, as her strength faded, Sophia felt something new awakening deep inside her-not just the Guardian blood, but something more primal, more powerful.\nHer eyes began to glow with brilliant light, pushing back the Leviathan's darkness. The water around her heated suddenly, causing the creature to roar in pain.\nIMPOSSIBLE!\n\"I am the seventh keystone,\" Sophia said, her voice echoing with power she didn't understand. \"And you cannot have me.\"\nLight burst from her body in all directions, shattering the Leviathan's grip. As she floated free, glowing like a star in the dark water, the ancient creature retreated slightly, its purple eyes narrowing.\nSO THE GUARDIAN AWAKENS AT LAST. BUT CAN YOU CONTROL WHAT YOU'VE BECOME?\nThe light surrounding Sophia pulsed violently, responding to her emotions. She felt her body changing again, becoming something neither human nor mer, but something new altogether.\nAnd deep in her heart, a terrible fear took root-what if the Leviathan was right? What if she couldn't control the power awakening inside her?\nThe Final Guardian\nSophia floated in the water, her body still glowing with strange power. The Leviathan had retreated for now, but its words echoed in her mind: Can you control what you've become?\n\"We need to act fast,\" Kael said, swimming to her side. \"Are you okay?\"\nSophia nodded, though she felt anything but okay. The power inside her felt wild, untamed, like it might burst out at any moment.\n\"The seventh keystone,\" Arin said, her eyes wide. \"It's not a thing-it's a person. It's you, Sophia.\"\nTharros shook his massive dragon head. \"Not exactly. The legends speak of a Guardian who exists between worlds. Someone who can walk in both realms.\"\n\"But I can't control this,\" Sophia whispered, looking at her glowing hands. \"What if I make things worse?\"\nKael took her hand, not flinching at the light that pulsed between them. \"You won't. We'll help you.\"\nThe crystal heart at the center of the Convergence Point pulsed brighter, as if responding to Sophia's emotions. More cracks appeared in the sea floor around them, releasing streams of spirits-some beautiful, others terrifying.\n\"The Division is breaking down faster,\" Arin said urgently. \"We need to find the seventh keystone now.\"\n\"But I thought I was the keystone,\" Sophia said, confused.\nTharros shook his head. \"You have Guardian blood, yes. But the seventh keystone is guarded by someone who exists in both worlds at once. Someone who can help you fully awaken your powers.\"\nThe dolphins circled back, their thoughts urgent in Sophia's mind.\nThe guardian waits at the edge of the great crack. You must all go together. Hurry!\n\"This way,\" Sophia said, following the dolphins toward the deepest part of the Convergence Point.\nAs they swam, the water grew thicker, almost like swimming through honey. Colors swirled around them-blues, purples, greens-as if reality itself was melting.\n\"We're approaching the boundary between worlds,\" Arin explained. \"The rules of reality are different here.\"\nThey arrived at a massive crack in the ocean floor, so deep that no light penetrated its depths. It wasn't just a physical crack-it seemed to be a tear in reality itself.\n\"Now what?\" Kael asked, staring into the abyss.\n\"The dolphins said the guardian waits at the edge,\" Sophia reminded them. \"But I don't see anyone.\"\nArin closed her eyes, concentrating. \"There's powerful magic here. Ancient magic.\" Her eyes snapped open. \"We need to join our consciousness. It's the only way to see beyond the veil.\"\n\"Join our consciousness?\" Sophia asked nervously.\n\"A mind-merge,\" Tharros explained. \"It's dangerous, but it might work.\"\n\"What do we do?\" Kael asked.\n\"Form a circle,\" Arin instructed. \"Hold hands.\"\nThey formed a circle at the edge of the crack-Sophia, Kael, Arin, and Tharros in his human form. The keystones in Kael's pouch began to glow brightly.\n\"Focus on Sophia,\" Arin said. \"She's our anchor between worlds.\"\nSophia felt their concentration like a physical weight. The power inside her surged in response, light pouring from her skin. The water around them began to swirl, creating a whirlpool of energy.\n\"Don't fight it,\" Arin whispered. \"Let it flow through you.\"\nSophia closed her eyes and surrendered to the power. Suddenly, she wasn't just herself anymore-she could feel Kael's steady courage, Arin's ancient wisdom, and Tharros's fierce protectiveness. Their thoughts flowed into hers, and hers into theirs.\nWhen she opened her eyes, the world had changed. The crack was now a doorway of light, and standing before it was a figure unlike any she'd seen before-half human, half something else, with skin that shifted between scales and flesh, eyes that changed color with each blink.\n\"The Guardian,\" Tharros whispered in awe.\nThe Guardian looked at each of them, its gaze penetrating.\n\"You seek the final keystone,\" it said, its voice both in their ears and in their minds. \"But are you worthy?\"\nBefore anyone could answer, the world around them shifted. Sophia found herself alone in a dark laboratory, surrounded by tanks of captured sea creatures. Horror filled her as she realized she was watching herself-dissecting a young mer-child for research.\n\"No!\" she screamed. \"I would never do this!\"\n\"Wouldn't you?\" the Guardian's voice asked. \"You're a scientist. Isn't knowledge worth any price?\"\nSophia watched as her other self looked up, eyes cold and calculating. \"This isn't me,\" Sophia whispered. \"I want to protect both worlds, not destroy them.\"\nThe scene shifted again. Now she stood on a beach covered in dead fish and oil-slicked birds-the result of human pollution.\n\"Your kind did this,\" the Guardian said. \"Why should I trust you with the power to change worlds?\"\nSophia felt tears streaming down her face. \"Because I've seen both sides now. I understand what's at stake. Please-I want to heal this division, not exploit it.\"\nThe darkness faded. Sophia found herself back in the circle with the others, all looking shaken.\n\"You all faced your fears,\" the Guardian said. \"The prince who fears he's unworthy of his crown. The witch who fears her own power. The dragon who fears being the last of his kind.\" Its eyes settled on Sophia. \"And the human who fears becoming a monster.\"\nThe Guardian approached Sophia, placing a hand on her heart. \"Your fear is the strongest barrier to your power. The seventh keystone is not an object-it is the unlock to your full potential.\"",

        "content": "Light flowed from the Guardian's hand into Sophia's chest. The power that had been chaotic inside her suddenly calmed, finding its proper channels.\n\"You are the bridge, Sophia Rodriguez. Neither fully human nor fully mer, but something new. Something needed.\"\nThe Guardian stepped back, its form beginning to fade. \"The Leviathan seeks to force the worlds together in chaos. Only you can guide the reunion with harmony.\"\n\"Wait!\" Sophia called. \"How do I use this power?\"\n\"You already know,\" the Guardian said, its voice fading. \"Trust yourself. Trust your bond with the others.\"\nAs the Guardian vanished, the water around them exploded with light. The six keystones flew from Kael's pouch, surrounding Sophia in a circle.\n\"What's happening?\" Kael shouted.\nSophia felt knowledge flowing into her mind-ancient memories, forgotten magic. She understood now. The keystones weren't just keys-they were focal points of power.\n\"I know what to do,\" she said, her voice echoing with new authority. \"The keystones need to be placed at specific points around the world where the barriers are thinnest.\"\nArin's eyes widened. \"A stabilization matrix! Of course!\"\nBefore they could discuss further, a deafening roar shook the water. The Leviathan had returned, and it wasn't alone. An army of shadow creatures swarmed behind it.\nYOU CANNOT STOP WHAT IS COMING, GUARDIAN. THE DIVISION ENDS TODAY.\nThe keystones flickered in response to the Leviathan's presence. Sophia felt her newfound control wavering.\n\"We need to get the keystones to safety,\" Tharros said, transforming back into his dragon form. \"Now!\"\nSophia clutched the keystones close as Tharros swept his massive tail, clearing a path through the approaching shadows.\n\"Go!\" Arin shouted, her hands glowing with defensive magic. \"Kael and I will hold them off!\"\n\"I won't leave you!\" Sophia cried.\nKael grabbed her shoulders. \"You have to. You're the only one who can place the keystones now.\"\nThe shadow creatures surged forward. Kael drew his blade, its edge glowing with an inner light.\n\"I'll find you,\" Sophia promised, her heart breaking at the thought of leaving them.\nAs Tharros pulled her away, Sophia watched Kael and Arin standing against the tide of darkness, two small figures against an overwhelming force.\nThe last thing she saw before Tharros swept her into the open ocean was the Leviathan's massive form descending upon her friends, its purple eyes gleaming with victory.\nThe Descent to Lumaria\nSophia clung to Tharros's dragon scales as they shot through the water. The six keystones pulsed in the pouch at her side, each one warm against her hip. Her mind raced with worry for Kael and Arin, left behind to face the Leviathan and its army of shadows.\n\"We have to go back for them!\" she shouted over the rush of water.\nTharros's voice rumbled in her mind. We cannot. The keystones must be protected. Kael and Arin knew the risks.\nTears mixed with the seawater on Sophia's face. Her newfound Guardian powers still buzzed beneath her skin, making the water around her glow slightly. The memory of the Guardian's words echoed in her mind: You are the bridge, Sophia Rodriguez.\n\"Where are we going?\" she asked, trying to focus on their mission instead of her fear.\nTo Lumaria, Tharros replied. The ancient city holds the answers we seek. It's where the keystones were forged.\nThey swam for what felt like hours, diving deeper into the ocean. The water grew colder and darker until Sophia could barely see. Only Tharros's natural glow lit their way.\n\"How much farther?\" Sophia asked, shivering.\nNot far now. The entrance is hidden, but the keystones will guide us.\nAs if responding to his words, the keystones began to glow brighter, pulsing in a strange rhythm. Sophia pulled them out, holding them in her palm. They hovered above her hand, spinning slowly in a circle.\n\"They're pointing that way,\" she said, gesturing to a seemingly solid wall of rock ahead.\nTharros swam toward the rock face. The entrance is concealed by ancient magic. Only a Guardian can see it.\nSophia stared at the rock wall, concentrating. At first, she saw nothing. Then, slowly, a pattern emerged-faint lines of light forming the shape of a door.\n\"I see it!\" she exclaimed.\nShe placed her hand against the rock. Instead of feeling solid stone, her fingers passed through as if touching water. The rock rippled around her hand.\n\"It's an illusion,\" she whispered in awe.\nNot quite, Tharros said. It's a threshold between realities. Only those with permission may pass.\nSophia took a deep breath. \"Let's go.\"\nThey swam forward, passing through the rock as if it were nothing but a curtain of water. On the other side, Sophia gasped.\nA vast city spread out below them, nestled in an enormous underwater cavern. Crystal spires reached toward the cavern ceiling, glowing with blue-green light. Buildings made of shimmering coral and strange, iridescent metal formed streets and plazas. The entire city was enclosed in a giant bubble of shimmering energy.\n\"Lumaria,\" Sophia breathed.\nThe ancient home of the Guardians, Tharros confirmed. Untouched for thousands of years.\nThey swam down toward the city center, where a massive temple stood. Its walls were covered in the same symbols Sophia had seen on the keystones.\n\"It's beautiful,\" she said. \"How has no one found this before?\"\nThe city moves, Tharros explained. It exists partially in the space between worlds. Only the keystones can locate it.\nAs they approached the temple, Sophia noticed something strange. The water inside the city's bubble wasn't quite water-it was thicker, more like air.\n\"I can breathe normally here,\" she realized, no longer using her gills.\nLumaria exists in both worlds at once, Tharros said, transforming back into his human form as they landed on a wide plaza. Like you.\nSophia looked around in wonder. The plaza was paved with stones that glowed faintly when stepped on. Buildings rose on all sides, their architecture unlike anything she'd seen-curves and angles that seemed to bend reality.\n\"What now?\" she asked.\nTharros pointed to the temple. \"We must take the keystones to the central chamber. There's a device there that can use their power to repair the Division.\"\nAs they walked through the empty streets, Sophia felt a strange sense of familiarity. \"I feel like I've been here before,\" she said.\n\"The Guardian blood in your veins remembers,\" Tharros replied. \"Your ancestors walked these streets.\"\nThey reached the temple steps, a grand staircase made of crystal that changed color as they ascended. The entrance was a massive archway carved with symbols that moved and shifted as Sophia watched.\n\"Can you read it?\" she asked.\nTharros shook his head. \"Only a full Guardian can read the ancient language.\"\nSophia stared at the symbols, and to her surprise, they began to make sense. \"It says... 'Enter, Guardians of the Balance, and claim your birthright.'\"\nInside the temple, a vast hall stretched before them. Pillars of living coral rose to the ceiling, which was a dome of clear crystal showing the ocean above. In the center of the hall stood a circular platform with seven indentations-one for each keystone.\n\"This is it,\" Tharros said. \"The Balancing Chamber.\"\nSophia approached the platform, the keystones hovering around her. \"What happens when we place them?\"\n\"The legend says they will stabilize the Division, preventing the worlds from crashing together in chaos.\"\nA cold voice echoed through the hall. \"Or they could tear down the barriers completely.\"\nSophia spun around. A figure stood in the temple entrance-not Kael or Arin, but someone she'd never seen before. A woman with skin as pale as pearl and hair that floated like living seaweed.\n\"Who are you?\" Tharros demanded, stepping protectively in front of Sophia.\nThe woman smiled, showing teeth that were slightly too sharp. \"I am Maris, last survivor of the original Guardians. And you have something that belongs to me.\"\nSophia clutched the keystones closer. \"You're lying. The Guardians died out centuries ago.\"\n\"Not all of us,\" Maris said, gliding forward. \"Some of us chose a different path. The Division was a mistake, one I've waited millennia to correct.\"\nUnderstanding dawned on Sophia. \"You work with the Leviathan.\"\nMaris laughed, the sound like breaking glass. \"Work with it? My dear, I created it. From my own flesh and blood, to serve a greater purpose.\"\nTharros growled, beginning to transform. \"Stay back!\"\n\"Oh, dragon king,\" Maris sighed. \"So protective of your new mate. Did you tell her what happens to a Guardian when they activate the keystones? Did you tell her the price?\"\nSophia looked at Tharros, who wouldn't meet her eyes. \"What is she talking about?\"\n\"He didn't tell you,\" Maris said, grinning. \"The final keystone requires a sacrifice. A life freely given. That's why the Guardians died out-we refused to pay the price anymore.\"\n\"Is this true?\" Sophia asked Tharros.\nBefore he could answer, a massive tremor shook the temple. Chunks of coral fell from the ceiling.\n\"The Leviathan approaches,\" Maris said. \"It seems your friends didn't hold it back for long.\"\nFear clutched at Sophia's heart. \"What happened to Kael and Arin?\"\n\"Oh, they're alive. For now. The Leviathan wants them to witness the reunification.\"\nAnother tremor, stronger this time. The temple walls began to crack.\n\"We're out of time,\" Tharros said. \"Sophia, you must decide. We can try to escape with the keystones, or...\"\n\"Or what?\"\n\"Or you activate them,\" Maris finished. \"And pay the price.\"\nSophia looked down at the keystones, still hovering around her. \"What exactly happens if I activate them?\"\n\"The Division will be healed,\" Tharros said quietly. \"The barriers between worlds will be strengthened. The Leviathan will be contained once more.\"\n\"At the cost of your life,\" Maris added. \"Is that really worth it? Wouldn't it be better to let the worlds reunite? To end the separation that has caused so much pain?\"\nA final, violent tremor shook the temple. The entrance collapsed, debris blocking their escape. Through the crystal dome, Sophia could see a massive shadow approaching-the Leviathan, with what looked like two small figures trapped in its tentacles.\n\"Kael! Arin!\" she cried.\nThe keystones pulsed urgently, their light growing brighter. Sophia felt the Guardian power inside her responding, pulling her toward the platform.\nMaris extended her hand. \"Give me the keystones, child. Let me finish what I started centuries ago. You don't have to die today.\"\nSophia looked from Maris to Tharros, from the approaching Leviathan to the ancient platform. The choice weighed on her like the entire ocean.\n\"What would happen if the worlds reunited in chaos?\" she asked.\n\"Destruction on a scale you cannot imagine,\" Tharros said grimly. \"Millions would die, both above and below the waves.\"\nSophia took a deep breath, feeling the power of generations of Guardians flowing through her veins. She stepped toward the platform.\n\"Sophia, no!\" Maris lunged forward.\nBut it was too late. Sophia had made her choice.\nThe Sacrifice of Light\nSophia stood at the edge of decision, the keystones humming with ancient power in her hands. Below her, the circular platform waited with its seven empty slots-one for each keystone.\n\"Don't listen to her,\" Tharros urged, his eyes fixed on Maris. \"There's always more to these ancient magics than anyone remembers.\"\nAnother violent shake rocked the temple. Through the crystal dome, the massive shadow of the Leviathan grew closer. Sophia could see Kael and Arin struggling in its grip, their faces contorted with effort as they fought against their captor.",

        "content": "\"I have to try,\" Sophia whispered.\nWith steady hands, she approached the platform. The keystones lifted from her palms, spinning faster now, eager to find their homes.\n\"No!\" Maris lunged forward, her seaweed hair writhing like snakes. \"You don't understand what you're doing!\"\nTharros moved with shocking speed, grabbing Maris and holding her back. \"This is her choice to make.\"\nOne by one, the keystones settled into their slots on the platform. As the sixth one clicked into place, Sophia realized there was still one empty slot. Her fingers traced the final indentation, perfectly sized for something she didn't have.\n\"The seventh keystone,\" she murmured.\nMaris laughed bitterly. \"Now you see. The final piece is you, Guardian. Your life force. Your entire being.\"\nSophia looked up at the crystal dome where her friends fought for their lives. She thought of the surface world, of all the people who would never know how close they came to destruction. She thought of her journey from scientist to something more.\n\"I understand,\" she said quietly. And she did.\nPlacing her palm over the seventh slot, Sophia closed her eyes. The moment her skin touched the ancient stone, white-hot energy shot up her arm. Her back arched as power surged through her body.\nSuddenly, she wasn't in the temple anymore.\nSophia floated in an endless sea of stars. Before her stood figures of light-men and women with glowing eyes and translucent skin that shimmered with the same power she now felt burning through her veins.\n\"Welcome, sister,\" said a voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.\n\"The Guardians,\" Sophia breathed.\nA woman stepped forward, her form brighter than the others. \"I was the first to make the sacrifice. To give myself to the Division.\"\n\"Did you... die?\" Sophia asked.\nThe woman's laugh was like bells. \"Death is such a limited concept. We transformed.\"\nOthers came forward, each showing Sophia visions of their own moments of choice. Some faced great beasts, others stood alone against armies of darkness. All had placed their hands upon the seventh slot.\n\"The sacrifice isn't your life,\" explained an ancient Guardian with eyes like the deepest ocean. \"It's your former self. What you were must die so what you are meant to be can live.\"\n\"But Maris said-\"\n\"Maris chose another path,\" interrupted a younger Guardian. \"She feared the transformation. She sought to control the power rather than become one with it.\"\nThe first Guardian took Sophia's hands. \"The question is: are you willing to let go of who you were to become who you must be?\"\nBack in the temple, Sophia's body glowed with intense blue light. Her hair floated around her head as if she were underwater. Tharros watched in awe, still restraining the struggling Maris.\n\"Stop her!\" Maris screamed. \"She'll ruin everything!\"\nThe temple trembled more violently now. Cracks appeared in the crystal dome as the Leviathan pressed against it.\nSophia opened her eyes, which now shone with pure white light. \"I choose to become,\" she said, her voice echoing with power.\nThe keystones erupted with blinding energy, connecting to Sophia through beams of light. She rose into the air, suspended by their power. Her skin began to change, becoming both solid and translucent at once. Patches of iridescent scales appeared along her arms and neck, but they weren't mer scales-they seemed made of living light.\nTharros watched, transfixed. This wasn't death. This was rebirth.\nMaris stopped struggling, her face a mask of disbelief. \"Impossible,\" she whispered. \"The transformation should have killed her.\"\n\"You never understood the true meaning of sacrifice,\" Tharros said quietly.\nOutside, the Leviathan recoiled as Sophia's light grew brighter. Its massive form writhed in apparent pain, loosening its grip on Kael and Arin.\nInside Sophia's mind, the Guardians spoke one last time. \"Remember, the Division was never meant to separate, but to create balance. You are the bridge, Sophia Rodriguez. Not between worlds, but between possibilities.\"\nThe light reached its peak intensity, then collapsed inward. Sophia dropped gently to the platform, her transformation complete.\nShe looked different now. Her eyes held galaxies. Her skin shimmered with patterns of light that moved like ocean currents. When she moved, she seemed to exist in multiple places at once, leaving trails of luminescence behind her.\n\"I understand now,\" Sophia said, her voice layered with harmonics that hadn't been there before. \"The sacrifice isn't dying. It's becoming something new.\"\nShe turned to face Maris, who had fallen to her knees in shock.\n\"You chose power over transformation. You feared losing yourself.\" Sophia's eyes were kind but powerful. \"That's why you created the Leviathan. Not to tear down the Division, but to avoid your own evolution.\"\nMaris shook her head, tears streaming down her face. \"You don't understand what it's like to lose your humanity piece by piece!\"\n\"I understand perfectly,\" Sophia replied, looking down at her transformed hands. \"I've just chosen to embrace it.\"\nThe temple shook again, more violently this time. Large chunks of the ceiling crashed down around them. The Leviathan had recovered from its momentary retreat and now attacked with renewed fury.\n\"The transformation isn't enough,\" Tharros said urgently. \"The Division is still damaged. The keystones need more time to repair it.\"\nSophia nodded, her movements leaving trails of light in the water. \"Then we'll give them time.\"\nShe rose into the air, passing through the crystal dome as if it were made of mist. Outside, she faced the Leviathan directly for the first time. The creature was massive beyond belief, its tentacles stretching for miles, its single eye larger than the temple itself.\nKael and Arin, still caught in its grip, stared in wonder at Sophia's transformed state.\n\"Sophia?\" Kael called out, his voice faint in the vastness of the deep.\nShe smiled at them, her familiar warmth somehow present despite her otherworldly appearance. \"I'm still me,\" she called back. \"Just... more.\"\nThe Leviathan roared, a sound that vibrated through the water and shook the very foundations of Lumaria. It lashed out with a tentacle as thick as a redwood tree, aiming straight for Sophia.\nShe raised her hand, and a shield of pure energy formed around her. The tentacle struck it and recoiled as if burned.\n\"I am a Guardian of the Division,\" Sophia declared, her voice carrying impossible distances. \"And you will not destroy what we have built.\"\nThe Leviathan's eye narrowed. Then, to everyone's shock, it spoke directly into their minds.\n\"You think yourself powerful, new Guardian? You have only just awakened. I have existed since before the Division. I AM the chaos that was tamed.\"\nIt surged forward with tremendous speed, all its tentacles aimed at Sophia. She braced herself, gathering her new powers-but would they be enough?\nAs the Leviathan closed in, Sophia realized with sudden clarity that she couldn't defeat this ancient being alone. Not even with her Guardian powers. She needed Tharros, Kael, and Arin. She needed the bond they had forged together.\nThe monster's tentacles wrapped around her shield, squeezing with incredible pressure. Cracks appeared in her energy barrier.\nInside the temple, Tharros watched in horror as Sophia's light began to dim under the Leviathan's assault.\n\"We have to help her,\" he growled, turning to Maris. \"You created that thing. You must know how to stop it.\"\nMaris looked up, her eyes haunted with centuries of regret. \"I never meant for this to happen,\" she whispered. \"I only wanted to be free.\"\nAs Sophia's shield began to fail and the Leviathan's grip tightened, a terrible realization dawned. The transformation wasn't the sacrifice. It was just the beginning.\nHearts United, Magic Ignited\nAs the Leviathan's tentacles crushed her energy shield, Sophia felt something shift inside her. The Guardian power that had transformed her wasn't meant to be used alone-it was meant to connect.\n\"Tharros! Kael! Arin!\" she called out, her voice echoing through water and mind alike.\nIn that moment of desperation, her new Guardian senses stretched beyond the temple, beyond the crushing grip of the Leviathan. She could feel them-three bright flames of life and magic, each one tied to her soul.\nThe Leviathan's eye widened as Sophia's body suddenly blazed with renewed light. Her shield didn't just repair itself-it exploded outward in a burst of energy that sent the monster reeling back.\n\"Enough hiding,\" Sophia muttered. With a flick of her wrist, she tore open the temple's dome completely and soared upward through the gap.\nFree from the confines of the ancient structure, Sophia faced the Leviathan directly. It towered before her, a nightmare of darkness and ancient rage. In its tentacles, Kael and Arin still struggled weakly, their strength fading.",

        "content": "\"Let them go,\" Sophia demanded, her voice calm but powerful.\nThe Leviathan's response was a mental roar of defiance that shook the ocean floor. \"They are mine! As you will be!\"\nSophia didn't argue. Instead, she raised both hands and focused her Guardian energy into twin beams of light that sliced through the tentacles holding her friends. The severed limbs dissolved into dark particles that scattered in the currents.\nKael and Arin dropped free, swimming weakly toward Sophia. She created a bubble of energy around them, pulling them close as the Leviathan howled in rage.\n\"Sophia?\" Arin gasped, staring at her transformed appearance. \"What happened to you?\"\n\"Later,\" Sophia said, her eyes fixed on the temple below where Tharros still held Maris. \"We need to get back to Tharros.\"\nWith a thought, she propelled the energy bubble downward, darting past the Leviathan's grabbing tentacles and back through the broken dome. They landed beside Tharros, who immediately released Maris to embrace them all.\n\"I thought I'd lost you,\" he growled, his voice thick with emotion.\nKael pulled away first, his warrior instincts on alert. \"We don't have time for reunions. That thing is right behind us.\"\nTrue to his words, the Leviathan's massive form blocked the opening above, its eye peering down at them with ancient hatred.\n\"What do we do now?\" Arin asked, her sea witch powers already gathering around her hands in swirls of green magic.\nMaris stepped forward, her earlier anger replaced by something like awe as she gazed at Sophia. \"You did what I couldn't,\" she whispered. \"You embraced the transformation instead of fighting it.\"\n\"Why didn't you?\" Sophia asked.\nMaris's face twisted with old pain. \"I was the last of my generation of Guardians. I watched as, one by one, my friends placed their hands on that platform and disappeared into light.\" Her voice broke. \"They said it was transformation, not death, but none of them ever returned. I was alone, afraid...\"\n\"So you created the Leviathan instead,\" Tharros finished, his voice surprisingly gentle.\nMaris nodded. \"I thought I could control the Division without the sacrifice. I poured my Guardian powers into creating a being that could manipulate the barriers between worlds.\" Her laugh was bitter. \"But it had its own will from the start. It didn't want to control the Division-it wanted to destroy it.\"\nA thunderous crash interrupted them as one of the Leviathan's tentacles smashed through the temple wall.\n\"Enough talk,\" Kael said, drawing his blade. \"We fight.\"\n\"No,\" Sophia said suddenly, her transformed eyes seeing connections that weren't visible before. \"We don't fight-we bond.\"\nShe turned to face her three mates, ignoring Maris and the approaching monster. \"This is what the Guardians meant. I'm not meant to face this alone. We're stronger together-that's always been the truth behind the prophecy.\"\nTharros understood first. \"The bond ritual... here? Now?\"\n\"Yes,\" Sophia nodded. \"The four of us, our powers joined as one.\"\nArin's eyes widened. \"But the binding ceremony takes preparation, sacred words-\"\n\"Not anymore,\" Sophia interrupted, taking Arin's hand. \"I am a Guardian now. I can see the pattern of the bond. It's not words that matter-it's hearts.\"\nThe temple shook violently as more tentacles broke through the walls. Water began to rush in through the cracks. The ancient structure was failing.\n\"We don't have time,\" Kael warned, but he too reached for Sophia's hand.\nTharros completed the circle, his large hand covering both Kael's and Arin's. \"I trust you,\" he told Sophia, his eyes filled with love and determination.\nAs their hands joined, Sophia's Guardian power flowed through them all. Their hearts beat as one, and each of their unique magics rose to the surface.\nTharros's dragon might manifested as a golden glow, ancient and proud.\nKael's warrior strength appeared as a silver fire, brave and protective.\nArin's sea witch sorcery swirled like emerald currents, mysterious and wise.\nAnd at the center, binding them all, Sophia's Guardian magic shone with pure white light, bridging their differences and amplifying their strengths.\n\"I can feel you,\" Arin gasped, tears floating from her eyes. \"All of you, inside me.\"\n\"We are one,\" Tharros rumbled, his voice changed by the power flowing through him.\nKael simply smiled, his normally guarded expression open with wonder.\nThe Leviathan sensed their growing power and attacked with renewed fury. The temple walls collapsed entirely, and the ancient creature wrapped its tentacles around their circle of light.\nBut this time, its touch couldn't harm them. The darkness of its body recoiled from their combined glow.\n\"IMPOSSIBLE!\" it roared in their minds.\n\"Nothing is impossible when hearts truly unite,\" Sophia replied, her voice carrying the echoes of her mates.\nTheir joined power pulsed outward, forcing the Leviathan back. For the first time, fear showed in its massive eye.\nBut Sophia could feel that their bond, though strong, wasn't complete. The four-way connection flickered like a flame in the wind, not yet stable enough to defeat a being as ancient as the Leviathan.\n\"It's not enough,\" she told the others through their mental link. \"The bond needs to be sealed.\"\n\"How?\" they asked in unison.\nBefore Sophia could answer, Maris stepped into their circle of light.\n\"I know how,\" she said quietly. \"I've watched the bonding ritual a thousand times, always from the outside. The final step requires a catalyst-a fifth energy to complete the pattern.\"\n\"Why would you help us?\" Tharros asked, suspicious despite their dire situation.\nMaris looked at the Leviathan, her creation, as it gathered its strength for another attack. \"Because I was wrong,\" she said simply. \"For centuries, I chose power over love, control over connection. I watched your kind find happiness in bonds while I remained alone.\" She turned back to them, determination in her eyes. \"Let me do one right thing before the end.\"\nThe Leviathan's roar shook the ocean as it rushed toward them again, this time with its full mass. The aftershock scattered the rubble of the fallen temple, leaving them exposed on the bare platform with the keystones still glowing in their slots.\n\"Now or never,\" Kael warned.\nSophia looked into each of her mates' eyes, feeling their love and trust flow through their joined hands. Then she nodded to Maris. \"Show us.\"\nMaris placed her hands over theirs, her ancient Guardian power-long dormant but never truly gone-awakening at the touch.\n\"The bond requires more than just joined power,\" she explained quickly. \"It needs the joining of souls. Each of you must offer your true self to the others-no secrets, no barriers.\"\nAs the Leviathan's shadow fell over them, Maris began to chant in a language older than Lumaria itself. The keystones responded, their light connecting to the circle of mates.\n\"Now!\" Maris urged. \"Open yourselves completely!\"\nSophia took a deep breath and let her innermost self flow outward. Her scientific curiosity, her fierce loyalty, her fears and hopes-all laid bare for her mates to see and know.\nTharros followed, revealing his centuries of loneliness, his royal burden, and the tender heart he kept hidden behind dragon scales.\nKael shared his warrior's pain, the battles that haunted him, his secret royal blood, and the love he'd never dared express.\nArin was last, hesitant to expose her darkest secrets-her exile, her forbidden magics, and the desperate longing for acceptance that drove her.\nAs the final barriers between them fell away, their joined power stabilized, forming a perfect harmony of energies. The white, gold, silver, and emerald lights twisted together into a single brilliant beam that shot upward, straight into the Leviathan's approaching form.\nThe monster screamed-a sound of both rage and recognition. The beam cut through its darkness, revealing something unexpected at its core.\n\"Is that-?\" Arin gasped.\n\"A heart,\" Sophia confirmed, seeing through her Guardian vision. \"Not evil, but corrupted.\"\nThe Leviathan wavered, caught between attack and retreat, sensing the change in their united power.\nMaris stepped back from their circle, her part complete. \"The bond is formed,\" she said. \"But to truly defeat the Leviathan, you must reach its heart.\"\nAs the ancient beast gathered itself for a final, desperate attack, Sophia felt their newly completed bond thrumming with potential. They were stronger together than they had ever been apart, but was it enough to face the primordial chaos of the Leviathan?\nShe squeezed her mates' hands. \"Whatever happens next, remember this feeling. We are one now, forever.\"\nThe Leviathan surged forward, its massive form blocking out all light except their own glowing circle. Four hearts beat as one, ready to face the darkness.\nBut as their joined power met the Leviathan's charge, something unexpected happened. Instead of a clash, there was a connection-one that none of them were prepared for.\nThe Binding of Four Hearts\nThe Leviathan's dark form crashed into their circle of light. But instead of breaking through, it stopped, as if hitting an invisible wall. Inside the monster's massive body, something pulsed-a heart that didn't match the darkness around it.\n\"I can see it,\" Sophia gasped, her vision enhanced by her Guardian powers. \"The Leviathan has a heart! It's not just darkness.\"\n\"Impossible,\" Maris whispered from outside their circle. \"I created it from pure magic and rage.\"\nThe four mates stood unbroken, their hands still joined as power flowed between them. The white, gold, silver, and emerald lights of their combined magic twisted together like a rope of light.\n\"Every living thing has a heart,\" Tharros said, his dragon magic flaring brighter. \"Even creatures born of darkness.\"\nThe Leviathan roared, both in their minds and through the water, sending powerful waves crashing against their shield. \"YOU WILL FALL!\"\nKael squeezed Sophia's hand. \"Our bond isn't complete yet. I can feel the gaps between us.\"\n\"What's missing?\" Arin asked, her sea witch powers swirling around them in green ribbons of magic.\nSophia closed her eyes, feeling the pattern of energy between them. \"Truth,\" she said finally. \"Complete truth between us all.\"\nThe Leviathan struck again, this time with enough force to make their shield flicker. They didn't have much time.\n\"I'll start,\" Tharros said, his voice deeper than usual as his dragon nature showed through his human form. \"For centuries, I ruled alone because I feared sharing power would make me weak. But I was wrong. With you three, I am stronger than I ever was alone.\"\nHis golden dragon magic surged, filling the gaps in their shield and pushing back the darkness. The Leviathan hissed in pain.\n\"My turn,\" Kael said. His silver warrior magic burned brighter as he spoke. \"I've hidden my royal blood for years, afraid of the responsibility it carried. I am Prince Kael Stormwind, rightful heir to the Eastern Seas. I ran from my destiny until I found all of you.\"\nAs he spoke, ancient marks appeared on his skin-royal symbols that matched the tattoos on Tharros's arms. Their enemies had been searching for the missing prince for years, never guessing he served as Tharros's general.\nThe Leviathan screamed again, but its voice seemed weaker now. Parts of its dark body began to shimmer with light from within.\n\"I suppose that means I'm next,\" Arin said, her voice shaking slightly. \"I was banished from my home for using dark magic. I wanted power so badly that I didn't care who I hurt. But with you three, I've found something better than power-I've found belonging.\"\nAs she spoke, her emerald magic changed, losing the shadowy edges it once had. It flowed pure and bright now, healing the cracks in their shield where the Leviathan had struck.\nAll eyes turned to Sophia.\n\"My secret is that I've been afraid,\" she admitted. \"Afraid that I wasn't meant to be here, that I didn't deserve any of you. But now I understand-the Guardian power chose me because I could love all of you equally, completely.\"\nHer white Guardian light expanded, weaving through their combined magics and binding them together in new patterns.\nThe Leviathan thrashed wildly, its tentacles lashing out in all directions as light began to break through its dark body.\n\"The bond is almost complete,\" Maris called from outside their circle. \"But it needs to be sealed with a final act.\"\n\"What act?\" Sophia asked, feeling the power building between them, eager for release.\nThe temple floor beneath them began to glow, ancient symbols lighting up one by one.\n\"A promise,\" Maris answered. \"A promise that binds your souls together for eternity.\"\nThe four mates looked at each other, understanding flowing between them without words. Their bond had grown so strong that they could feel each other's thoughts, each other's hearts.\n\"I promise to protect you all with my strength and my life,\" Tharros said, his eyes glowing gold.\n\"I promise to fight for our bond, to never abandon what we've built together,\" Kael added, silver light shining from his hands.\n\"I promise to use my powers for healing, not harm, and to help us grow stronger together,\" Arin said, tears floating from her eyes as green light surrounded her.\nSophia looked at each of them, feeling their love wash over her like warm waves. \"And I promise to be the bridge that keeps us connected, through darkness and light, always.\"\nAs the last word left her lips, their combined magic exploded outward. The shield didn't just push the Leviathan back-it passed through the creature, filling it with light.\nThe monster's mighty form shuddered. Its terrible roar changed to something almost like a song. The darkness that had made up its body began to dissolve, revealing something unexpected underneath.\n\"Look!\" Arin gasped.\nWhere the terrible Leviathan had been, a swirl of pure magic now floated-blue and purple and silver, like the most beautiful aurora they had ever seen.\nMaris stepped forward, her eyes wide with wonder. \"It's returning to its original form. Before my rage corrupted it.\"\nThe magic swirled around them, brushing against their joined hands like a curious child. Then it shot upward, breaking through the water's surface far above and disappearing into the sky.\n\"What was that?\" Kael asked, still holding tight to his mates' hands.\n\"The Division itself,\" Maris whispered. \"The magic that separates worlds. I tried to control it, but instead I corrupted it into the Leviathan.\"\nThe light from their joined magic began to fade, but something new remained-a golden thread connecting their hearts, visible only to them.\n\"The bond is complete,\" Sophia said, feeling the new connection between them. It was like having three extra heartbeats alongside her own.\nTharros pulled them all into a tight embrace. \"We did it.\"\nBut as they celebrated, the temple floor beneath them gave a sudden, violent shake. Pieces of the broken ceiling crashed down around them.\n\"What's happening?\" Arin asked, looking up in alarm.\nMaris's face paled. \"The temple was maintained by the Leviathan's power for centuries. Without it...\"\nAnother violent shake sent them stumbling. The glowing platform beneath their feet cracked down the middle.\n\"The whole place is collapsing!\" Kael shouted over the rumble of falling stone.\nWater rushed in from all sides as the ancient structure began to fall apart completely.\nSophia reached for her mates, feeling their new bond pulse with power. \"Stay together!\"\nAs the temple collapsed around them, Maris looked at the four bonded mates with an expression of both sorrow and hope. \"Find the other temples,\" she called to them as water and stone separated them. \"The Division is still unstable. Your bond is just the beginning!\"\nThen a massive wave of debris swept her away, disappearing into the swirling chaos.\nThe last thing Sophia saw before darkness took her was her three mates reaching for her, their faces determined even as the world fell apart around them.\nTheir bond hummed between them, stronger than stone, deeper than the sea.\nThis was not the end.\nIt was just the beginning.\nHealing the Division\nSophia woke to gentle swaying. She was floating in a bubble of light, her three mates unconscious beside her. Around them, the ruins of the temple lay scattered across the ocean floor.\n\"We're alive,\" she whispered, reaching out to touch Tharros's face. Their bond hummed between them, new and strong.\nOne by one, the others stirred. Kael sat up first, warrior instincts making him scan for danger. Arin followed, her hands immediately glowing with healing magic as she checked them for injuries. Tharros was last, his large form curling protectively around the others.\n\"The temple is gone,\" Arin said, looking at the destruction around them.\n\"But we survived,\" Kael added, his hand finding Sophia's.",

        "content": "Tharros frowned. \"Where's Maris?\"\nA faint shimmer in the water answered his question. Maris appeared from behind a fallen column, looking weaker but alive.\n\"You're still here,\" she said, surprise in her voice. \"I thought you'd flee after the collapse.\"\n\"We wouldn't leave without answers,\" Sophia replied. Through her Guardian senses, she could feel something different about the water around them. \"Something's changed.\"\nMaris nodded. \"The Division is weakening. Without the Leviathan to maintain it or destroy it, it's becoming unstable.\"\n\"What exactly is the Division?\" Tharros asked, his voice rumbling with authority.\nInstead of answering, Maris pointed to the shattered platform where they had stood during their bonding. The keystones were still there, glowing faintly despite being buried under rubble.\n\"Those aren't just decorations,\" she explained. \"They're the control points for the Division.\"\nWith their bond still fresh and strong, the four mates worked together to clear the debris. Their different powers made the job easy - Tharros's strength, Kael's precision, Arin's magic, and Sophia's Guardian light guiding them.\nWhen the keystones were uncovered, Sophia gasped. They were arranged in a pattern she recognized from her research - the same pattern as the ocean currents that surrounded Lumaria.\n\"I understand now,\" she said, kneeling to touch one of the stones. It pulsed under her fingers like a heartbeat. \"The Division isn't a wall between worlds. It's a circulation system - like blood flowing through a body.\"\nMaris looked surprised. \"How did you know?\"\n\"Because I can feel it,\" Sophia answered. Through her Guardian senses, she could see energy flowing between the keystones, weak but still moving. \"It was never meant to separate worlds. It was meant to create balance between them.\"\nTharros crouched beside her. \"Then why did you try to destroy it, Maris?\"\nThe ancient Guardian lowered her eyes. \"I misunderstood its purpose. I thought it was keeping worlds apart when it was actually keeping them connected in the right way.\"\n\"The Leviathan,\" Arin said suddenly. \"It wasn't evil, was it?\"\n\"No,\" Maris admitted. \"It was the Division's protector before I corrupted it with my anger and fear.\"\nAs they spoke, Sophia noticed the keystones growing brighter. Through their bond, she could feel her mates noticing it too.\n\"They're responding to us,\" Kael said. \"To our bond.\"\nSophia stood, understanding flowing through her like the currents around them. \"The four of us together - we represent the balance the Division needs. Land and sea, magic and science, past and future.\"\n\"What do we do?\" Arin asked, her green magic swirling around her hands.\n\"We don't repair the Division,\" Sophia said with certainty. \"We heal it.\"\nActing on instinct, she placed her hand on the central keystone. It blazed with white light, and she felt a pull through their bond.\n\"Join me,\" she called to her mates.\nThey didn't hesitate. Tharros placed his large hand over hers, his gold dragon magic merging with her white Guardian light. Kael added his touch, silver warrior power strengthening the connection. Arin completed the circle, her emerald sea witch energy flowing into the mix.\nThe moment they all connected, a shock wave of energy burst from the keystones. The water around them began to glow with the same beautiful aurora they had seen when the Leviathan transformed.\n\"It's working,\" Maris whispered, watching in awe.\nThrough their bond, Sophia could feel something else - a presence in the water, curious and ancient.\nHello, she thought toward it.\nYou see me, came the reply, not in words but in feelings and images. After so long.\n\"The Leviathan,\" Sophia said aloud for the others. \"Not the monster it became, but what it was meant to be - a guardian of balance.\"\nIn her mind, she saw images of what the Division truly was - a complex system of magical currents that allowed energy to flow between worlds while keeping them distinct. The Leviathan had been its caretaker, not its destroyer.\n\"It was never meant to be controlled or used,\" she explained to the others. \"Just balanced and protected.\"\nMaris stepped forward, hesitation in every movement. \"Let me help,\" she said. \"Let me make amends for what I did.\"\nSophia nodded, and Maris added her hand to theirs on the keystone.\nThe ancient Guardian's knowledge flowed through their connection - centuries of wisdom about how the Division worked. With her guidance, they directed the combined magic of their bond through the keystones in the correct pattern.\nThe water around them began to pulse with color and light. The broken pieces of the temple lifted from the ocean floor, not reassembling but transforming into something new - a garden of crystal and coral that followed the same patterns as the Division itself.\n\"It's beautiful,\" Arin breathed, watching the transformation.\nThrough their bond, all four mates could feel the Leviathan's essence spreading through the Division, taking its rightful place as guardian once more. But it was different now - touched by their bond, infused with their combined magic.\n\"The Division is healing,\" Maris said, wonder in her voice. \"You've done what the original Guardians couldn't.\"\nAs the magic stabilized, they felt a deep rumble through the water. Not from the temple this time, but from the ocean floor itself. The sand shifted, revealing glowing lines that spread outward in all directions.\n\"What's happening now?\" Kael asked, his warrior senses on alert.\nMaris's eyes widened. \"Lumaria is awakening.\"\nThe lines of light grew brighter, connecting to form complex patterns across the ocean floor. Ancient structures began to rise from beneath the sand - not buildings, but living systems made of crystal and coral.\n\"What's Lumaria?\" Tharros asked, his dragon eyes tracking the changes with fascination.\n\"Not what,\" Maris corrected. \"Who. Lumaria is the first Guardian - the one who created the Division. Her consciousness has been sleeping beneath the ocean for millennia.\"\nAs she spoke, the patterns of light began to pulse in rhythm, like a massive heartbeat. Sophia could feel it resonating with their bond, with the Division, with the transformed Leviathan - all parts of a greater whole.\n\"She's awakening because she feels the Division healing,\" Sophia realized. \"She feels us.\"\nA voice surrounded them, not in words but in feelings that they all understood differently.\nAt last. Balance returns.\nThe voice felt ancient and wise, but also alive and curious. It touched each of them differently - Tharros felt recognition of his leadership, Kael sensed respect for his courage, Arin experienced acceptance of her magic, and Sophia received understanding of her bridge between worlds.\nBut before they could respond, the light patterns suddenly flickered. The voice faded, and the structures that had been rising sank partially back into the sand.\n\"Something's wrong,\" Maris said, alarm in her voice. \"Lumaria is struggling to awaken fully.\"\nThe keystones dimmed, their energy draining away.\n\"What's happening?\" Arin asked, trying to feed more of her magic into their connection.\nMaris's face paled. \"The Division is healed in this location, but there are other nodes around the world. Without them all active, Lumaria can't fully awaken.\"\nThe ground shook beneath them again as Lumaria's systems fought to stabilize.\n\"She's trying to tell us something,\" Sophia said, focusing on the fading voice.\nImages flashed through their bond - other temples, other keystones, scattered across the world's oceans. Seven in total, each guarding a critical node of the Division.\n\"We need to find the other temples,\" Sophia told her mates. \"This is just the beginning.\"\nAs the light faded from the ocean floor, leaving only the central pattern around them glowing, they felt Lumaria's presence retreat into slumber once more.\n\"She's waiting,\" Maris said. \"For all the temples to be healed.\"\nTheir bond hummed with new purpose as they looked at each other. The journey ahead would be long and dangerous, but they would face it together.\n\"Where do we start?\" Kael asked.\nBefore anyone could answer, a pulse of energy rippled through the water. In the distance, a new light began to glow - a beacon calling them forward.\n\"I think,\" Sophia said with a smile, \"we just got our answer.\"\nHeroes of the Deep\nThe journey back to Aquaria took three days. Sophia, her three mates, and Maris swam through waters that seemed brighter somehow, as if the ocean itself was celebrating their victory. They carried the rebalanced keystones in a net of magic woven by Arin and Maris together.\n\"Look!\" Kael pointed ahead where the first glowing spires of Aquaria rose from the sea floor. \"We're almost home.\"\nHome. The word felt right to Sophia now. Just weeks ago, she'd been a scientist on a research vessel, unaware of her true nature or the underwater world that would claim her heart.\nAs they approached the city gates, Sophia noticed something unusual. Crowds had gathered along the coral walls, their faces expectant. Word of their battle with the Leviathan had somehow reached Aquaria before them.\n\"They're waiting for us,\" Tharros said, surprise in his voice. The dragon king was used to respect, but the faces in the crowd showed something more - hope.\nArin swam closer to Sophia. \"Are you ready for this? You're about to become a legend.\"\nBefore Sophia could answer, trumpets made of giant seashells sounded from the towers. The gates swung open, and a procession of mer-guards in silver armor swam out to meet them.\n\"King Tharros,\" the lead guard said, bowing deeply. \"The Council awaits you and your mates in the Great Hall. News of your victory has brought joy to all of Aquaria.\"\nMaris hung back, uncertain. \"Perhaps I should not-\"\n\"You're coming with us,\" Sophia said firmly, taking the ancient Guardian's hand. \"Redemption starts now.\"\nThe five of them swam through Aquaria's streets, followed by cheering crowds. Children darted around them, their small tails flashing in colorful streaks. Some brave ones touched the glowing keystones, giggling when the stones pulsed with light in response.\nThe Great Hall of Aquaria was packed with representatives from every underwater species - mer-people with tails of every color, shark-folk with their intimidating teeth, gentle whale singers, and even a delegation of surface dwellers in special breathing suits.\nTharros took his place on the royal dais, but instead of sitting alone on his throne, he gestured for Sophia, Kael, and Arin to join him. Four thrones now stood where once there had been one.\n\"People of Aquaria,\" Tharros's voice boomed across the hall. \"We return with news of victory. The Leviathan is no more - or rather, it has been restored to its true purpose as guardian of the Division.\"\nWhispers swept through the crowd at this revelation. Sophia stepped forward, her Guardian light glowing softly around her.\n\"The Division was never meant to separate our worlds,\" she explained. \"It was created to maintain balance between them. For too long, we've misunderstood its purpose.\"\nShe gestured to the keystones floating beside them. \"These will be the foundation of a new system - a Guardian Council that will protect and maintain the balance.\"\nAn elder from the Shark Clan pushed forward. \"And who will lead this council? You, surface dweller?\"\nBefore Sophia could respond, Kael stepped beside her. The silver markings of his royal heritage now shone clearly on his skin for all to see.\n\"I am Prince Kael Stormwind of the Eastern Seas,\" he announced, his voice strong and clear. \"For years I hid my identity, believing leadership was a burden. Now I see it as an opportunity to forge new connections between all species of the sea - and the land.\"\nMurmurs of surprise rippled through the crowd. Many had suspected Kael's mysterious past, but few had guessed his royal blood.\n\"The Council will include representatives from all realms,\" Sophia continued. \"Land and sea alike.\"\nArin moved forward next, her sea witch magic swirling around her in emerald patterns. \"My tower, once closed to all but me, will now be a place of learning. Those who wish to understand the balance between light and dark magic will be welcome there.\"\nThe crowd's reaction was mixed - sea witches had long been viewed with suspicion. But Arin stood tall, her connection to her mates giving her confidence.\nFinally, Maris stepped forward, facing the crowd that had once revered her as a legend.\n\"I created the Leviathan from fear and misunderstanding,\" she admitted. \"Now I offer my knowledge to help rebuild what was broken.\"\nTharros rejoined his mates at the center of the dais. He took Sophia's hand, then Kael's, then Arin's, forming a circle of their bond for all to see.\n\"The prophecy spoke of hearts united,\" he said. \"Not just our four, but all hearts who seek balance and peace. This is the true meaning of our bond - not power for ourselves, but harmony for all.\"\nThe crowd erupted in cheers that shook the coral pillars of the Great Hall.\nLater that evening, as celebrations continued throughout Aquaria, the four mates slipped away to the sacred pools in the palace's inner sanctuary. The water there glowed with magic older than Aquaria itself.\n\"I've never seen the pools so bright,\" Tharros said as they approached.\nSophia knelt by the largest pool, touching her fingers to its surface. The water rippled, then formed images - visions of Aquaria flourishing, of new cities rising from the sea floor, of surface dwellers and sea folk working together to heal the oceans.\n\"The future looks promising,\" Kael said, his arm around Arin's waist.\n\"But first,\" Arin reminded them with a smile, \"we have a ceremony to complete.\"\nThough their bond had been forged in battle, the formal binding ceremony had been interrupted by the Leviathan's attack. Now, with peace restored, preparations could properly begin.\n\"Three days from now,\" Tharros declared, \"when the ocean currents align with the stars above. We'll complete what we started.\"\nSophia smiled at her three mates, feeling their love through their bond. \"I can't wait.\"\nAs they turned to leave the sacred pools, a final image appeared in the water - six points of light scattered across a map of Earth's oceans, pulsing in rhythm with each other.\n\"The other temples,\" Sophia whispered. \"They're calling to us.\"\nMaris appeared in the doorway, her face solemn. \"Lumaria stirs beneath the waves. The Division has begun to heal, but our work is far from done.\"\n\"After the ceremony,\" Kael said firmly. \"Some things can't wait.\"\nThey walked together from the sanctuary, minds filled with thoughts of both celebration and challenges ahead. Their bond had saved Aquaria, but greater tasks awaited.\nAs night fell over the underwater kingdom, lights glowed from every tower and home. Music drifted through the currents, and laughter echoed along the coral streets. For tonight, at least, all was well.\nIn her chamber that night, Sophia stood by the window overlooking the city, watching the celebrations below. A soft knock at her door revealed Tharros, Kael, and Arin, all smiling.\n\"We couldn't sleep,\" Tharros admitted.\n\"Too excited about the ceremony?\" Sophia asked.\nKael shook his head. \"Too worried about what comes after. The other temples won't be as easy as the first.\"\nArin touched the mark on her wrist - the symbol of their bond that had appeared during their battle with the Leviathan. \"Whatever comes, we face it together.\"\nAs they embraced, a tremor ran through the palace, subtle but unmistakable. The four mates exchanged worried glances.\n\"Did you feel that?\" Sophia asked.\nTharros nodded grimly. \"Lumaria grows impatient.\"\nOutside, the celebrations continued, unaware of the slight shake. But in the sacred pools, new images formed in the water - darkness gathering around the distant temples, forces already moving to stop what the four mates had started.\nTheir victory had begun a new chapter, but the story was far from over.\nDawn of Two Worlds\nSix months had passed since the battle with the Leviathan. Sophia stood on the balcony of her new laboratory in the highest tower of the coral palace, watching surface ships pass overhead. These weren't ordinary research vessels - they were part of the Aquarian-Human Alliance, the first official diplomatic connection between land and sea in thousands of years.\n\"Admiring your handiwork?\" Kael's voice came from behind her as he wrapped his arms around her waist.\nSophia smiled, leaning back against him. \"It still doesn't feel real sometimes.\"\nBelow them, Aquaria sparkled with renewed life. The city had grown since their victory, with new coral structures rising alongside ancient buildings. Surface technology blended seamlessly with ocean magic - waterproof tablets displaying ancient texts, magical currents powering human machinery.\n\"The delegation from the Pacific kingdoms arrives tomorrow,\" Kael said. \"They're eager to meet the famous four who united the worlds.\"\nSophia laughed. \"Famous four? Is that what they're calling us now?\"\n\"Better than 'the prophecy people,'\" Tharros said, joining them on the balcony. The dragon king wore ceremonial armor that caught the ocean light. His eyes, once cold and distant, now sparkled with warmth when he looked at his mates.\n\"Are you nervous about tomorrow?\" Sophia asked, taking his hand.\n\"A dragon king is never nervous,\" Tharros replied with mock seriousness before his face softened. \"But yes. This binding ceremony means more than our first attempt. The whole ocean will be watching.\"\n\"And part of the land,\" Arin added, appearing in a swirl of emerald magic. \"Your human friends arrive tonight.\"\nSophia's heart jumped with excitement. Dr. Chen and the research team from Genesis would be the first humans officially invited to witness an underwater royal ceremony. Her two worlds, finally meeting.\n\"Is everything ready at the gateway?\" she asked.\nArin nodded. \"Your old research facility has been fully converted. The magical barrier allows controlled passage now.\"\nWhat had once been a place of captivity for Tharros was now a bridge between worlds. Sophia had spent months teaching her human colleagues and Aquarian scholars to work together, translating science into magic and back again.\n\"We should rest,\" Kael suggested. \"Tomorrow will be a long day.\"\nBut as they turned to go inside, a messenger approached, swimming rapidly through the water.\n\"Your Majesties,\" the young mer-girl said, bowing hurriedly. \"There's a situation at the Western Gateway.\"\nTharros frowned. \"What kind of situation?\"\n\"A human vessel. Not one of ours. They've dropped some kind of device into the Division barrier.\"\nSophia exchanged worried glances with her mates. Not everyone on land had embraced the new alliance.\n\"Let's go,\" she said.\nThe Western Gateway was a shimmering wall of magic that separated Aquarian waters from the open ocean. Sophia and her mates arrived to find palace guards surrounding a metal sphere that pulsed with red light.\n\"Don't touch it,\" Sophia warned, swimming closer. \"It looks like a sonar device, but modified.\"\nArin waved her hands over the object, green magic flowing around it. \"It's trying to map the Division barriers.\"\n\"Someone's looking for weaknesses,\" Kael said grimly.\nTharros growled, air bubbles escaping his mouth. \"Always humans who-\"\n\"Not all humans,\" Sophia interrupted gently. \"Just like not all mer-people welcomed me at first.\"\nArin placed her hands on the device. \"I can disable it, but we should learn who sent it first.\"\nAs her magic flowed into the sphere, images appeared above it - a projection of a sleek black ship with no markings.\n\"Oceanic Research Institute,\" Sophia whispered.\n\"Your former employers?\" Kael asked.\nSophia nodded, her stomach tightening. \"But I never knew who really funded them.\"\nThe image shifted to show a man in an expensive suit, his face hidden in shadow.\n\"We need to secure all gateways,\" Tharros ordered the guards. \"Double the patrols.\"\n\"But the ceremony tomorrow-\" one guard began.\n\"Will proceed as planned,\" Sophia said firmly. \"We won't let fear drive us apart again.\"\nKael touched the mark on his wrist - the symbol of their bond. \"We've faced worse than corporate spies.\"\nArin finished her spell, and the device went dark. \"I've sent a little surprise back to their sensors. They'll be seeing nothing but kelp fields for weeks.\"\nSophia smiled despite her worry. \"Let's return to the palace. We have a ceremony to prepare for.\"\nThe Great Coral Cathedral was filled with light and music on the day of the binding ceremony. Representatives from all underwater kingdoms floated in the upper galleries. Human dignitaries, including Dr. Chen, watched in wonder from a special air-filled chamber.\nSophia wore a gown of living coral and pearls that moved with her as she swam to the center of the cathedral. Her three mates waited for her there, each dressed in ceremonial attire representing their heritage - Tharros in dragon-scale armor, Kael in royal mer-warrior regalia, and Arin in the flowing robes of a sea witch.\nThe High Priestess of Aquaria, a ancient mer-woman with silver hair that floated like a cloud around her, conducted the ceremony in both mer-language and English.\n\"Today we witness the fulfillment of the ancient prophecy,\" she announced. \"Four hearts united not just by fate, but by choice.\"",

On each of their wrists, the bond-mark transformed, adding new patterns that connected their four symbols into a single design.\n\"The bond is complete,\" the Priestess declared.\nCheers erupted from the gathered crowd, vibrating through the water. Even the human observers clapped their hands, their faces pressed against the glass of their chamber.\nBut as the celebration began, Sophia noticed something strange. The water near the cathedral's highest windows darkened momentarily, as if a shadow had passed overhead.\nArin noticed it too. \"Did you see-\"\nBefore she could finish, a tremor shook the cathedral, stronger than the one they had felt months ago. Coral decorations broke free from columns, floating away in the current.\nGuests looked around in confusion and fear.\n\"Just an underwater quake,\" Tharros announced calmly, though Sophia could feel his concern through their newly strengthened bond.\nThe festivities continued, but Sophia couldn't shake her unease. Through the cathedral's crystal ceiling, she spotted something moving in the distance - a massive shape, darker than the deepest trench.\n\"Kael,\" she whispered, pointing upward.\nHis eyes narrowed. \"That's not the Leviathan.\"\n\"No,\" Arin agreed, joining them. \"Something worse.\"\nTharros swam to them, his expression grave. \"The keystones are reacting.

Their victory six months ago hadn't been an ending - it had been just the beginning.\n\"The other temples,\" Sophia said. \"They're waking up.\"\nIn the waters high above Aquaria, the dark shape moved again, then vanished into deeper waters. A clear message: their time of peace was over.\n\"Tomorrow,\" Tharros said firmly. \"We'll deal with it tomorrow.\"\nSophia nodded, but felt a chill that had nothing to do with the water temperature. Through their bond, she sensed a new danger approaching - one that threatened not just Aquaria, but both worlds she loved.\nThe ceremony continued around them, joyful and bright, while far below the ocean floor, ancient chambers began to stir.",

        "content": "\"A wolfless outcast branded as Alpha Dean’s mate. A vengeful hybrid hungry for his throne. When their unholy alliance ignites, Lia must choose: embrace her hidden power to protect her son, or watch her world burn. Destiny collides with vengeance in a battle where love is the deadliest curse.\"\nLia's POV \n Being a single mother has never been a simple job but try being a wolfless single mother. Your life would become hell, especially if you lived in Attic City where the majority were werewolves and little witches who risk their lives every day to be amid wolves.\n Unfortunately for me, I was neither a wolf nor a witch, or maybe I had a wolf but it was a silent one, almost useless. \nI don't know how the witches found me or why they kept me but one thing I know is this: I owe the witches a favor one day and I must put on this bracket made of coral to protect myself and make them think I am human.\n I am currently sitting on the stool staring directly at my beautiful reflection as I dry my hair. After so much rejection I have been able to get a job at a restaurant on the outskirts of Attics where I currently live. \nI dedicate the weekdays to work and the weekends to my son. A knock interrupts my beauty section as Merlin, my son, walks inside carrying a sad face. \"Do you have to leave today?\" He asks his five-year-old voice lower than usual. \nHe hates it anytime I leave him, but I usually don't worry he is in safe hands. Benedicta, the oldest witch in Attic's coven, has decided to keep him under her protection. \nOne thing I know for sure is that witches don't go back in their words unless you harm their own. \nI smile, drop the hair dryer on the table, and turn to him, \"Yes dear, mummy has to work,\" I reply, holding his tender hands. \nHe shoves his free hands into his pocket, something he does whenever he is nervous. It makes me wonder if this was his father's reaction when I told him I was a virgin.\n I am sure he would have thought it was a stupid idea for a girl to give her virginity to someone she just met but I wanted to. I felt my life had no fun, no pleasure in it and sex would be a great pleasure. He eventually took it but disappeared before I woke up. \nExactly three weeks later, I found out that I was pregnant with Merlin. \n\"Can I follow you?\" he asks. He inhales deeply as if he is trying to form his words properly.\n \"It's creepy in here. There is no kid to play with and you are never around. I am surrounded by old women, mama,\" he explained softly with a hint of pleading. \nHe raises his head and stares at me with his honey brown eyes and my heart drops for a bit. I know how it is staying in the coven admits witches with no one around. I had grown up that same way too, and it has been fucking lonely.\n Therefore I understand his pain but I can't help it, the world outside is unsafe for us especially if they find out about his pitiful history. His grandparents were rogue, and his mother was roofless although the witches told me I had a wolf and it needed a strong event to awaken it. \nTo me, it was unbelievable for a rogue to give birth to a full wolf. I mean it has never happened and if there is one thing I have learnt from my life, it is that good things never happen to me.\n \"Please\" he pleaded again before facing the ground again. \n\"Look Merlin\" I begin even though I know I don't have any excuse to give \"Mummy has to work and you can't follow me but I promise to come more often. I will come at any chance I get and when I have enough money I will take you out of here. okay?\"I ask, my voice shaking. I was on the edge of breaking down. \n\"Promise?\"\n \"I promise\" I replied and hugged him. He wraps his little arms around my neck. I break free from the arms and begin to tickle him and his young innocent laughter fills the air. \nAfter a while, I drop him down and watch him leave the room. I wear my clothes quickly. Lexie would kill me if I was late to work.\n \"You said you don't remember the man you slept with?\"Benedict asks as she leans against the door. I shake my head\n \"No,\" I replied. When I first got pregnant with Merlin, Benedict did not care. I was in another country where only humans lived. Werewolfs had their school within their pack's territory. \n\"Are you sure?\" she asks with a cold voice. I rolled my eyes in frustration. She had been asking me this particular question since the day Merlin turned four. \n\"Yes. Why do you keep asking me this sort of question Bendeticta? Is there something I need to know?\" I ask my voice laced with concern. We had all concluded that he was human. After all, my wolf was silent. \nShe stared at me intensely for a while, her eyes narrowing into a split \" When Adeline beat him the other day he got angry and came to meet me to report what she did. I felt a strange feeling Lia,\" she said, allowing what she had just told me to sink into me. \n\"He has a wolf. An unusually strong one is the type that only the gene of the Alphas contains.\"\n I furrowed my brow for a while confused about her explanation before it dawned on me.\n\"Wait. You mean his father might be an alpha!?\" Surprise mixed with fear laced my voice. \nShe gave me a light nod and walked up to me, \"You must keep him safe Lia. An alpha Mateless heir is an abomination in Attics. They could kill both of you, especially if he is an enemy heir,\" she said I swallowed hard as I let her words sink into me.\n  \"It can't be. I mean I was in Miami. It is a land for only humans,\" I said in my voice, hoarse and weak with the realization that I might be the mother to an enemy heir and that we could be killed. \nThe worst shot was that I did not even remember his face or anything. I was too drunk. The only conversation I remembered was the one I had when we were about to have sex and the scenes were blurry. \n\"It's the earth, Lia. All creatures are allowed to live on it so be careful. The witches might not be able to save you,\" she said in a stern voice I nodded and watched her leave my room.\n \"Lia, are you not done!?\" Lexie's voice echoed around the house. \n\"I'm coming!\" I shouted and brushed whatever fear engulfed me. No one was going to take my son away from me.",

        "content": "Lia's POV\n I hate working in restaurants. Male wolves hungry to defile anyone weak usually filled it. My case was worse. I had no wolf. It meant I could not even fight them whenever they tried to take advantage of me. \n Thanks to Lexie and Adrian, they were always there to protect me.\n  When Lexie and I arrived, we found the restaurant already filled with customers. We passed through the back door to avoid questions from our boss. \n \"You are late,\" Adrian whispered, standing between the both of us as we dished out orders. \n \"We know but we are here now, so can you go back to your work while we mind our work?\" Lexie asked with a stern voice. She hated Adrian.\n  To her, he was just another wolf waiting for the right time to have his way with me and she had to protect me since I had a soft heart. What she did not know was that Adrian had a crush on her, but he kept it to himself, afraid of her rejection. \n \"That was harsh,\" I whispered to her immediately after he left. She heaved a sigh. \n \"I was not a harsh lie. He always is. around can't you see that he is no different from others? He wants to take advantage of you,\" she said, her voice laced with concern. I picked up the plate that contained a customer's order. \n \"Has it ever occurred to you that he might want you and not me?\" I said and walked past without waiting for another word. I looked at the order number and the people who sat at the table. \n I tightened my grip on the tray as I approached Dimitri and his friend. Dimitri raised his head and watched me coming.\n  \"Ah, here she comes,\" he told his friends. They followed his eyes.\n I tightened my grip the more my knuckles were already white from nervousness. \n \"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a wolf-less girl on the bed?\" \n Dimitri asked his friend as I set the plate down carefully.\n  \"I mean, imagine the pleasure you would get from fucking a girl without a wolf?\" he added with a dirty smirk. They all laughed. \n I raised my head to see Lexie staring at them with anger. I shook my head negatively, I could protect myself.\n  Damien watched me as I saw them. He sipped his wine.\n  \"No, you are mistaken. It's fucking a human. Sometimes I wonder why the moon goddess would decide to make someone without a wolf. It's a waste of time and space,\" Damien said with a hint of sarcasm. \n \"They are created to satisfy us,\" Damien answered.\n  \"What do you think, lia?\" I halted, trying to control whatever anger I was feeling. \n \"Satisfy us in bed. It would be a mark that you are not as useless as you seem,\" he said, and they started laughing.\n  I swallowed hard and poured the last wine into a glass, without thinking I poured the wine on its face, I took the remaining bottle and poured the whole content on him. \n \"Sick bastard!\" I muttered before leaving. \n They watched me surprised that I stood up for myself for the first time. \"You did a great job, lia. I'm proud\" Lexie said as she rushed to my side after dropping the empty tray.\n \"Don't you think the boss would fire me? I disgraced a customer in front of the others'' The boss already hated me for refusing to sleep with him. Imagine how he would feel if he found out that I did such a disgraceful thing\" I added amidst tiny sobs\n  \"Hey look at me\" she commanded softly. \n \"You don't have a wolf, it doesn't mean you are weak or you deserve all that they are doing to you. You should be proud of yourself. You stood up for yourself\" she said as she rubbed my shoulders. With time the sniffing stopped.\n  \"Anyways have you heard?\" she asked me with excitement, her face laced with joy. \n \"Heard what?\" \"The king is looking for his son's mate. Alpha Dean. He wants all the Mateless wolf to come to his place this Saturday\" she said and watched my face. \n \"And?\"I asked, knowing she was not done with her announcement.\n  \"And I want you to come with me.\" I shook my head negatively. I raised my brows with a sneer.\n \"I don't have a wolf Lia, I am wolf-less. What makes you think the moon goddess would bless the Alpha with a curse like me?''I asked.\n  \"Oh please, the moon goddess can decide to give you an Alpha since she took your wolf and besides you can come because of me there would be fun,\" she said softly giving me puppy eyes.\n  \"There would be games and wine, you know. We could get drunk and besides I can't leave you alone with them,\" she said referring to Dimitri and his friend and the other men who wanted to take advantage of me. I was touched by her concern.\nI wanted to go but It was a weekend and I was meant to spend it with Merlin , my son. And I could not tell her that I had a son. It was meant to remain a secret between me and the witches. \n \"I can't,\" I whispered slowly.\n  \"Please, for my sake,\" she added. I rolled my eyes and heaved a sigh.\n \"Okay fine. I would come.\" \n \"Thank you!\" She said, giving me a hug. I hugged her back and left. I walked towards the toilet and closed the door behind me. \nEverything this week was just so complicated, I promised my son that I would spend more time with him, I promised Lexie that I would go to one Alpha mating event with her and I was quite sure that I would lose my job immediately the boss found out what I did. \n I used the restroom and stood over the sink splashing water on my face. I looked in the mirror to see Dimitri standing behind me with a scowl.\n  \"What are you doing here?\" I asked turning to look at him. I tightened my hands around my trousers. Within a split second, my body was slammed flat against the wall, his hands tightened around my neck. \n \"Dim..itri leave me alone,\" I said amidst breath. Contrary to my request his hands tightened around me.\n  \"Now, let me make this clear. You are only alive because it is forbidden for a wolf to kill a fellow wolf and know this. You are weak. Useless. \" He growled his eyes already turning gold.\n Don't tell me I will be killed by Dimitri in the toilet.\n  \"The next time you try what you did. I will make you and whoever you love pay for it\" he said and leaned closer as he whispered. \n \"And contrary to what everyone thinks. I am sure you have a deep dark secret.\" My heart sank as my son's innocent face flashed before me. He drifted back and released me from his grip. I exhaled loudly.\n  \"Everyone has a secret,\" he said with a smirk and left. It took a while for me to stabilize my breath. I rearranged my clothes and went back to the restaurant. \n Immediately I entered and my gaze fell on Dave, my boss. \"Lia, you are fired immediately. Go home!\" He ordered in a dismissive tone.\n  My eyes met with Damien and I glared at him. He returned it with a smirk. These people were going to pay dearly for this.",

        "content": "Dean POV\n I sat on the chair opposite Lorenzo, playing chess. It has been my favorite game since childhood; I loved the tension that hung around trying to keep your king alive.\n Lorenzo stared at the board with split eyes and a furrowed brow. \"I won't be home tonight,\" he says as he moves his knight towards my side.\n Ordinarily, I would have called him a twat. That one action had made him lose his game.\n \"Why? We are meant to plan against the crescent pack. They attacked our workers last time if you can remember,\" I say and move my pawn to the middle side.\n He nods his head as he moves his knight forward. \"I remember, Dean, but my mate needs me. I haven't been able to spend quality time with her and she is not happy about it,\" he explained, his eyes still on the board.\n I roll my eyes in anger. Ever since Lorenzo found his mate, it has always been \"my mate this,\" \"Izzie said,\" \"wants this or that,\" and it was getting tiring. \n He found it hard to say no to her. Something I was not comfortable with. He was gradually becoming weak, and it was not good for me or the pack. After all, he was going to be my beta after my father died.\n \"Common man, tell her no. Give her some random excuse and then end it with a sorrowful emotional note. She will agree. They are women, after all,\" I said, trying to make him see reason with me. Something I knew would not work.\n He scoffed and leaned back into his chair to stare at me. \"She is not just any woman, Dean. She is my mate. I can't refuse her,\" he said and paused, taking a gulp of the glass of tequila that was by his side.\n \"You won't understand. You have never had a mate or decided to commit to a girl before,\" he added and drank the remaining wine.\n I rolled my eyes in anger. Why does everyone keep telling me that I need a mate? \n For me, the moon goddess knew how cruel men would be and decided to create a version of herself and plant some weakness into our hearts toward only one girl.\n She strangely had to decide who it was that was the only explanation one could give me. Especially with the rapid change in Enzo since he found a mate. He was no longer the tough guy who killed at sight.\n Imagine my surprise when we caught a traitor and wanted to kill him. I called Enzo to give him the most brutal death. Something he usually enjoyed only for him to give me an excuse that pissed the hell out of me. \"Lzzie does not like me coming home with bloodstains on my clothes,\" he said and left.\n If this was how weak mates made people be, then I sure as hell don't want a mate.\n \"Oh please! I am not going to have my mate. I can't become a weakling like you,\" I scoffed.\n He smiled lightly and stood up, walking towards me. \"Love is the greatest strength one can have,\" he said, tapping my shoulders and leaving.\n I did not bother asking him where he was going, as I was pretty sure it was to go and see Lzzie.\n \"Tell Linda I want her in my room now!\" I ordered. One guard left to inform Linda, my special whore.\n I liked her mentality a lot and if I wanted a mate, it would be someone like her, although not a whore.\n She understood me and acted accordingly. I give her protection. She gives me good sex anytime I need it.\n I walked into my room and locked the door behind me.\n She sat on the bed wearing only a pant and bra and a light robe that showed her inside.\n I dragged on my clothes, watching her as she stared seductively at me.\n Immediately, I was completely naked. I leaned forward, claiming her mouth in a kiss as my hands traveled down her hole. She moaned loudly as I shoved my hands deeper into her hole.\n \"Dean..\" She moaned messily just the way I liked it. A woman should not be able to control herself when I touch her.\n I felt a grip on my hand, making me stop. I looked at her list filled with eyes.\n \"Why did you stop me, Puttana?\" I growled.\n \"Promise me this will continue even after your mating ceremony,\" she said in a low whisper as her hands drew lines around my back.\n I furrowed my eyebrow. \"Mating ceremony?\"\n \"Yes,\" she replied as her hands traveled to my dick. \"She said, 'Your father is holding a mating ceremony for you.'\"\n \"What the hell,\" I muttered as I forcefully removed my fingers from her hole. She gasped, surprised at my action.\n How on earth would my father organize a mating ceremony for me without my consent?\n I quickly got dressed and made my way towards my father's chambers where he had been for the past month seriously sick.\n \"Father!\" I shouted immediately. I got to the room, and my veins threatened to burst with anger.\n \"How the hell would you organize a mating ceremony without letting me know?\" I asked, pacing around the room, trying so hard to pacify my anger.\n His maid helped him to sit upright. He waved his hands, and she left, leaving the room that was filled with the warmth of my range.\n \"Dean, you need it,\" came his croaked voice.\n \"Have I failed you in any way, father?\" I inquired, returning the spiteful glare.\n \"No.\"\n \"Ever since you fell, have I let any of our enemy attack and go scot-free?\" I asked again.\n \"No.\"\n \"Then why do I need a mate? I can rule the entire pack without a mate. Maybe it is that the moon goddess or whatever you call her does not want me to have a mate.\"\n A glint of anger flashed through his eyes. \"Now listen to me, Dean,\" he said in a stern voice.\n \"Firstly, do not address the moon goddess disrespectfully or she will get angry and strike us and you are soon going to be an alpha. You need a mate to be by your side. A mate is a symbol of your strength.\"\n I balled my hands into a fist and shoved it down my pocket. \"Oh, please spare me that. We both know I am feared amongst all the wolf packs. I don't need the presence of a woman to let the world know that I am power,\" I fervently argued.\n \"You are going to find your mate this weekend and you are going to get married to her as soon as possible and that is final,\" he said with finality.\n \"Fine! But know this, even though I find a mate, I will reject her immediately,\" I said with a sneer.\n \"You will do no such thing!\" He shouted and then coughed.\n I mockingly bowed my head. With a smile, I said to him, \"Be my guest.\"\n \"Dean!\" He shouted as I slammed the door behind me.\n Woe betides the girl whom the moon goddess would choose to be my mate, for she would wish she was never born.",

I watched as the houses flew past me in the cab.\nLexie had already fallen asleep in the car. We lived on the outskirts of Attics. It would take a long while to get to the place where the mating ceremony was going to be held.\nI was going there for just one reason; to get food for me and some sweet delicacies for my son since I no longer had a job. Thanks to Damien and his friends.\nBenedicta did not even know I was going to the mating ceremony. If she knew, she would have held me back or maybe cast a spell that would prevent me from passing the door.\nI could still hear Tristan's tears as I told him I was not going to spend the entire weekend with him. However, after promising him that I would spend Monday and Tuesday with him, he started to smile again.\nThe cab stopped us at the front of the building and I woke Lexie up as we made our way towards the mansion.\n\"I will tell you something Lia, if Alpha Dean does not become my mate, I will take his beta,\" she said enthusiastically as her eyes wandered around the mansion.\nI did not blame her, though. It was a beautiful sight to behold, screaming for money and power. It had this historical yet modern structure. A typical old money house with wonderful architectural windows. It had a water fountain in the middle. Three beautiful peacocks roamed around on the other side. They painted it fully gray with a touch of brown.\n\"I heard the Beta has a mate already,\" I notified her as we strolled inside, clinging to each other like inseparable twins.\n\"Whatever. There is also something called a second chance mate,\" she blurted out.\n\"They only happen when his first mate dies. Which is not going to happen\"\nShe halted, making me stop. \"Are you my friend?\" She asked, her arms folded across her chest.\n\"Yes!\" \n\"Good. Then be on my side, support me in my fantasy,\" she retorted.\nI nodded. She smiled and took my arms again.\n\"What will you do if you become his mate?\" I asked her, trying to light up her mood.\n\"Oh, Lia. I would be the happiest person in this world. Imagine me being our Luna. I would find a good job for you and make Damien pay,\" she said enthusiastically.\nI smiled, touched by her thought. I wonder how lonely I would have been if not for her.\n\"What will you do?\" she asked me. I am interrupting my thoughts.\n\"Me? Nothing. I mean, we both know it is not going to happen. Why hope for something you would never get?\" I replied to her.\nShe heaved a sigh, a sympathetic sigh. I smiled tightly as she squeezed my hands. I was already used to it...\nTo be pitied.\nWe entered inside and joined the other Girls waiting for him. Sooner than later, the royal member started joining us without Alpha Dean.\n\"I'm going to use the restroom,\" Lexie whispered, freeing herself from me before I could reply.\n\"Lexie!\" I whispered yell and followed the direction she went. I roamed around the place for a while, looking for the female restroom that Lexie went to use.\nOne of the doors creaked open. I entered the next open room, which looked like a library. A female came outside the room, adjusting her black gown. \"I hope nobody saw us,\" she asked, her voice tinged with concern.\n\"No, everyone is waiting outside for me to choose a mate. No one is around,\" Alpha Dean said, coming outside. He closed the door behind him and left. \nFor the first time in a long time, I thanked the moon goddess for making me wolfless. I imagined his reaction as if he had perceived my scent.\nAlpha Dean could kill me for knowing his secret. From what I had heard, he was ruthless. Makes me wonder why someone would want him for a mate.\nI waited for a while until everything was silent before I left. I could not risk being caught.\nI made my way towards the crowd, my eyes searching for Lexie.\n\"Hey, I have been looking for you,\" she whispered from behind me. I almost jumped at her sudden appearance.\n\"You scared me Lexie and I went away looking for you,\" I explained as she led me to the back.\n\"We would see everything from this angle.\" \n\"But it's also means you will be the last, last,\" I replied.\n\"It doesn't matter, and keep in mind that after I leave, you will also leave.\"\n\"But-\" I began.\n\"Don't bother giving me an excuse for you being wolfless. You will go!\" she yelled.\n\"Fine!\" I whispered in total acceptance.\nA comfortable silence existed between us for a while before the event started.\nDifferent girls, some from different parks, came to the event. He stood at the center rigid, emotionless, and watched as they walked around him.\nSome are trying to seduce him. The girls were gradually reducing and within a short period; it got to Lexie's turn.\n\"Wish me good luck,\" she said in a nervous whisper before leaving.\n\"Good luck,\" I said and turned to the comfort of my coral bracket. It was the only familiar thing that I had.\nLexie walked around slowly. Her eyes were hopeful. Still, he did not move. She returned to me teary-eyed.\n\"Hey it's going to be alright,\" I said, giving her a tight squeeze.\n\"It's okay. Not like I expected it to be me,\" she said, a mist of silent sobs.\n\"Now go!\" She ordered, resuming her stern voice.\nJeeze. I thought she was mourning her loss just now.\nI took in deep breaths, and looked at Lexie one last time. She gave me an assuring nod, and I left.\nWith full awareness, I walked around slowly and nonchalantly, understanding that I could never be the Alpha's mate. The next Lycan.\nThe circle was completed, and nothing happened. Smiled and turned to walk towards my seat.\n\"You skipped one part\" his lethal voice stopped me on my track.\nTruthfully, I escaped that part on my own. I did not want to disgust him like the others did.\n\"Sorry Alpha,\" I quickly apologized and touched him.\nMy body felt a weak sensation pass through me as his hands tightened around me.\nHe growled, \"mate\".\nThat was not what caught my attention. Rather, what caught my attention was the tattoo he had on his hands. The same tattoo Tristan's father had on his hands the night we met.\nMy memory might be blurry, but I sure as hell remembered this tattoo. My heart sank into the depths of my stomach.\nNo, it can't be him.\nHe stood up and closed the space between us, adrenaline rushed within me with the idea of being close to him in front of everyone. He used his two fingers to raise my jaw making me look at his yellow eyes.\n\"Why don't you have a scent?\" He asked sniffing around me.",

        "content": "Lia POV\n\"Why don't you have a scent?\" he asked, his voice filled with contempt and disgust.\nI remained silent, I knew I had never been lucky but why on earth would the moon goddess mate me to an Alpha?\nAlpha's brides are meant to be innocent, clean, and untouched. I was the opposite of the expectations for Luna. \nI have been touched and I had a child for a man who I did not know. Although he seemed to be bearing a similar tattoo to the father of my child it did not change anything.\nI gasped as he grabbed me by my jaw \"Answer me!\" He shouts and I feel everyone around me flinching. His eyes sparkled with anger.\n\"I don't have a wolf?\" I replied. He let go of my jaw with force. I glue my eyes to the ground to avoid everybody's eyes, particularly Lexie's own. I don't even know what her reaction will be.\nHe scoffed, \"Can the moon goddess be more cruel?\" He asks no one in particular to walk around me.\n\"Dean! She is your mate!\" His father shouted from his seat, his voice sounding croaked because of his age and I heard he had been sick.\nHe growled \"Oh please. I told you I did not need a mate and you forced me to find one only for me to discover that she decided to curse me with a woofless girl.\" he put his voice filled with venom.\nHe curses under his breath \"She doesn't even have a scent. Father. She has nothing. What's the use of mating me to someone close to a human? I am an Alpha, I can't and I will not accept her as my mate!\" He shouts pointing at me, his hands shaking with anger.\n\"You do not question the moon goddess. She gave her to you to protect her.\"\n\"Well, if I need to protect someone it should be someone who needs help not someone who is useless,\" he shouted, his voice cutting into my soul.\nHe was going to reject me. It wasn't new, I knew no one would want me but deep down within me I wanted my mate to accept me. To give me that comfortable warmth that is needed.\nHe turned back to me, his eyes glowing yellow. I closed my eyes trying as much as I could to numb the pain that would come from the rejection.\n\"I, Alpha Dean, reject you as my-\"\n\"You cannot reject her and you will not reject her.'' A sharp feminine voice came from behind us. I turned around to look at her. She was in her fifties and wore a black gown with her hair painted black and white. She wore a long necklace that reached below her breast made with coral beads, beads that were similar to my bracelet.\nShe was a witch.\nAlpha Dean furrowed his eyebrow, his eyes reduced to a split as he looked at her.\n\"She has a wolf. It's just locked within,'' she added, maintaining Alpha Dean's glare with square shoulders that screamed confidence.\nShe was a witch and she was confident about it. Witches were not allowed in this city.\n\"What do you mean Sabrina?\" Alpha Dean asked.\n\"She has a wolf and it has been locked. Accept her and we will be able to break the curse.\"\nHe stared at her for a while and then he had a smirk on his face before he burst into laughter.\n\"Is this a ploy from my father to lure me into accepting her?\"\n\"Believe me she-\"\n\" Believe you? You are a witch, your people hate wolves. You are alive today because my father spared you from them using you as a harvest and you think I should believe you?\"\nSabrina opened her mouth to explain but was cut short by Alpha Dean, \"Guard! Take her away!\" he shouted.\nTwo of his guards came to seize her. She put her hands in the air and walked up to me, leaning into my ears she whispered.\n\"Tell Benedicta I said be careful,\" she said and took a step backward, petting my shoulders.\n\"Remember you are our own,\" she said and walked away.\nAlpha Dean's voice drew me back from thought.\n\"I, Alpha Dean, reject you as my mate,\" he said, finally uttering the words he had been waiting to say.\nI inhaled sharply and looked at him. If I was to accept his rejection I should do it boldly after all he had not only rejected me but insulted me.\n\"I, Lia Pierce, accept your rejection,\" I replied, my voice sharp with pain.\nWithout wasting much time, I walked towards the door and left without waiting for Lexie. \nImmediately I was out of his mansion, I broke into tears. His rejection hurt me more than I expected, it was as if a part of me was being taken away.\nI boarded a cab and went straight to Benedict's house to meet my son.\nThe house was unusually quiet. Tristian was meant to be around playing somewhere or maybe he was asleep.\nI fastened my pace to his room and opened the door silently. He fell asleep on his bed. I heaved a sigh of relief. Thanks to the moon goddess.\nI entered the room to caress his innocent face. Immediately the air at the back of my neck stood, I could feel someone's piercing gaze or should I say glare.\n\"Having an illegitimate royalty is a big threat, you know. You could be killed\" A lethal voice spoke from the edge of the room where my back was facing.\nI turned around and my eyes met with the burning red eyes.\n\"What are you talking about?\"I asked, trying to hide the fear that was seething up my throat.\nHe waved his hands in the air, \"Don't play dumb. I know this is Dean's child!\"\n\"Well I, as his mother, is telling you that this is not Dean's child. His father is from Miami!\" I replied.\n\"You saw the tattoo Ava, don't lie. You know within you that that is Dean's child.\"\n\"What do you want, did Dean send you?\" I asked.\n\"No, I came on my own to offer you freedom. I would help you break your curse and in turn, you will go back to him or he will come looking for you and once you are inside you would destroy him for me,\" he replied with a grin.\n\"Who are you?\"I asked, my voice laced with suspicion.\nHe grinned wilder, \"That's for me to know and for you to dot.dot.dot,\" he said walking away.\n\"Think about it, the power of eventually becoming a Luna, which you will be given the fact that you are the mother to the heir.\" He said this time with a lethal voice.\n\"And note, I don't take no for an answer,\" he said and left.",

To them, they have done nothing, but the mere connection they have with Dean is enough.\nIn fact, I have promised myself that I would burn any connection that would make Dean happy.\nAfter soaking in the satisfaction that came from looking at Lia's blue eyes, I made my way back to Sabrina's house.\nMy hideout for the past years. I knock on the door for a while before she opens. She is dressed in her natural attire of a long flowing gown with a long coral bead necklace that touches below her breast.\nShe glared at me, while I returned her glare with a smile. Seriously, she needs to get used to the fact that I am not going to hide anymore. I killed a royal member, so what? One of them also killed my mate. I just decided to make it even.\nShe steps aside for me to enter inside and bangs the door immediately at her back. Ops, it seems someone is angry.\n\"I told you not to visit the palace yet. Do you want to get killed?\" She asked immediately, and I sank into her soft white couch.\nI rolled my eyes. \"I did not go to the palace. I went to see my cousin's mate and his wife. Is there anything wrong with that?\" I asked.\nShe rushed to me and gripped my chin, making me look at her with an amused smile. I think she really needs to cool off. No one is going to hurt me, be it the Alpha or his son, whose mystery I have made my personal assignments.\n\"Did I not tell you not to harm that child? Or his mother?\" She asked, her voice laced with anger.\nI remove her hands from my chin. \"Relax Sabrina. I did not, and I thought you were a witch; don't you have the ability to see what everyone is doing?\" I asked and stood up, walking to the kitchen to make coffee since she had banned me from taking alcohol.\n\"Yes, but I would rather waste my strength on something else than your mischief,\" she answered and walked up to me.\n\"Seriously, Luca, did you do anything that would make them suspect you? I have been hiding you from everyone, and just because I told you about your cousin mate, who has a child for him, you suddenly rush outside. Do you know what would happen if Dean got to you?\" she asks, worry laced in her voice.\nI scoff, \"Nothing, Sabrina. He can't do anything. Besides it, Dean, the king of cowards,\" I said.\n\"So how did it go? Did she confirm it?\" She asked.\n\"No, she did not need to. Her blue eyes said it all.\" I explain, remembering how intense her eyes were.\nI run my hands over my hair. I need to take my mind off those fearful eyes. She is Dean's mate and needs to be punished.\n\"I just told her to do as I say and everyone. Would be happy, but for now. I am going to my home, I say and stand up, but Sabrina follows me.\n\"Your what?\" she asked with concern dripping from her voice.\n\"My home. I need to tell my favorite uncle that I am alive,\" I say and walk out before she can say anything or for any of her spells.\nI enter my car and drive around the pack for a while, enjoining the attention that comes from being known as a bad person.\nSome of the pack members glare at me with anger while the girls blush as I wink at them. I make my way straight for the palace and enter the hall.\nSome years back, I was known as a rogue, and I was worthless. The only worth attached to me was that my father was the Alpha son thereby making me a prince.\nAfter the news of my abolishment, I got to find out everyone's true intention against means I have come to teach them a lesson.\nI knock on my uncle's door for a while before entering. He is lying on his bed reading a book; he drifts his eyes from the book to me.\nHe stares at me for a while, and for a moment my heart drops. It stops breathing. What if he still hates me? Although I knew I deserved his anger, I thought he would forgive me. So many years had passed since he punished me.\n\"Luca,\" he calls out in a shaky voice. His voice was soft with affection. My heart drops a bit; he loves me. He still loves me.\n\"Uncle,\" I reply, still standing. \nHe moves to sit up, which I help him to. He reached for my face with trembling hands.\n\"You are back! Where have you been?\" he asked. I can clearly tell that he missed me.\n\"I have been-\nOur conversation is interrupted by Dean, his son, and the Alpha. May he reign long after my death.\n\"Father! What is he doing here?\" He asks with disdain.\nHis father opens his mouth to say something but i interrupts.\n\"I came to see my uncle and to stay. I am back from my punishment,\" I say with a poker grin.\nHe curls his hands into a fist. \"Never! You can never live here,\" he commands as if he is expecting me to respect him.\nI swallow hard and walk towards him, my arms crossed against my chest. I stare at him in the eye, or rather, I stare down at him, given the fact that I am taller than him.\n\"I don't remember asking you for permission, Dean. I am here to stay here and don't make the mistake of thinking I miss this place. I only came here to fulfill one wish, and that is to watch you burn,\" I whisper into his ears and leave.",

A pang of guilt filled my heart as I wondered how people would mock and insult her.\nShe was a beautiful girl. Someone I would normally want to fuck, but not to keep as a wife.\nTo make matters worse, she was a rogue! Not a wolf or an omega, a fucking rogue!\nWhy did the moon goddess decide to be this wicked?\nAnyway, that's not my business. I should remove her from my head. The earlier I did, the better for me. I would not want to find myself thinking about some rogue girl. Who is nobody?\nMy father cleared his throat, disrupting my thoughts. I straightened my shoulders, ready for him to lash out at me, or maybe insult me.\nThat would not really bother me. After all, I warned him.\nHis nostrils flared as he glared at me. In return, I gave him my best smile.\nHe stood up to address the pack, maybe to tell them to continue with the ceremony or tell them they will soon have their Luna. A promise I knew would never come to pass, at least not now.\n\"Wolves of Attics Pack. As you all saw today. My son, Dean, has rejected the gift the goddess gave to him for a mate. With this rejection, I am beginning to feel unsure about his potential as the next Alpha.\"\nI furrowed my eyebrows as my muscles tensed. What was he trying to say?\nIs he trying to say I am not going to be a worthy alpha?\nNah, I shook the thought away from me. I am his only child, the most feared Alpha among the other alphas.\nI am a potential asset. He would not deny me of my throne because I rejected some rogue.\nI could hear murmuring among my wolves.\nHe looked at me and I returned it with a glare; he returned it with a smile. \"Therefore, I strip him of his position as the heir till he proves otherwise. Bear in mind that he might become the heir or Luca, his cousin, the rogue would become the Alpha.''\nI burst into laughter. He glared at me, but I kept on laughing.\n\"You really thought of all the ways to threaten me and you came up with the idea of making Luca the next Alpha. Serious?\" I inquired, my eyebrows raised as I glared at him.\n\"I can make anyone my heir.\"\n\"And the best option is Luca. The rogue? Have you forgotten what he did to us or should I reveal it to everyone?\" I asked, pointing at the crowd.\nThe council of elders furrowed their eyebrows. As they whispered to each other. Of course, they did not know what he did. They would have killed him if they knew.\n\"Dean!\" my father shouted, his hands rolled into a tight fist.\n\"Father!\" I shouted back.\nTo think that he for once considered making Luca the Alpha was a painful discovery.\nAnger was bottled up in my chest. I closed my eyes for a moment as I tried to control the anger that crept under my skin.\nAll this while, I have been a faithful son, a suitable heir. I have conquered more parks than he did when he was my age and then he just decided to blow everything up.\nWhy on earth should I feel surprised? He had never loved me, only seen me as an heir, someone to continue his throne.\nIt has always been Luca right from time.\nWhen I was young and made a mistake, he gave me punishment too much for my age, but whenever it was Luca, he would say \"he is just a kid\".\nA tap on my shoulders brought me back to reality, and I realized that all this while I had been glaring at my father.\nLorenzo came from my back and whispered into my ear \"Dean, let's get out of here\" he said, tapping my shoulders as he tried to calm me down.\nI glared at my father once more and walked away. Straight to my room, with Lorenzo following me at my back.\nImmediately we got to my room, I slammed the door so hard. In Fact, I was sure people outside would have heard.\n\"How dare he threaten me with Luca? Of all the wolves, Luca?\" I asked him even though I knew we both knew the answer, but still.\nHe took a bottle of Scotch and poured it into two empty glasses. He handed one to me.\n\"Drink.\"\nI took the glass from him and took it in one gulp and gave him to fill it again.\nHe watched me keenly for a while. I waited for him to speak up. Sometimes, it was hard for me to read him, especially when he wore a blank face.\n\"You have to apologize.\" \nMy eyes narrowed to him. \"To who?\" I asked with a raised eyebrow.\n\"To your father. Let him win this time or else he will give your place to Luca, we know that he can do it.\"\nI swallowed the Scotch in my glass, glaring at him with anger.\n\"Never!\" I growled.\nHe smacked his tongue against his teeth, \"The problem with you is that you never listen. Accept her and move on. She can become your Luna and nothing will happen except you want something to happen. '' he looked at me, allowing his words to sink in.\n\"You can even divorce her after your father's death. But now your priority should be being the Alpha and nothing else.\"\nWhatever he said was true. I can't sacrifice my throne for a girl. And I could divorce her after the wedding.\nI smiled at him. He smiled back with understanding. \nGosh, whoever gave beta's, I am very happy you gave me Lorenzo.\n\"Now go,\" he said.\nI smiled and went towards my father's chambers. I knocked at him and entered. He was pulling his crown.\n\"Have you changed your mind?\" He asked as he took off his watch and wore his slippers.\nI bowed my head and lowered my voice, trying to sound genuine. \"Yes, Father, I am sorry,\" I pleaded.\nHe turned to me with a smile. \"Good, that's my son,\" he said and walked up to me.\n\"Tomorrow, we will start the remaining ritual,\" he said. \"Okay, you will eventually fall in love with her. The moon goddess made it that way.\"\nI bowed to his height and let him kiss my forehead.\nA knock came in, without waiting for an answer. The person came in. My eyes widened in shock.\nLuca?\n\"Hi uncle,\" he greeted with a smile as he bowed toward him. My dad touched his head and raised him.\n\"You never said you were coming,\" he replied with a smile. His eyes glinted with happiness.\nI closed my eyes. I needed to leave this room right now.\nHe turned to me. \"Hi Dean, I heard you were holding a ceremony to find your mate, but when I came back, I was told you rejected her. May I ask why?\" he said, giving me a mocking smirk.\nI rolled my eyes. \"it's none of your business.\"\nHe scoffed, \"Of course, it is my business. Heard the girl you rejected is a rogue, just like me. You rejected your cousin's kind,\" he said, hitting me playfully on my chest. I glared at him.\n\"But don't worry, I am sure uncle will convince you as for now I have to go and settle something urgently,\" he said walking towards the door.\nI released a deep breath, happy he was going to leave me. He stopped at the door and turned back with a grin.\n\"Hope you missed me,\" he said and left.\nImmediately he left, and I turned towards my father.\n\"Did you invite him?\"\n\"No, he came on his own and cheered up,\" he replied, tapping my shoulders. \"He's your cousin.\"\nI removed his hands from my shoulders.\n\"Over my dead body will I accept him as my cousin!\" I said and left.",

The last time he came, he had given Merlin a terrifying sight. \nWhat will he do this time? Take him away, but he knew he was the Alpha's child so why was he still trying to kill him?\n\"Why does he keep threatening Merlin?\" I asked Benedicta.\nShe moved toward my bed and sat on it, placing her hands on the other side of the bed.\n\"Come and sit.\" \nI walked towards the bed and sat down. She gave my hands a little squeeze.\n\"Luca is Dean's cousin. He is called the ruthless rogue. They were best of cousins for a long time. Dean,  Lorenzo, and Luca were a perfect trio but then one morning. Dean's father sent him to his mother's park to be there and stay.\"\n\"Why,\" I ask. I mean whenever anyone commits a crime he is brought before the whole palace and the king recounts the crime the person committed.\nAnd then he orders his death. Sadly most of the people were witches and people from opposite packs who came to seek refuge.\nAnyway, Luca is his nephew he would not want any harm to come to him.\nBenedicta smiled at my inquisitiveness\"Well, it's simple. He must have committed an atrocity. I heard it was Dean who accuses him but we were never able to discover what the atrocity is. I wonder why he came back.\"\nI furrowed my eyebrows, \"Does the Alpha know about this?\"\nShe smiled with curved lips, \"I don't think so. Normally when someone tries to enter the park the Alpha will feel it and stop him and if it was someone he sent away they would bring him straight to the pack for cleansing and interrogation.\"\n\"So you are trying to say that he has his motives for coming?\"\n\"Yes, according to the prophecy Sabrina had. He will come back for revenge and he will destroy everything precious to Dean.\" she paused for a while to let her explanation sink in through me. Then she added.\n\"And that includes you and your son,\" she said and gave my hands a light squeeze. I knew she was trying to comfort me but it was not working.\nMy skin was going pale.\n\"Lia?\" she called\n\"Yes,\" I replied with a trembling voice. I was afraid that whatever she was about to say would confirm my worst fear.\n\"Pack your things we need to leave,\" she said, confirming my fears.\nI withdrew my hands from her. All my life I had been in the Attics park. All the memories, the good and the bad were here.\nNot to mention Lexie who was my best friend.\nMerlin has just started having friends it would break his heart to live here. It would be like we were starting again.\n\"But if someone leaves the park Dean's father would feel it. They will think we were trying to run away and worse. We cannot let them discover who you are,\" I said trying to make her see reason with me as to why we can't leave.\nShe smiled and placed her warm palm on the side of my cheek, \"Don't worry, I am fine and we will be fine. I can do some spell that would make us pass with ease but what I cannot do is bring back Merlin from the dead if he is killed.\"\nHer words finally brought in the fear I was withholding for a while. I imagined Luca pulling the trigger at my son or doing something worse. \nI tried to wave off the images that formed through my head. Images that would mean death for me. Imagine Benedicta handing Merlin's ashes to me.\nI dashed outside running to call Merlin. \n\"Merlin!\" I shouted, or I think I screamed.\n\"Yes mummy!\" he answered from the corner and ran towards me with his small hands filled with sand.\nI opened his palm and removed the sand.\"Come inside,\" I ordered.\n\"But I want to stay with my friend,\" he replied with a pleading tone.\nI shot him a razor-bade glare, \"Merlin, don't make me repeat myself\". \nHe bent his head and let go of the sand on his palm. It broke my heart to see him like this but there was nothing I could do.\nHe walked inside and watched me as I packed our clothes.\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked with an angry pout.\"We are leaving\" I replied as I arranged the clothes and the few ones we had.\n\"Leaving this place,\" he asked.\n\"Yes,\" I replied without glancing at him.\nI expected him to frown but to my greatest surprise, he smiled.\nHis voice lit up with excitement as he asked, \"Does it mean I will stay with you?\"\nMy heart dropped. That means he was always missing me. He was ready to leave everything to stay with me.\n\"No, we are leaving the city.\"\nThe smile on his face dropped once.\n\"But why?\"\nI bent down towards him and cupped his face as I tried to hide the tears within mine.\"We don't have a choice dear. Remember that man who held a gun to your head?\" I asked.\nHe nodded slowly\"Yes. He had golden eyes.\"\nI smiled sadly, \"Well he wants to kill us and we have to run,\" I told him even though I knew he did not understand what I just said.\n\"I don't want to die,\" he mumbled.\nI engulfed him in a hug \"You won't die okay? I would not let that happen. So just bring out your favorite toys and we will leave.\"\nHe nodded against my head. \"When do we leave?\" he asked.\n\"Tonight. In the dark.\"\nHe nodded and started bringing out his toys and handing them over to me.\n\"Are we going to tell Dad before we go\"? he asked as he gave me his black toy car.\nI shrugged \"He will find us.\"\nHe turned around and gave me the last toy \"What about Aunt Lexie?\"\nI stopped right on track. How would Lexie feel if I left her without even saying goodbye?\nIt would be the worst betrayal. I would give her a text message.\n\"I would tell her.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nBenedicta came in and gave us a necklace to put on. It was made of sea stones.\nShe gave Merlin toasted bread and tea. We watched as he drank it happily.\nImmediately Merlin was done eating. We packed our things and made our way for the woods.\nWith Sabrina's necklace, we were immune to anything.\nAs we made our way towards the border, the hair at the back of my neck stood as I felt someone's piercing gaze at me.\nI tried to shake the feeling off. I carried Merlin on my shoulders and clung to him as if my life depended on it.\nSomething moved in a flash around us.\nI saw it and stopped. Benedicta stopped too as she sensed it.\nIt happened again. The wolf or creature ran at speed again.\nBenedicta looked at me with fear in my eyes.\n\"Run!\" She shouted.\nIt ran again and stood in front of us.\n\"I wouldn't do that if I were you,\" the person replied with a smirk.\nMerlin clung closer to me at his voice.\nIt was Luca.

Laughed and laughed.\n\"Before you kill me, I would have snapped your neck, Benedicta.\" He said, his eyes reduced to a split as he watched her keenly.\nWithin a split second, he snatched the white oak from her and threw it far into the woods.\nHe dusted his hands as he walked towards me.\" I mean no harm.

They were all out in black clothes. Two females one male. \nI quickly recognized one of the females. It was Sabrina. The witch from the palace.\n\"Greeting my fellow witches,\" Benedicta said bowing her head slightly.\nI could tell that they were older than her.\nThey nodded. I looked at Luca begging him with my eyes for an explanation.\n\" They are here to do a ritual that would unlock your wolf. We would know if you are a rogue or an omega or you have a wolf.\"\nI held the helm of my gown to myself, afraid of how brutal the ritual was going to go.\nLuca took my hands and pressed them softly, \"Everything is going to be fine,\" he reassured me.\nWe stared at each other for a while before he left me.\nSabrina poured water on me.\n\"For this ritual, we will be needing the blood of an Alpha or the blood of a royal member.\"\nWere on earth they going to find the blood of an Alpha?\nLuca stretched forth his hands, \"Take my blood.\"\nSabrina gave him a cold look. She took the bowl and slit Luca's wrist and watched as the blood rushed.\nShe slit apart from Merlin's hand spread her hands and did some spell the cut quickly healed.\nThey stretched forth their hands towards the bowl and began to do some incarnation.\nBenedicta joined them too.\nI looked at Luca to find him staring at me. Something about his eyes made me uncomfortable. \nHis stare made me aware of my surroundings and suddenly the gown I was wearing felt too long. I wanted to lose my hair. To show him that I am beautiful.\nI snapped out of the thoughts as Sabrina walked towards me. She took a transparent mirror and aimed it at the sky. \nThere was a moon but it was not a full moon. She directed it towards the bowl and slowly, the bowl began to boil.\nThen she handed it over to me and made me drink it.\nMy body began to shake, and my joints broke into shapes as I watched myself turn into a wolf. \nThey watched me with keen eyes. Benedicta and Sabrina smiled.\nI was a wolf a full one. Not a rogue, not an omega.\nI slowly turned back into myself but I was naked, only left with pants and a bra.\nThey watched me, no one even bothered to give me a robe.\nSabrina spoke \"You must one day repay us for the kindness we have shown you. You will teach Merlin that magic is a blessing. So that one day when he is an Alpha he would allow us to come back to our land.\nShe said and they left. Entering into the thin air which they came from.\nLuca walked up to me with a blue bathrobe. It had his scent.\nHe whispered in my ear \"You look too sexy for a Luna\" I shot him a glare and he returned it with a smile\n\"So you should return to your home. The Alpha might have sent someone to look for you.\"\n\"But he rejected me.\"\nHe smiled with pride, \"And I told him, he will accept you.\"\nHe said and walked up to me he pecked me on my cheek \"Good night, Lia.\" He said and left the same mysterious way he came.\nI and Sabrina ran home and settled in.\nIn no time we heard a knock on the door. I opened it only to find Luca staring at me with a creepy smile.\n\"I want to tell you that you have a nice scent. One I will never forget.\"\nSomehow the thought of him never forgetting my scent warmed me up.",

        "content": "Lia's POV\nAfter Luca left I followed Benedicta and started arranging my things. Merlin was already fast asleep.\nWe had to arrange everything before anyone suspected we tried to escape.\n\"I can't believe you now have a wolf. I am so happy!\" Benedicta said smiling with happiness.\n\"Yes, but what about what Luca told me?\" I asked arranging my shoe rack.\nShe dropped whatever she was doing and rushed to me, her eyebrows furrowed deeply, \"What did he say? Did he threaten you?\" \n\"No. He said Dean would come back to make me his Luna. Do you think that will be possible? Because he just rejected me.\"\nShe heaved a sigh and sat down on the chair.\n\"Well, it might be his father who is forcing him to marry you. But don't worry it will be okay. If you are thinking about Merlin I would take good care of him. After all, you have Luca-\"\nShe added, \"You have Luca with a smile.\"\nI stopped what I was doing I  looked at her with a raised eyebrow and glared at her. \n\"Benedicta, what do you mean?\" \nShe shrugged with a smile, \"Oh don't act so innocent. I saw the way he was looking at you.\"\nI knew that whatever she was saying was true. I still felt his burning gaze anytime I thought about it. My skin still shivered at the thought of his blue eyes.\nBut nothing can happen between us. After all, he was Dean's cousin and he had threatened me before with my child life.\nFor all I know I might be a game to him.\n\"You warned me of him, Benedicta. Let's not forget the fact that he threatened Merlin's life.\" I said and added.\n\"He is Dean's cousin. Nothing can happen between us.\" I said and continued arranging my clothes.\n\"Oh please. It's Luca. The king of rogues. If he wants someone he gets it. He is the only one Dean fears.\"\n\"I thought you said he hated him.\"\n\"Yes but-\"\nA knock on the door interrupted us. Benedicta quickly hid our unarranged clothes and went to answer the door.\nThey were the palace guards.\n\"Is this where Lia lives?\" he asked.\n\"Yes,\" Benedicta replied and stood aside for me to answer them.\n\"The Alpha has requested for your presence tomorrow.\"\nI leaned against the door frame with my hands crossed around my chest, \"Why?\" \n\"You do not question the Alpha.\" he retorted.\n\"Mummy?\" Merlin called from inside the room.\nMy heart dropped at once. Benedicta rushed towards him to answer me.\n\"Is that your son?\" one of the guards asked.\n\"No, it's Benedicta's sister's own,\" I answered.\nHe glared at me, glancing all over my body as if to find some proof.\n\"Nine tomorrow morning,\" he said and left.\nI watched them disappear into the night darkness before I shut the door.\nI heaved a sigh. I was nearly caught. No one can know about Merlin at least for now.\nDean will not accept him since he does not remember what happened between us and Luca's intention was still uncertain.\n\"More people are getting to know about Merlin. We need to take him out of here since they know the place.\" Benedicta said drawing me from my thoughts.\n\"You can take him to Lexie's place,\" she said with finality in her voice.\nThe next morning\nAs early as six o'clock I was already on my way to Lexie's house. I knocked fervently at her door.\n\"Who is that?\" She asked as she unlocked her door lock.\nShe stared at me with sleepy eyes, \"What happened lia you-\" I rushed inside cutting her short before anyone would see me.\nShe locked the door and followed me from behind.\n\"Lia, what is it? Is he okay?\" she asked as I laid Merlin on the bed.\nI clasped my palms together and apologized. \"I'm sorry that I have not called you since the party.\"\nShe nodded and took my hands, \"I understand. It's okay, but why are you here this morning?\"\n\"I came to drop Merlin here. Please take good care of him. I have to go to the palace. The guards came to look for me yesterday night and almost saw Merlin. I don't want anyone to know about him yet. Lexie please.\" I begged.\n\"Fine, but do you know why they came to look for you?\" She asked as she brought out a blanket to cover him.\n\"No, but I will find out. Thank you.\"\n\"No problem. Just be careful. Okay?\"\nI smiled, \"Okay,\" I said and left her house.\nThe palace\nI sucked in a deep breath as I walked into the palace. The guards immediately opened the door for me without asking.\nI sucked in my breath as I tried to control the emotions that flooded me.\nThe last time I was here I was humiliated but it was different, last time I had no wolf.\nThis time I had a wolf. \n\"Yes, we are together,\" Lzzie my wolf growled within me. I smiled.\nI was led into the Alpha's presence.\nHe walked up to me smiling as if he had known me before. \"Lia, he said with a smile. Welcome,\" he said and opened his arm to a warm embrace. I hugged him back.\n\"Go and call Dean tell him Lia is here,\" he said he ordered one of the guards.\nDean came back a few minutes late, entering inside with a stoic face. He spared a glare at me before turning to his father.\n\"You called me?\"\n\"Yes, take Lia your mate to her quarters. We will do the relating ceremony tomorrow,\" his father ordered.\nHe glared at me, \"She can help herself,\" he said and walked back without sparing me a glance.\nLuca came in with his usual smile.\n\"Hello, love. Can I help you?\" he said lifting my bags.\nEverybody watched with keen attention. It's as if they hardly saw this side of him.\nI followed him and left the palace.\n\"Welcome to the lion's den,\" he said as he opened a door for me.",

He looked at me with disdainful eyes.\nAnd the Alpha had just ordered my marriage with Dean and he could not even look me in the eye.\nThe only person who acted nice to me was Luca and I was not even sure of his intentions.\nHe had threatened my son's life and had still gone ahead to become close to me. He was so nice to me and made his gaze so intense that it made heat erupt my whole body.\nI shook my head at whatever feeling I was having. He was my husband-to-be cousin and enemy for all I know he could be using me as a pawn in his game.\nA knock on the door interrupted my thought. I sat upright and straightened my shoulders.\nA fair lady walked inside and greeted me, \"Good evening my lady. I am Maguse, your new maid,\" she said beaming with a smile.\nMaid? I have not even gotten married and I already had a maid?\nI smiled back at her, \"I am Lia.\" I replied.\nShe nodded, \"I am always at your service. Do you need anything?\" She asked.\n\"Not yet, but I will tell you,\" I said.\nHer eyes wandered around the room and landed on my bag of clothes, \"I can help you arrange your clothes, while you can ask me any questions.\"\nI looked at her and then at my clothes. She seems to like me. I shrugged and nodded, \"Yes. Sure.\" I said.\nShe immediately opened the bag and started arranging my clothes.\nI lay on my bed. I took out my phone to text Lexie.\n\"I am to get married to the Alpha tomorrow. Please don't let anyone know about Merlin. The Alpha presently hates me,\" I texted.\n\"Sure. I will do it. We played a game today. He has already fallen asleep but I did not want to wake him up,\" she replied.\n\"Thank you for being a good friend,\" I texted back.\n\"Nahh you are the best,\" she replied feeling touched. \nShe had always been a good friend. I don't know what I would have done without her.\n\"Are you going to come down for dinner or should I send your food,\" she asked interrupting my thoughts.\nI nodded. \"Yes, bring my food here.\" Besides Dean does not even like me. After a few minutes, she came back with my food and placed it on the table. She nodded and left.\nA few minutes later someone knocked on the door.\n\"Come in,\" I ordered.\nLuca breezed In as if he owned the room.\n\"I see you are already avoiding your husband,\" he said with a grin.\nI rolled my eyes and focused on my food. The room suddenly became too hot, his intoxicating scent filled the air.\n\"I love my personal space,\" I replied with my attention still on my food.\nHe took two steps closer, his scent becoming more intoxicating. How could I have such a strange feeling for him?\nGosh! I need this mating ceremony to happen fast before I commit an atrocity.\n\"So it means I am interrupting your personal space.\"\n\"Yes\".\n\" It did not seem like that in the forest,\" he said.\nMy skin flushed at the thought of what transpired last night. I closed my eyes as I remembered how his musky breath intoxicated me.\nHe moved closer. His hands touched my jaw as he attempted to make me look at him.\nI dodged. I can't look at him. I was afraid that I would lose myself in his eyes.\n\"Lia look at me,\" he said with a low pleading voice.\nI took in shaky breaths and looked at him.\n\"My room is next to yours. The palace is not the way you seem it to be. So many people want you dead. If you need anything call me,\" he said.\n\"Why?\"\n\"What?\" He asked his eyebrows farrowed.\n\"Why should I trust you? You also want me dead.\"\nHis eyes darkened as he swallowed hard.\n\"You think I want you dead?\" He asked disbelief laced his voice.\nI shrugged, \"Yes, after all, you threatened me.\"\nHe scoffed as his jaw tightened.\n\"I made you get back your wolf. I would have killed you. That was my intention but not anymore,\" he supplied his gaze burned into my soul.\n\"If there is anyone who wants your safety. It is me\" he added and took a step back and somehow, the space took something away from me.\nHis gaze was still on me. He opened the door and came back with a bag.\nHe placed it on my bed. \"These are your wedding clothes.\"\nI furrowed my eyebrows. Dean was meant to be the one who sent me my clothes.\nI stood up from my table and walked towards the bed.\n\"Did Dean send you?\"?\nHe shook his head, \"Dean can never order me,\" he said and opened the bag.\n\"Red suit you. I bought the dress for you because. You don't get it. Dean hates you. He will not waste his time.\"\n\"What if he does?\"\nHe shook his head with pity. As if he was secretly mocking my hope.\n\"You wear the one you chose but if he does not put on min,\" he said and walked towards me.\nI stood transfigured on the ground. His height hovering around me.\nHe moved a strand of my hair behind my ears. His eye moved to my lips as it darkened.\nHe took hold of my hands and I shivered at his touch.\nHe removed his eyes from me and pecked my head.\n\"Good night sister-in-law,\" he said and turned to leave.\nI took in and exhaled a shaky breath as I tried to steady myself at the effects of his space.",

How come she has now?\nAnd why did she look more beautiful as if her wolf enhanced her beauty?\nI needed to shake off any thought about her. I am marrying her to please my father so that he would make me the next of kin.\nOnce, he makes me the Alpha I would wait till he dies, then I'll divorce her.\nBut I didn't think that was possible because the last time I rejected her it broke me.\nHer face kept reappearing in my head. To make matters worse Luca was always friendly towards her.\nI knew Luca. He would never do something if he was not going to benefit from him.\nI closed my eyes to sleep as fear crept into me.\nAnytime I closed my eyes, I always saw myself having sex with a girl. Then I will see a little boy who looks exactly like me.\nThe baby's face was always clear but the woman's face was not clear.\nNo matter how hard I tried, it remained blurry.\n\"Ahh,\" a loud female piercing voice interrupted my sleep.\nI sprang up immediately and made my way downstairs in haste.\nI met Lorenzo on the way. \"Do you know where that noise came from?\" I asked.\nHe shook his head in a hurry. \"I think it came from Lia's room,\" he said.\nImmediately I heard Lia. I rushed downstairs without thinking. My heart fell down my chest.\nI shouldn't be feeling this way because I hate her but she was under my custody. \nI switched on the whole light. Lorenzo ran behind me.\nI stopped when I got to her corridor. A lady was lying on the ground in a pool of blood.\nI stood transfigured, It can't be her. But she had the same hair and wore a nightwear that someone like her would wear.\nPlain but beautiful.\"Let's go!'Lorenzo shouted, drawing me from my thoughts.\nWe quickened our step till we got to her door. The person lauded her body and stabbed her. A knife was by the side.\nIt was organized. Her maid. I tried to open the door but it was locked.\n\"Please don't hurt me. Please\" she pleaded.\nShe was in danger, so we had to move and break the door.\nWithout thinking twice, I pushed the door, using my full weight against it.\nOne!\nTwo!\nThree！\nI hit the door and it opened. We rushed inside, and the intruder immediately jumped through her window.\nI rushed toward her and glanced through her whole trembling body.\n\"Are you okay?\" I asked concern laced in my voice.\nShe nodded even though it was clear that she was not okay.\nShe took in shaky breaths and steadied herself.\n\"I am fine,\" she said with a shrug.\nLuca burst in immediately, breathing hard.\nShe raised her eyes and it met Luca.\nShe immediately ran to him and engulfed him in a tight hug.\nLuca's eyes widened for a while before he wrapped his arms around her.\n\"Are you okay?\" He asked with pure concern.\nI have never seen him this concerned about someone.\nI looked at Lorenzo, and he raised his eyebrow at me.\n\"I'm fine. I called you. Where did you go?\" she asked, still hugging him tightly.\nMy heart dropped at the site. Anger surged through me.\nShe was meant to be my wife. To hug me instead and not him.\n\"I went to see you,\" he said.\nShe immediately pulled from the hug, her face laced with concern.\n\"Do you mean Mer? Like Mer?\" She asked.\nHe nodded, \"Yes.\"\nHer breathing increased, \"Is he okay? Is he already?\"\n\"Yes I took care of it, Mer will be fine,\"  he said with a smile.\nI cleared my throat \"And who is Mer?\" I asked.\n\"Nobody!\" They both chorused at once.\nI lowered my eyebrow and reduced my eyes to a split. They were obviously hiding something.\nI would make sure I have guards follow them.\n\"Lia, go to bed. I will send the guards down.\" I ordered.\nShe stood in the same position. She looked at Luca and he nodded.\n\"I will be around,\" he said.\nShe made her way towards the bed. \"I need to sleep,\" she said, stating that she wanted us to leave her.\nWe nodded and left. Immediately we were outside. I pushed Luca to the wall. As I tried to control the anger in me.\n\"What the hell do you think you are doing?\" I growled.\nHe smiled, \"What do you mean?\" He asked feigning ignorance.\n\"Trying to impress my mate.\"\nHe laughed, \"Point of correction she is no longer your mate, not at least till tomorrow. Besides we are just friends.\"\nI watched him with a glare from the hollow of his toes to his head.\n\"I will make you drown in your blood if you try anything funny with her,\" I warned, venom-filled my voice.\nHis grin grew wilder. \"Do I sense jealousy?\" He asked.\nI scoffed and stepped backward. I did not know what got over me that made me so protective of her.\nOr so jealous of what she and Luca had. In Fact, I would not call it jealousy, I am trying to protect my wife.\n\"Lia is a beautiful girl. I would never hurt her but you?\" He said pointing at my chest.\n\"I would hunt you down and make you pay for what you did.\"\nWe glared at each other. Our eyes beamed with raw range.\n\"if you try anything stupid I will kill you.\"\n\"You saw your wife's reaction just now. If you hurt me she might just kill you,\" he warned.\nMy jaw thickened. He was trying to use Lia to get to me.\nI glanced at him once again and walked away. Lorenzo followed me at the back.\n\"We need to end whatever is going on between them,\" he said as we climbed the stairs.\nI nodded in agreement. \nShe was my wife and mine alone.",

Hope Lexie was okay.\nAt four o'clock I stood up and started pacing around the room. Once it was five o'clock I would go to Lexie's house.\nConfused thoughts ran through me. Merlin has never been attacked. Up until now, I had succeeded in keeping Merlin a secret from everyone.\nNo one knew about him. So how come the first night I spent in the palace, they attacked him.\nIt only meant someone knew about Merlin's father. The only person who knew about it was Luca.\nCould Luca be the one who tried to hurt him? I mean how did he know he was about to be attacked?\nNo. Luca would never want to hurt me.\n\"He might not want to hurt you but remember he is Dean's enemy. His anger might hurt Merlin,\" my wolf said.\nThis was the first time she was talking to me since the night they unlocked her. \nI smiled with courage, I now had someone to be around me.\n\"Who do you think it might be?\" I asked my wolf.\n\"I don't know,\" she replied in a sad voice. Obviously, she was sad that my child was in danger.\n\"I think Dean is suspicious of you and Luca after the affection you showed his cousin,\" she added.\nI knew it was going to make us seem suspicious but I could not control my emotions yesterday. Luca was the only one I felt comfortable around.\nImmediately it was 5 o'clock and I wore my dress. A pair of trousers and a white shirt left my room and walked towards the gate.\nThe guards stood in front of the gate with a stoic face. Their overly body-built body hovered over me as they tried to intimidate me.\n\"Move out of my way. I need to see someone.\" I said with a frown.\n\"The Alpha has insisted one of us follow you if you are going out,\" he said.\nI scoffed, Dean can't be serious. I knew he was doing it because of what happened yesterday.\nHe was trying to find out whatever we were hiding.\nCoward! He will never know anything about me and my loved ones after all he hated me.\nI crossed my arms over my chest \"I don't want to go with a guard I can go on my own.\"\nThey remained in the same position as one of them spoke, \"Then I am afraid we can't allow you.\" \nI tried to push them away but they did not flinch. \nAhhh! I hated Alpha Dean with my life. I needed to see Merlin even though today was my wedding day.\nI glared at them for the last time and made my way inside blind with rage and fear when I bumped into a hard chest.\nI looked up with relief, it was Luca.\nHe raised his eyebrows as he asked \"Are you going somewhere?\"\nI nodded, \"I was but your annoying Cousin told his guards to make sure I don't leave this palace without them.\" I said.\n\"Is it about Mer?\" He asked.\nI nodded with a smile. I like the fact that he gave Merlin a nickname.\n\"I want to see if he is fine,\" I added with a low pleading voice.\nHe stared at me for a while and heaved a sigh.\nHe took hold of my hands and we went to his car. He opened the door for me and I entered. I beamed with a smile at him.\nThe guard remained standing at the front of the gate.\nThe guard stood by the gate, \"You can't take her with you,\" he said.\n\"On whose orders?\" He asked his voice deep with anger.\n\"Alpha Dean,\" he said.\nLuca took in deep breaths and looked at me \"Whatever you do. Don't panic and know that I will never hurt you,\" he said.\nI nodded wondering what he was going to do. \n\"Open the gates or I will blow you off,\" he threatened. \nA cold shiver ran down my spine at his threat.\nThey stood there untouched. He drew a gun from the back of his pocket and shot them on the spot.\nHe pressed the button as the gate rolled out.\nHe entered his car and banged the car door. I watched with awe as he turned on the car.\nDid he just kill for me?\n\"Are you okay?\" He asked his eyes on the road that led to Lexi's house.\n\"Yes.\"\nHe spared me a glance, his eyes lingered on my top, his jaws tightened and then he looked away.\n\"You are not scared about what just happened.\"\n\"No. You will never hurt me.\" I said.\nA little smile appeared on his lips, \"Good.\"\nA comfortable silence evolved around us as I took my time to take in the intricate details of his body.\nHe wore a tight long shirt that enhanced his muscles. His black shining hair was perfectly combed with some strands falling on his forehead. His perfectly curved heart-shaped lips made it irresistible for me to look away.\n\"I think you are going to be committing adultery anytime soon,\" my wolf spoke from within.\nI nodded with a smile, my skin lit with fire.\n\"Forgive me but I made Benedicta do a spell around Lexie's house. That was how I knew he was being attacked.\"\nNo wonder he knew about the attack and here I was suspecting him. The car stopped at Lexie's house.\n\"I will drive off to Benedict's house while you go in. Dean might send people to follow me and I want them to think we are with Benedicta'' he said.\nI nodded with a smile. \"Thank you,\" I said and sneaked into  Lexie's house.\nImmediately I opened the door and Merlin rushed towards me and jumped on me.\n\"The man who came that day. He saved me. They wanted to kill me,\" he said in a low shivering voice.\nI hugged him tight as I caressed his hair. \"It's okay. I'm here\" I said.\nLexie walked towards me. With watery eyes. Gosh, she must be so scared.\n\"The ruthless rogue was the one who saved us. There were five. They wanted to kill Merlin but somehow he killed three. Two ran away.\" Lexie said.\n\"I'm sorry.\" I apologized.\nIt's okay. Just be careful,\" she said with a smile.\nI spent the last hour with Merlin. Immediately Luca honked at me and I bade goodbye to Merlin.\nHe started crying. He did not want to leave me. He was so scared. I consoled him and promised to be back and left.\nThe ride back home was silent. Luca seemed tense.\nImmediately we got into the palace. The guard stood in front of us. \"The Alpha wants to see you.\"\nLuca nodded and we walked inside the house.\nDean's father together with all the royal members stood there staring at us.\n\"Why did the both of you visit a witch this morning?\" He asked.\nMy heart sank into my chest. It meant Benedicta was in trouble",

I looked at the time I was just five o'clock in the morning.\nWhat could be so urgent that they had come to knock on my door?\nIt better be something reasonable. I rubbed off the sleep from my eyelid and went to open the door.\nI met Alberto, the head of the palace guard panting several beads of sweat dropped off his head.\n\"What is the matter?\" I asked as I closed my door behind me.\nHe bowed his head \"Two of our men were killed\"\n\"What?\" I asked my voice low with surprise.\n\"Are we under attack?\" I asked\n\"No.\" They were the ones you appointed at the gate. Lia woke up a few minutes ago to go out and we refused as you instructed\" he said and paused for a while.\nGoosebumps filled my skin. Could it be that Lia was the one who killed them?\nBut she looked too innocent for that.\n\"She went back and came out with Luca. They told him what you said and he told them to leave the gate. When they refused he shot the both of them and went out with Lia\" he explained.\nI groaned, where could they have gone this early morning? Could they be having an -\nNo, Lia does not look like someone who would fall for Luca. Besides, Luca has never been the faithful type.\n\"Send our men to trace them and tell us as soon as they can. Or better still, track them if they can!\" I shouted.\nHe bowed immediately and left. I went inside my room and closed the door with a bang.\nLorenzo came in a few minutes later. His eyes widened as if he had heard what had happened.\n\"We need to stop Luca. Or he might kill Lia, there is no other reason he could decide to help her. He is trying to be an angel\" he said as he sat on my bed.\nWhile I paced around, I walked toward the window where I could have a clear view of the park.\n\"Or, he might be having feelings for her.\"\nThe Luca I knew would not kill someone for just any woman.\nThis made my body itch the more, I wanted to dig into his heart to know if he wanted to kill her or if he wanted to have her.\nI got the information later on that they had gone to visit Sabrina. At least that was where his car stopped.\nI immediately told my father and he had decided to wait till they returned to punish Luca if he could not give a good reason.\nMinutes later he drove into the palace at full speed.\nBlood riled up within me as I saw Lia and Luca step out of the car.  Like what in \"stay away from my mate\" did he not understand?\nAlthough he pointed out that she was not yet my wife. I could not just wrap my head around the fact that she spent more time with him than with me.\nEven though I knew I had made myself unavailable she could have grown a bond with someone else. \nNot  Luca.\nAfter the scene last night, I had concluded that I would stop whatever bond they had before it became too risky.\nLuca was a sly, cunning snake. For all I might know he might be using Lia as a pawn in his game.\nWorst still was that Lia was innocent. \nI thought he was going to listen to me and stay away from Lia. \nSo imagine my fucking surprise he came out and even opened the door for Lia to come out.\n\"Why did the both of you visit a witch this morning?\" my father asked immediately as they entered.\nHe smiled and his eyes darted to mine\n\"So you had me followed,\" Luca asked with a crooked smile. \nI glared at him.\n\"Where did you take the future Luna to?\" My father asked with a stern voice.\nLuca swallowed \"We went to see Sabrina. You allowed her to be in the park even though she is a witch. So you can't tell me we can't visit her,\" he said and glanced at Lia, his lips raised at one side.\nLia nodded with relief. That only meant one thing. \nLuca had tricked us. They did not visit Sabrina.\nHe smiled at me as if he knew what I was thinking.\nBloody bastard! I muttered.\n\"Why did you go with Luca?\" My father asked Lia.\nLia tightened her grip around her bag \"Your son refused to allow me to go on my own\" she reported.\n\"And why were you going to Sabrina \"\n\"For protection\" She answered with confidence.\n\"For protection?\"\n\"Yes, my maid was killed last night. A man attacked me and almost stabbed me. An outsider because he did not have our scent\" she replied. It was clear that they had planned this together.\nMy father turned to look at me with a lowered eyebrow of course I skipped the path of Lia being attacked.\n\"Dean, were we attacked?\" he asked me in a deep voice.\nI nodded\n\"And you did not deem to tell me?\" He asked again.\nI kept quiet. How was I meant to tell him that if I had to tell him? I would have told him that my mate openly hugged Luca.\nConfided in Luca in front of me.\nHe shook his head and turned to them \"You all can go. And Luca we do not kill our own. Put it at the back of your mind\" he warned him\n\"Get ready for the mating ceremony this evening,\" he said and left.\nLuca walked up to me and leaned into my ear \"Try harder next time\" he whispered and left me.\nI glared at him. Of course, there will be no next time because I would have marked her as my mate.\nI walked inside to prepare for the re-mating ceremony.",

        "content": "Lia POV.\nWhen we entered the palace and met the Alpha waiting for us. My heart sank deep into the depths of my stomach.\nThey had followed us. How much information did they get?\nDid they find out about me and Merlin?\nWhat were they going to do?\nDid they trace Luca's car to Benedicta's house?\nTo confirm my fear the Alpha asked \"Why did the both of you visit a witch today?\"\nIt only met one thing. They had found out that Luca had gone to visit Benedicta.\nBut Benedicta was not old. She was a middle-aged woman. In her early fifties.\nIf they knew that she was a witch it meant that they were going to kill her.\nI looked at Luca who seemed to care less about what they said. \nMany thoughts ran through my mind as I tried to fathom the reason why he seemed so unbothered.\nDid he allow them to see him?\nGosh! Benedicta was the only parental figure in my life. I could not lose her.\nImmediately he confirmed that it was Sabrina, I heaved a sigh., I think Dean noticed my reaction because he immediately raised an eyebrow.\nHe looked too pissed. As if he was angry that I was spending time with Luca.\nI rolled my eyes as bile riled up within me in disgust. He was just pretending.\nI was sure that he wanted me dead and out of sight.\nLuckily for us or should I say thanks to Luca we were spared.\nLike we were spared! After Luca killed two bodyguards we were spared. \nWow! The king held him in high regard because it was a law in our park.\n\"You do not hurt your kind.\"\nIf you killed a werewolf you were liable to death with an oak treatment.\nMeaning they would slowly use the oak to stab you until. you die.\nAfter announcing my engagement, the king left. Luca whispered something to Dean and walked away.\nNot after he winked at me. A gesture that made my body grow warm.\n\"You are in front of your mate!\" My wolf growled within me.\nI looked up to see Dean glaring at me. I glared at him back. What the hell was his problem?\nAfter all, he did not want me.\nI sighed and walked towards my room. A lady dressed in maid clothes stood at the front of my door.\n\"Who are you?\" I asked her.\nShe smiled and bowed her head \"I am Sasha. I will be your maid till Magause gets well\" she explained.\nI nodded at her. I glanced at her from her head to her toe. For some reason, I felt very uncomfortable around her.\n\"Okay. You can go\" I dismissed her and walked into my room.\nI laid all the bed as I turned around on my bed as I waited for the evening to come.\nLuca felt so unbothered about the wedding. Or maybe he was trying to feign ignorance.\nA few hours later, Sasha knocked on my door with some makeup kits to get me ready.\n\"I would make you the most beautiful bride ever,\" she said with a smile, a forced smile. I could detect it was a fake smile from the line of her lips.\nI smiled, nodded, and watched as she did it. \"So are you happy about today's ceremony?\" she asked as she applied the makeup.\nI held her hands for a while. She stopped to look at me.\"What do you mean?\" I asked with a steel voice. My eyebrows lowered with anger.\nWhat was she trying to imply?\nShe smiled at me. A smile I found genuinely irrigated about.\n\"I was just trying to start a conversion. You seemed quiet for a bride\" she said and continued with her makeup.\n\"Well, I am happy for my wedding. I am going to be Luna after all. Besides I don't have anyone to talk to about it\" I retorted.\n\"You could talk to me. I am your maid\" she said.\nI gave her a forced smile \"Exactly. You are my maid and not a friend. Now will you finish up\" I blurted out.\nShe smiled at me and continued doing the makeup.\nI wore the exact clothes Luca gave me. A red gown with a silver necklace and shoes.\nJust as Luca said, Dean did not bother to send me my dress. He did not care about me.\nAs I walked toward the hall, I realized that I was meant to have a bridesmaid to hold my flower.\nI also needed a man, or relative to walk me down the altar. I had no one. Benedicta was a witch and Lexie was meant to stay with Merlin.\nI squared my shoulder and walked towards the door. Luca stood at the side, in white trousers and a suit. His inner shirt tightened around him enhancing his features.\nHe cleared his throat and gave me his arms with a smile, I took it and made my way towards the altar.\nWhen we got to the altar, Dean stretched forth his hands and took my hands from Luca.\nThey immediately commenced their mating rights.\nAnd I was crowned the Luna, however one thing was missing.\nDean was not my mate. The moon goddess has refused to rematch us.\nDean looked worried, on the other hand, I was happy, I was free and even though I did not know who my mate was at least I was not Dean's mate and that was all that mattered.\nI looked at Luca's eyes and even though he tried to keep his face blank I saw a glint of joy in his eyes.",

        "content": "Dean's POV\nI stood rotted in my spot after I kissed Lia and nothing happened.\nLike no connection, nothing happened. Adrenaline rushed through my spine as my chest tightened.\nShe was not my mate. The moon goddess had refused to remate us together after I had rejected her.\nThen who was her mate and who was my mate? Although I still feel drawn to her. I did not know why.\nI looked at her face which shone with a smile. She was really happy that she was not mated to me.\nI am meant to feel the same way too but a pang of sadness missed with fear gripped me.\nShe looked at Luca, whose eyes shone with relief. \nWere they mated together and refused to tell anyone?\nI stood at the edge of the hall where they used to hold the ceremony. I watched as dignified people walked in.\nAlpha and Luna are accompanied by their Betta. \nI searched for Lia but she was not in the crowd. Maybe she went to change her clothes.\nI sipped my wine as I smiled at the some familiar faces \nI looked at the time it was six-fifty and Lia was nowhere to be found.\nWhere was she? Don't tell me she wants to be late for our first appearance as couples \n\"What are you going to do?\" Lorenzo asked as he stood beside me. His hands were in his pocket while the other held a glass of wine.\n\"About what?\" I asked my attention while still in the crowd.\n\"About lia. We both know she is not your mate\" he whispered.\nI shrugged \"I don't know. I mean she was meant to be my mate. I wonder why we were not mated together\" I said with a little bit of sadness in my voice.\n\"Who do you think is her mate? Could it be Luca\" he asked.\nI shook my head in disbelief \"No, it can't be\" If it was Luca he would have made sure he marked her and made it known to me.\n\"Then who could he be,\" he asked, his voice masked with worry.\nI knew why he was worried. I was also worried as well. We did not know who both our mates were.\nIt meant our pack was in trouble. I imagined her mate to be an alpha from an enemy pack.\nIt would bring in war as he would do everything within his power to have her.\nLet's not talk about me. Although I felt relieved. It's not like I wanted to have a mate before. \nI would be free to fuck with whoever I wanted without fear of commitment.\nBut with Lia it was different. After seeing her, taking in her scent. All I wanted was to be with her.\nTo make her mine and make Luca burn with unending jealousy \nTuah! Tuah!\nGunshots filled the air. Everyone scattered around as they ran for safety. Bodyguards protected their Alpha.\nI searched around for Lia. She was not around. Lorenzo had already left my side to go and organize our men.\nLuca's eyes went with mine. He mouthed \"Have you seen Lia?\"\nI shook my head. He immediately drifted out of the hall even with the gunshot and for the first time, I thanked my stars that Lia had someone else who cared about her.\nLia POV.\nUp until now. I thought only bad things happened to me. And to some extent,  I felt it was true.\nLike I had a one-night stand and got pregnant. \nMy mate rejected me.\nI started falling for my husband's cousin.\nUntil the moon goddess decided not to remate me and Dean again.\nI thanked the moon goddess within me. I did not want to go through the excruciating pain I went through the first time when he rejected me.\nAnd I was sure that if we were related he would cheat on me again.\nImmediately after the ceremony was over, I walked toward my room to change my clothes and put on something more Luna.\nI knew that after a while, Dean would start greeting the other Alphas then I would slip to Luca's side to tease him.\nI retouched my makeup, smeared my lips with red lip gloss, and sprayed perfume.\nI made my way towards my corridor. I had to get to the corridor before seven o'clock.\nTuah!Tuah!\nI heard a gunshot. It meant that we were being attacked. By who? I thought we were at peace with all the packs.\nI immediately entered the next open room and hid.\nI heard footsteps coming this way \" Search the whole room we have to find their Luna\" a lethal male voice ordered.\nMy heartbeat increased as beads of sweat gathered around my forehead.\nThey were looking for me. I moved towards the shelf to hide.\nA flower vase fell and shattered on the ground.\nSomeone immediately entered the room, pointing a gun around.\nI peeped through the books and saw him.\n\"Where are you? Come out!\" He shouted.\nI sighed, what a stupid twat. Who asks someone to come outside when they know that they can hide?\nLittle by little he made his way towards my direction. My heartbeat increased rapidly.\nHe came closer and soon he was in front of me. \nI stared in horror at the man standing in front of me. My heartbeat increased. \nWe were wolves, guns could not kill us but they made us weak.\nAnd I was sure they wanted to kill me after all they were looking for Luna.\nAnd then, amid this confusion and tension. \nWe stared at each other and chorused \"Mate\"\nHe stared at me in disbelief as he put his gun down. \"Who are you?\" He asked.\nI swallowed hard, he did not think I was going to reveal my identity because I was his mate. Hell no!\nHe stepped towards me as my heartbeat increased, and heat oozed out from my body.\nI was already reacting to the presence of my mate. He moved the strand of my hair behind my ear. He leaned towards me.\nI closed my eyes as sensation flowed through me. I was already wet by the mere touch.\n\"Tell me who you are and I promise not to hurt you\" he whispered against my ear. His hot breath fanned my face.\n\"I'm a.. I'm Luna\" I whispered back.\nHe immediately drew back, his eyes wide with shock.\n\"How come you are my mate?\" He asked with disbelief. \"Are you not meant to be Dean's mate?\" he asked.\n\"Dean rejected me once. We were not related\" I said.\n\"Fuck!\" He shouted as he punched the wall.\nThe door opened as someone entered\"Finn have you found her!\" he asked\nIn a split second, he hid me under the table.\n\"No,\" he answered.\n\"Fuck!\" We searched for her everywhere, \"the voice said.\n\" send the men back to the cars. Dean would soon retaliate\" he ordered.\nThe other one left immediately after his order.\n\"Come outside\" he ordered.\nI came out of the table. He gazed at me. His eyes filled with desire.\nHe walked towards me and sniffed me in.\n\"I would come back for you,\" he said and left immediately.\nI heaved a sigh of relief. \"Now who was on earth is Finn and what park is he from\"",

        "content": "Lia POV\nThe room was silent, dead silent, gunshots continued outside until they died down, and all this time I stood by the back of the library shelf. My back was pressed against the shelf.\nThey came to get me, maybe use me as bait to make Dean do something for them since he was my mate. What they did not know was that Dean hated me.\nHe would see their attack as good riddance to bad rubbish but that was not my main problem.\nThe main issue for me was that I had a mate. A mate from an enemy pack. I did not know what position he obtained in the pack.\nAll I knew was that he saved me, he let me leave and he promised to get me. \nThis meant that in no time, there might be a war between two packs just because of me. Not because Dean cared but because it would hurt his ego to let another take his Luna.\nAfter all, he did not have a Luna.\nThe door clicked open, and someone entered inside. I peeped through the frame and it was Luca.\n\"Lia, are you here?\" He whispered looking around still pointing his gun in every possible direction his gun could go.\n\"Luca!\" I answered with a smile, my voice low. He turned around and caught sight of me. \nI expected him to walk towards me and ask me if I was okay. Instead, he walked back to lock the door.\nThen he walked towards me quickly. He stood at my front staring at me. His eyes were darker than usual.\n\"Are you hurt?\" he asked as his eyes moved around my body causing heat at every part he played his sinful eyes on.\nI shook my head \"I'm fine. They were not able to catch me\" I lied easily.\nIf he learned about my mate's appearance he might not be pleased because he was from an enemy park.\n\"Are you sure?\" He asked again, this time his hot palms cupped my cheek as he examined my face.\n\"Yes,\" I replied in a whisper.\n\"Who were the people who attacked us?\" I asked in a whisper because he was too close to me. I could not think.\nHe drifted backwards as if he too noticed my reaction.\n\"They are from the Bloodhound Pack. They claimed our Alpha killed their luna a long time ago and they always make sure they kill every luna. They come across\"\nMy heart sank into my chest as he explained their intention. It meant that sooner than later they would come for me and if they could, they would kill me.\nMy skin turned pale with fear, and I took in shaky breaths. What have I gotten myself into?\nAs if Luca noticed my worry, he took my palm into his own hands. \"Lia, we will protect you. You will be fine. We would not let them attack you again. Thank God that Finn did not see you. We would have been  in trouble \"\nAt the mention of Finn's name, I almost fainted. Like my knees got weak and I had to hold on to him for a while before I got stable.\n\"Lia, is something wrong?\" Luca asked, his voice filled with concern. \nI shook my head \"I'm fine. It seems as if I am still in shock\" I replied.\nHe heaved a sigh of relief. \"You can come and sit down,\" he said\n\"Are they gone?\" I asked just to be sure.\n\"Yes, they left immediately they did not see you although they shot Dean, he will recover,\" he said with a smile.\n\"Who is Finn to the pack,\" I asked with a plain voice as I tried to hide my fear or the excitement that came with the memory of him.\n\"Oh, he is the Lycan's son,\" Luca answered, his eyes reduced to a split as he stared at me. \"You seem so interested in him lia\" he noted\n\"Oh. Nothing, because I heard someone call Finn when they passed through here\" I replied as I tried to balance my voice.\n\"Thanks to the moon goddess that he did not see you. Come let's go\" he said, leading the way.\nAs we walked towards our corridor, I  stopped on my track. My mind went to Dean and I could not help but wonder how he was.\n\"Let me see Dean,\" I said and made my way towards the stairs, Luca's hands gripped me.\n\"Why, I thought you said you did not care about him,\" he asked, his voice low with dark eyes.\nI shrugged\"He is my Alpha, and I am his Luna\" I replied.\nHis grip tightened his grip around my hands as he drew me closer.\"For context he is not your Alpha. You have not yet found your mate\" he warned his voice deep with unknown anger.\nIf only he knew I had found my mate or that Finn was my mate.\n\"Have you found yours?\" I asked him. He furrowed his eyebrows \"Your mate\" I added\n\"Yeah but she died?\" he answered with sad eyes\n\"I'm sorry what killed her,\" I asked.\nHe chuckled dryly as if he was unentertained \"Your question should be who killed her\"\n\"Who?\"\nHe gave me a creepy smile\"Dean. So I leaked his mother's whereabouts to Finn and he killed her\"\nMy eyes widened in shock. No wonder the Alpha sent him away.\"So that was why you, the Alpha asked you to leave somewhere else?\"\nHe nodded with pride\"Yes\"\nCold feet eloped me. What if he also wanted to kill me to avenge Dean? Maybe he thought we would be re-mated\"Why are you telling me this?\"\nHe shrugged\"Because you should consider yourself lucky that you are not Dean's mate\"\n\"Now go to your room\" he ordered.\nI nodded and quickened my steps towards my room. Everyone around this place was so weird and they had different goals.\nI entered my room and locked the door, I switched on the light\nSomeone was on my bed, no not someone, Finn was on my bed, completely shirtless.\n\"Hello mate,\" he said with a creepy smile.",

        "content": "Lia POV\nMy heart sank into my stomach at the sight of Finn in my room not just in my room, but on my bed, and not only was he in my bed he was shirtless. Displaying his godly abs.\n\"What are you doing here,\" I asked in a whisper. It was meant to come as a bold threatening voice.\nHe was our enemy, even though he was our mate. His father wanted my head.\nCould it be that he came to take me secretly, lure me out of the palace maybe fuck me once or twice, and then kill me.\nDifferent thoughts ran through my mind. The air in the room became so thick that I could not breathe, beads of sweat laced on my forehead.\nHe stood up from the bed and walked towards me. I bent my head in fear, and my hands trembled.\nHis two middle fingers found my chin as he lifted my head to him making me stare at him.\nAll the fear vanished, it was replaced by a burning sensation that crept on my skin as I looked at his dark blue eyes.\n\"Breath\" he ordered slowly.\nI inhaled and exhaled for a while trying my best to control whatever emotion that was flooding me. Whatever feeling made my nipples rise and my core wet.\nWhen he noticed that I had managed to steady my breaths he took a step backwards.\n\"I'm not here to hurt you if that's what you are thinking.\" He said softly and walked towards my bed and a sardonic smile crept on his face.\nHe brought out his gun and placed it on the table.\nIt was loaded. I could tell from the way he placed it carefully, then he looked at me again.\nFear gushed within me, and my tongue turned dry. I had no weapons with me, not even a knife.\n\"Please don't kill me\" I begged as my thoughts ran to my son. He can't be left alone in the world.\nHe took the gun and walked up to me. I sucked in my breath as I watched him raise the gun to caress my face. It stopped at my lips and for a moment, just one moment I was tempted to scream Luca's name but his recent behaviour made me stop.\n\"You are my mate, I would never let any harm come to you lia,\" he said and took my hand.\nStill staring at me he placed the gun in my hands \"It's the only weapon I have. It's in your hands. I can't hurt you\" he said.\nI swallowed whatever lump in my throat. He had made himself available at my mercy.\nHe was my second chance mate. I might not find another mate after him.\n\"Let's talk,\" he said and walked back to the bed, he sat down and placed his palm on the other side signaling me to sit beside him.\nI walked up to him and sat beside him.\nHe cleared his throat and spoke. His deep, rich husky voice caressed my skin \"Are you going to tell him or should I do the honors\" he asked as his eyes bore holes into my skin.\nI furrowed my eyebrows \"Who are we talking about here?\" I was confused.\nHe raised an eyebrow as he watched my face for some trace of mischief. I sincerely did not know who he was talking about.\n\"Dean. When are you going to tell him that I am your mate?\" He asked calmly.\nI turned my eyes away from his. Why has the moon goddess decided to be this wicked? How can she put me in this dilemma? I was Dean's Luna, Luca's friend, or whatever was going on between us and Finn's mate who was my enemy, and worst still I had a child for Dean.\nHis pack would not accept an illegitimate child, Dean did not remember that night or anything that happened between that night.\nI cleared my throat \"Your father wants me dead\" I said as I tried to avoid the question.\n\"That was because he thought you were Dean's mate but since you are my mate. He would be happy. Besides, I have been dying to see my mate\" he replied with a smile. I could tell that he was genuinely happy.\nHis smile watched away as it came \"Are you in love?\" He asked me.\n\"With whom?\" I asked\n\"Dean. Is that why you are hesitating?\"\nI shook my head immediately \"No!\" I shouted as irritation crept on my face. That man had no feelings for anyone.\n\"We were mates but he rejected me\" I noted.\nHe nodded with a smile \"Good!. If not I would be forced to kill him\" he added and stared at me before his eyes landed on my pink lip. His gaze darkened then he looked away.\n\"So when are you going to tell him? I need an exact time so that when I come to claim you. You will be ready\" he said and smiled.\n\"A week or two,\" I said. I  needed to see Benedicta and Lexie and arrange things out.\nHe nodded with a smile and leaned towards me. \nI sucked my breath, and fire erupted around me as a sensual sensation washed through me.\nHis lips met mine, his lips soft and tender, I closed my eyes and opened my mouth to take in his warm scent.\nThe kiss was sweet, soft, and delicate. He broke it. We were breathing heavily. A smile placed on his lips.\nOur eyes burned off desires \"I will come back for you in two weeks\" he said and put on his white shirt he dropped his gun on my table.\n\"Use it to protect yourself\" he ordered. I nodded even though I did not know how to shake a gun. He pecked my forehead and left the way he came through the window.\nI smiled as I watched him walk. For the first time in my whole life. I felt loved, I felt valued. Even after he left his eyes still bored into my skin.\nA loud bang brought me from my thoughts. It was Luca's voice.\nI rushed towards the door and opened it. \"What happened?\" I asked.\nHe ignored me and burst into my room searching around for someone\"Dean's father was killed by Leo, Finn's beta. He had escaped but we think Finn might still be around?\" he informed me.",

The same Finn who had been in my room and kissed me.\nHere I thought he risked his life to see me. I suddenly felt dirty and used. He did not come here because he valued me. He came to my room to pass the time while his friend killed my Alpha.\nHe knew he would be safe with me after all I was his mate. No one would come here so he let himself play with my feelings.\nI curled my palms into a fist as anger swept through me.\n\"Did you see him?\" Luca asked me. His eyes were red with anger. Dean's father was the only one whom he had on his side.\nEven though he committed such an atrocity he still welcomed him when he came back. Losing him must have been painful to him.\nI shook my head \"No. I don't even know who he is\"\nLuca sniffed around the room. I sucked in my breath. Hope he did not smell him. I would be dead. It would mean I harbored a killer in my room.\nLuca's eyes reduced to a split, he glanced through me from my shoes to my top. He glanced around the room looking for some clue. He walked towards me steadily with baby steps.\n\"What do you know?\" Luca asked as his rough palm caressed my neck. \nI took in a shaky breath, my palm became sweaty like a wet towel. I swallowed hard \"What do.. Do you mean? If I knew somethingI would tell you\" I stuttered looking at him.\nHe glared at me for a while before he stepped back. \"Keep your door open. I will be back\" he ordered and left.\nI took in a shaky breath as he closed the door. I took my pillow but it smelt different. It smelt of Finn. I took out my perfume and sprayed it around my pillow before lying on it.\nI closed my eyes as my mind went back to his full pink lip, his smell, the kiss. I moved my hands to feel my lips, and my thumb caressed his impact on it.\nI suddenly drew my hands from what I was doing. Gosh! Why would I let such a memory get to me? \nKnock! Knock! Knock!\nI stood up and went to open the door. Luca came inside. His shoulders tensed. His face carried a sardonic tone.\n\"What's wrong?\" I asked immediately I closed the door behind me.\nHe kept quiet for a while and sat in my bed. Up until now, I had known Luca to always carry a blank face. His emotions were calculative but seeing him like this with his head bent. I knew that his uncle's death had pained him.\n\"Dean thinks I killed his father.\" He said in a low voice. He ran his hands across his head vigorously, when he raised his head his eyes were tear-stained.\n\"How could he think so low about me? I mean he is my uncle. He was the only one who loved me even though I was a rogue. My father hated me for being a rogue. How could he think that I wanted to kill him\" he asked. His voice sounded broken.\nI walked towards him and rubbed his shoulders. The fact that he came to me meant he valued me, he saw me in a higher way.\n\"you can explain yourself besides you said it was Leo. Right?\"I asked.\nHe nodded. \"They caught him. But he still thinks that I am responsible maybe I sneaked him in or something\"\nHe sniffed in loudly with shaky breaths. His veiny hands trembled. He was in so much pain, seeing him like this made my heart ache.\n\"I mean he is my uncle. Why on earth would I want to hurt him? I don't hurt the people I love\" he said and the last part felt as if it was directed at me.\nI swallowed hard. He took in unsteady breath \"He thinks I did it for you,\" he said.\nI furrowed my eyebrows \"What?\" I asked.\nHe shook his head and nodded \" He thinks we are fucking each other\" he said.\nMy face grew pale. \" why would he think about us like that \" \n\"Dean is very observant. He saw the way you hugged me. He said he sees the way we look at each other\" he said.\nI stared at him, he stared at me for a while. Our eyes moved to our lips, and we drew closer to each other\"\nThe door burst open. Dean, Lorenzo, and Sasha came in all glaring at us.\nSasha pointed at me \"I heard her talking to Finn\"  she said.\nI opened my mouth in shock. I stared at her. Luca burst into laughter.\n\"Is this a joke? What will Finn be doing with her?\" he asked still laughing.\n\"I heard him talking to her,\" she said again.\n\"You are not even my mate. You are going to pay dearly\" he said and ordered some men to take me.\nIn a split moment,, Luca had his dagger pressed against Sasha's neck. Her eyes shone with fear.\n\"Touch her and I promise to throw your fucking buddy into the den or give the pieces of her body to the dogs\" he threatened. His voice was so lethal.\nSo Sasha was his mistress. No wonder I was not okay with being friends with her. \nDean's jaw clenched. \"Luca let her go\"\n\"Let Lia go\" he retorted.\n\"Or else what?\" Dean asked him.\n\"Or else I am going to do to you what you did to me. Lia is not your mate so she is safe and I will keep her but I will make sure I kill your mate the instant you set your eyes on her\" he warned.\nThey glared at each other for a while. Luca pressed the blade against her.\n\" let her go\" Dean ordered.",

        "content": "Dean POV\nImmediately I found out that Lia was not my mate, and my heart sank into the depths of my stomach. I knew I was in an impending doom. It seems that the moon goddess has decided to punish me.\nTruth be told, I wanted Lia to be my mate again. The concept of Luca or someone else having her did not just sit well with me but I said nothing or did nothing.\nNow she was my Luna and my father was dead and she was not my mate neither was I her mate.\nIf I am being honest I knew that the Bloodhound Park was going to attack. I did not just know it would be on the day of our coronation.\nThey not only attacked us, they decided to kill my father when they did not see Lia.\nMy heart burned with raw anger for them. The fact that they had killed him on his bed was most insulting.\nI sat beside my father staring at his dead ash body. I swallowed whatever lump was in my throat. Hate it or not he had been my father all the skills I had learned had been from him.\nNow he is gone. Gone with his old croaky voice, his one-sided smile, his glare anytime we had a quarrel and most importantly he was done with his counsel.\nI was clinging to his cold hands when Sasha knocked on the door. \n\"Come in,\" I said as I cleared my throat and wiped whatever sad face I had. I put on a dark blank face meant for Alphas.\nShe came inside silently, her spicy scent filled the air. She wore a white sleeveless gown with brown scandal.\nShe had come here to seduce me but I needed to put boundaries. I now had a Luna and like it or not, I cared about her opinion. \n\"Sasha, why are you not putting on your garment?\" I asked her with a steel voice.\nShe smiled a sexual smile. \"But I am putting on a garment\" she answered as she drew her hands across her body.\nI shook my head if it was another maid I would have had her head since but because I knew that Lia was not going to let me touch her at least not now I said\" I am married Sasha I am not saying I am not going to visit you I am saying dress properly, you are going to be Lia's maid\" I ordered\nShe scoffed \"Oh please, you sit here and try to be faithful to a woman that had Finn in her room while Leo killed your father. Come-\"\nI turned to her, glaring at her \"What?\"\nShe smiled and sat beside me \"You heard what I said. I came to give her food and heard Finn talking to her\"\nFirst of all, I took her hands from my chest and secondly, I made my way towards Lorenzo's room. What would Finn be doing with Lia?\nLorenzo received the news with his usual dry composure as he thought of what to do.\n\"She could be lying, you know. It might be that she just wants you to get to her bed, \"he said after a long silence.\n\" I know, but why would she tag lia with Finn, she could have said they were with Luca\" I reasoned. \"I mean it does not make sense,\" I added.\nLuca stared at the ceiling for a while thinking. Why would Finn be with Lia?\nLorenzo jumped as if he got the solution to the puzzle. He sat up and stared at me.\n\"Maybe Finn is her mate\" he suggested\nI searched his face for mischief but there was none, I chuckled \"Is that the great idea you have?\" I asked.\nHe nodded\"Yes\"\nIt took me everything within me not to call him a twat.\"Seriously, that's your great idea\" I asked again.\nHe nodded and sat upright to explain his useless theory\"Yes. Come to think of it Dean, there is no way Finn would have searched the entire mansion and not found Lia. She is not a warrior. She did not even know\"\n\"Meaning?\" I asked because I saw no sense in what he was talking about.\nLorenzo shook his head in disbelief, he opened his mouth and I was sure whatever was about to come out would be a curse, I glared at him and he shut his mouth.\n\"But seriously, it could be that he spared her life because she is his mate.\"\n\"And you think Finn would decide to leave his mate in his enemy's territory?\"I asked \n\"No but maybe he left her to get accompanied by the fact she is his mate and use her as a spy,\" he said. Everything began to make sense to me.\n\"That was why he killed my father because he could not kill her?\"\nHe nodded. That meant he might still be with her in her room. \n\"We have to arrest her,\" I said. I would not let her go scot-free and if we had his mate, Finn would surely come to look for her and we would make him pay for what he did\nI burst into the room to see another annoying sight. Lia had her hands run resting on his shoulders.\nI hissed with annoyance, Luca was a coward for falling for his mate while I had his mate locked somewhere.\nHow would his mate feel when she discovered that he was falling for his cousin's wife?\nI needed to get her out of there before she caught me in her web because no matter how I did it I still felt a sickening feeling anytime I saw her with someone else.\nI brought in Sasha to testify against her and told my men to arrest her. My thought was that Luca would not let her go freely. Maybe he would challenge me. What I did not know was that he was ready to kill Sasha for her.\nI watched in awe as he pressed his knife to her neck and his eyes held raw anger. If I forced him he would kill Sasha and feel nothing.\nNo one knew he was a bloodthirsty wolf.\n\"Let her go\" I ordered my men. They let Lia go and I turned to Luca with a smile.\n\"Has Lia told you that she knows her mate?\" I asked with a crooked smile.\nHis face grew pale as he turned to Lia, in that swift instance I brought the white steak and daggered his chest with it.\nHe would remain there till I deemed it fit to let him go.\nI turned to the already pale Lia with a smile \"Now no one would come to your rescue\" I said.",

It therefore means that Luca will not be away for now.\nHe looks at me with an evil grin \"Now no one can rescue you\" It seems as if he has evil plans against me.\nWhat was he going to do?  Ask me if I was Finn's mate. Of course, I am going to deny it. I looked at Sasha who had a grin on her face.\nMy blood boils with anger, and I clench my fist to restrain myself from what I am going to do.\n\"Take her,\" he orders me. My eyes meet Lorenzo and his usual blank look. God help them if they do something stupid. I would tell them how I feel.\nThe guards grab my hands and take me out of the room. They throw me into a dark stinky room and chain my hands.\nI immediately know that I am going to go through hell.  They did not bring me before the court which means they are not going to kill me.\nI sit on the ground for a while, and my mind travels back to Merlin my child, he must have missed me. I can't imagine that I have not been in this palace for up to a month and I am already passing through hell.\nThe gate opened, and a familiar smell hit my nose. It's Dean. \nOne of the guards turned on the light and brought a chair for him and his beta Lorenzo.\nI glare at them, and they return it with blank faces. I wonder why he went in with the coronation after he knew I was not his mate. I just pray Merlin does not have his characters.\nHe clears his throat. A maid enters inside with a bowl of pepper, and a whip soaked into it. Fear grips me at the thought of what they are about to do to me.\nDon't tell me they are going to use that whip on me. I close my eyes as tears fall. If Luca was here he would not let this happen. I am suddenly happy that Merlin was not brought to the palace.\nI would keep his birth a secret till I die.\n\"Why the tears? Are you already imagining what we are going to do to you?  he asks with a grin.\nI raise my face to look at him, my hands still chained to the wall.\n\"What do you want?\" I ask him, my eyes bloodshot from tears and anger.\n\"I want to know why you decided to keep my father's killer within the pack?\" He asks.\n\"I did not see Finn. I do not know Finn\" I answer.\nHe signals to the guard. He takes the pepper-soaked whip and whips my back once. I close my eyes as my back explodes in pain. The pain is so raw, it gets into my brain.\n\"Well if you must know Finn is your mate. The one you let into your bedroom\" he answers.\nI wish I had told  Finn to take me with him, this nonsense would have not happened but then I would have not been able to see my son or tell Luca or Benedicta goodbye.\n\"The only person that came to my room was Luca\"\nLorenzo chuckled \"So you have finally accepted that you are offering your body to your husband's cousin\"\nAnger mixed with pain rushed within me.  He was always walking at the back of Dean like a slave.\nI closed my eyes as I suck in all the pain \"One, I  did not offer my body to Luca. He is my friend, it is not my fault that he has a heart that you don't have. And as for people who sleep around, why don't you ask your friend? Or-\"\nBefore I complete the sentence a loud thud sounds across the room. Dean had just slapped me.  I taste metal on my lips.\nNo man has ever slapped me. In that instance,  I vow to never be quiet or succumb to their laws.\n\" The next time you call me a name like that I will give your body to the lions to feed on\" he warns me.\nI curse him under my breath, and another whip lands on my back this time it is twice.\nAh,h I scream in pain. One thing I know for sure is that I have a long way to go and it is not like they are going to release me anytime soon.\nMy body starts becoming weak as my wolf growls slowly.\n\"Is Finn your mate or not?\" He asks me as he sits down back in his chair.\n\"Is the dog your mate or not?\" I retorted back.\nHe furrowed his eyebrow as he narrowed his eyes ``Did you just ask me if I have a dog as a mate?\" He asks as he lowers his height to mine.\nI am weak,  really weak but I would not let him see my weakness. \n\"I don't know because you rejected your first mate and the moon goddess has refused to remate you\" \nHe curls his hands into a fist and drives it into my face. I groan in pain. The worst thing is that I cannot do anything because I am chained,  not like I have the strength though.\n\"Do you know what your mate did? He killed my father. He killed the Alpha of your pack. I could banish you for harboring an enemy in your room\" he asks, his voice cold like steel.\n\"Then banish me\" \nHe chuckled and shook his head. \"That will be too easy. I will.make.you. pay\"  he says pointing towards me.\nHe stands up and so does Lorenzo. \"Give her twelve strokes,\" he says.\nThe guard nodes and bows his head as he leaves. They start whipping me with the pain gushing through me.\nI kept on counting until it got to twelve. I writhe in pain, as fresh wounds open up and the pain worsens with the pepper.\nThey release my hands and legs. I am grateful that they would leave me alone to cry.\nThen they lift me, taking me to where I do not know.",

Their fingers dig into my skin the more.\nI watch as they take me to the rooftop and make me kneel. One of the maids steps forward toward me.\n\"Forgive me, my Luna,\" she says as she begins to Zip my gown down.\n\"What are you doing?\" I ask as fear creeps into me. Why am I on the rooftop, a possible place for conviction, why are they undressing me? Are they about to behead me?\nBut people who they have beheaded in the past wore their clothes. If I knew a way to stop them and remove the dagger from his heart, at least he would not wish for my death like this.\nLuca could have protected me. I wish I had told him about my mate, he would have advised me. Told me to be careful and secure me. Then I would not be in this room with people who want to see me fall apart \n\"The Alpha has asked that we strip you naked and give you punishment meant for treason\" she informed me as she pulled off my clothes.\nTreason! The punishment for treason is death. If they were not going to kill me they were going to give me punishment meant for death.\nI kneel in front of them and two other guards completely naked. Tears rolled down my eyes. I have never been this humiliated.\nTo think that he allowed a common guard to look at Luna's body. It means he does not have any regard for me.\nTo make my pain worse the sun is at its highest temperature increasing the pepper pain.\nShe brings in the same bowl with pepper, wraps something in her hand, and begins to pour the pepper all over me from my neck downwards.\nBy this time I have no strength within me so I let them carry on with their work. \nSeconds turn into minutes and minutes into hours. The pepper had already dried on my skin and I think I have become numb to the pain. Is a surprise that I am still alive.\nSuddenly the guard poured cold water. I mean ice chilling water on me. I groan in pain. My wolf has been silent throughout.\nI close my eyes as I welcome myself to the familiar world called darkness. As I close my eyes I pray I die.\nAnd intact I think I died.\nI opened my eyes to a comforting darkness, scenes of what happened from Merlin's birth to my last moment played before me. I feel every pain,  every tear.\n\"Please stop\" I beg whoever is playing it as the pain becomes deeper reaching my bane.\nIt stops for a while and a woman who has skin like milk appears before me. She is wearing a silk white gown that shines so bright.\nHer necklace is made up of stars, and her white hair is so long that it flows down the ground. She has deep blue eyes and the moon is placed just above her crown. She smiles at me and bends to my height.\n\"My child\" she calls out as she stretches her hands to me, I flinch and move backward. She smiles even more.\n\"I am not your child. A mother would not allow her child to suffer in the hands of other people.\" I retorted.\n\"I did not allow you to suffer,\" she said with a smile. A gesture that is becoming annoying.\n\"So what do you call what you did? Making me get pregnant for Dean then making him reject me and mate me to someone who does not care about me or make me have feelings for his cousin?  What do you call that!?''I ask.\n\"Destiny\" she answers\nI lower my eyebrow \"What?\" I ask\n\"Destiny,  my child's destiny. It was your destiny to meet Dean,  Finn, and Luca. And don't be deceived Luca cares about you\" She answers.\nI chuckle \"You can't be serious\". Her face remained the same way \"Wait,  you are serious. You want me to die in Dean's hands. Anyway I am dead as you planned what do you do next\"\n\"I will send you back. To live, to correct things. You will bring the end of Dean's rule\"\n\"And who will take over\"\n\"Whoever you decide\"\n\"I don't want to go back. please\" I beg. The torture I suffered in Dean's hands is enough.\n\"You have to go, my child. If you don't, many people will die,  Merlin will be killed and his blood will be on your hands\" she says.\nShe points her hands toward the front and a picture of Merlin running towards the forest and someone pursuing him. He keeps on shouting my name, the person finally catches up with him and is about to slit his throat.\n\"No!\" I shouted as I shut my eyes.\nShe stretches her hands toward me \"Go and save your kind and your child\" she orders. My eyes close again as I welcome myself to another long silence.\nI open my eyes to find myself in a White painted room.  The smell of antiseptic hit my nose. I look around to see myself in a hospital. With the machine on. I have an oxygen mask around my nose.\n\"Oh, she's awake. She's alive\" a middle-aged woman who I guess is a nurse shouts as she runs to meet the doctor.\nThe doctor rushed in a few minutes later with his stethoscope hanging around his neck. He checks my heartbeat with a smile.\n\"Welcome back Luna,\" he says.\nI nod with a smile. He removed the mask from my nose and I heaved a sigh. Finally, I can breathe in fresh air.\n\"I am going to ask you a few questions before I let you go.\" he says and brings out his five fingers before me \"How many is that?\" He asks\n\"Five\" I answer. He keeps on asking me the same questions as he reduces his hands.\n\"Okay good. You will take some rest. Tomorrow we will discharge you and take you back home\".\nI nod my head relieved that I am going to be away from Dean for a day.\nThe door bursts open with a bang as Dean walks inside with the doctor.",

Maybe if he showed me a little mercy, I would not fulfill the moon goddess' wish but how did she expect me to end his reign?\n\"We are having my father's burial ceremony this evening. So get dressed. Put on something appropriate \"he ordered me. His attention is on his iPad.\nI nod my head in understanding when he says something appropriate it means something that will cover my body marks.\nWe soon reached the palace. Immediately the car stopped at the palace and my face turned white. My lips start trembling. I press it tight to keep it from trembling. The Alpha would not see me fall apart. Never!.\nAll the dreadful memories associated with this night rush back to my head. From the day I made my mistake by entering into the palace. To my rejection, every time I was humiliated and dejected.\nI searched around for Luca. If they are going to bury his uncle he should have released him by now. Dean would surely know how dear his father was to him.\nAs if Dean read my mind he says\"If you are looking for your lover, he is not here\" Dean says with a mocking tone.\nI glare at him. He smiles and looks forward \"Glare at me all you want but he will remain there for a very long time. After all you don't even know where he is kept,\" he says with a smile.\nI open my mouth to ask him why but instead \"It's no use talking to you\" I murmur enough for him to hear me and walk away. I can feel his glare at the back of my neck.\nI walk into my room and slam the door against me. My nostrils flare with anger. I quickly take my bath and put on new clothes.\nI close my eyes as I think of ways to escape from the palace to see my son without the guards following me. \nAs I ponder on my way out, sleep eludes me. \nA knock on the door interrupted my sleep. I roll over to the other side of the bed and check the time. It is already five o'clock.\n\"Come in\" I shouted as I sat upright.\nSasha enters with a smile, my face grows red with anger as I see her. What is she doing here? She dared to show herself after what she did to me.\n\"What are you doing here?\" I asked her.\nShe smiled as she closed the door. \"Oh my Luna I came to get you ready for the party\" she answered in a mocking tone.\nI stare at her face as I think about a thousand ways to kill her without anyone noticing. I still had the gun that Finn gave me under my pillow.\nI could just bring it out and waste her disdainful life but that would make Dean punish me again. And I have to be around to be able to plan his downfall. However, I make it a note that as he is dying she will die with him and so will that twat called Lorenzo.\n\"Drop it so I can dress up by myself\" I ordered.\nShe replied with a smile \"Of course my Luna you can dress up by yourself. No one is going to dress you up but the king has particularly instructed me to make sure you dress up and put on the best makeup\"\nI hiss and stand up and I look at the mirror \"Best makeup indeed. Why don't you just leave me and go and fuck him\"\nShe smiled shyly, a blush appearing on her face \"Oh, that is only done at night. But I am not sure you know after all he has never touched you\" and paused for a while \".He is very good in bed\" she added.\nI smile \"of course. I have been there before you came\" I told her with a smile.\nNo one knows that I have slept with Dean or had a child for him except for Luca. And Luca has promised me his secrecy.\nI sit down on the chair \"Come and give me makeup meant for a Luna and not for a prostitute\" I say and turn to her and watch as her face turns red.\nA moment of silence exists between both of us for a while and I am grateful for that. Until she opens her mouth to talk.\n\"You know Luna. You should not be deceived by the title. You might be Luna but I hold his heart. Just imagine all the pain you passed through because I testified against you.\" She whispers into my ear.\nAnger rushed through me but I replaced it with a smile. I stay silent and watch as she finishes my makeup with a triumphant smile.\nShe stands up and walks toward the door when I stop her \"You should not be so assured about his intention. You are a whore to him. If you should learn something from me, you should learn that Dean does not care about anyone. Now get out \"I ordered her.\nHer face turns red as she opens her mouth to talk \" I said get.out.\" she curls her hand into a fist and slams the door on me.",

I turn to look at her, with a glare \"I am your Luna. I will forever be your  Luna and I will kill you if I want to. I am not the Lia you once knew\" I warn her.\nShe swallows hard, and a glint of fear passes through her eyes. She bows her head \"Yes my lady\" she says.\n\"Good,\" I say and continue walking. By the time I get to the hall. Dean is already standing there waiting for me. I give him a smile In return he glares at me.\nOf course, he is surprised that I am smiling. I don't know what came over me but all I know is that the sight of his bigheaded body gives me great joy.\nHe gives me his hands which I take with a smile and walk towards his seat.\n\"Don't tell me you are planning on doing something stupid,lia. If you do, I will have your head\" he whispers to my ear as we take our site.\nI smile at the crowd as I whisper back. \" Get that idea out of your head. Having my head is not happening. Having my tears will neither happen\"  I warn.\nHe scoffs and chuckles. He glared at me from the hollow of my shoes to my shining crown and looked away.\nHe looks at Lorenzo \"You were late\"\nI shrug with a smile \"I know. It was deliberate\".\nTruly I did not have any strength within me to watch as the Alpha was burned. I wanted the reception. The official announcement of me as Luna.\nDamon, the head of the elder council, signals to both of us to go on our knees as he brings forward the crown.\n\"With the authority bestowed on me I crown you both Dean and Lia as the Alpha and Luna of the pack\"  he announces as he places the crowns on our heads.\nThe crowd cheered on. Dean and I waved at them. I turn to look at Sasha with a smile.\nSooner than later all the Alphas and their Luna came to greet us. Finn and his people were absent.\nOne of the Luna walked up to me with a smile \"May I have a word with you,  my lady\" she asked.\nI nod in approval and walk away. They guarded both of us till we got to the conference room.\n\"We need privacy,\" she says. They nod their heads and walk away.\nImmediately they walked away, the woman turned to me and said.\"In all, you do. Do not shout\" she ordered. I am about to ask her what she was talking about when her skin starts shedding off.\nWhat the f**k!  I exclaim as I stare at Sabrina. I knew witches had power but not this amount of power.\n\"What would you do if you got caught?\" I ask her.\nA smile creeps into her face. \"They will never catch me,lia,\" she says. The smile quickly disappears and is replaced with a frown.\n\"Where is Luca?\" she asks as she walks towards me.\n\"I don't know,\" I answered sincerely. The fact that she is glaring at me makes fear rush within me.\n\"What do you mean you don't know?\" She asks me.\n\"Dean stabbed him with the white oak because he tried to save me. I was locked up afterward. I don't know where he is''\n\"He was stabbed. You were locked up? By who?\" She asks\n\"Dean,\" I answered.\nAnger flashes through her eyes as she searches around me. \"Do you have any marks?\" She asks me.\nMarks?How about I tell her that my skin is red from the pepper that was poured on my skin?\nWithout waiting for my reply. She locks the door and zips my gown. She gasped at the marks on my back that I suffered from the whip.\n\"He did this to you?\" She asks in a shaky voice.\n\"Yes, but I am fine,\" I assure her. I need to ask her to help me remove the oak from Luca.\n\"I need your help. I need to remove the oak from him,\" I said.\n\"Was he around for the Alpha burial?\"\n\"No?\"\nShe heaved a sigh \"What happened?\" She asks. I begin to narrate everything to her, skipping the part of Finn being my mate.\n\"Damn it!\" She shouts as she curls her palm into a fist. \"I told him to be careful!\" She shouts.\nAfter a long time of silence, she says \"I will get it out of him and place it on your bed. You will now hold the white oak. I will also take him out of there so that he can recover quickly\"  she informs me.\n\"Okay. What should I do?\" I ask.\n\"Distract Dean. That's all\" she says with a smile.\nA bang is heard on the door. \"My lady, the woman, is an impostor!\" \"Are you okay?!\" They shout banging at the door.",

The woman was nowhere to be found and you waited for us to break into the room! You have arranged your meeting!\" He shouted. The crowd gasped in surprise.\nI knew what he was trying to do. Getting the crowd to hate me just like he does.\n\"I did not. I did not know who she was\"\n\"Of course you did!\" He shouts\nI scoff and stand up \"How am I supposed to arrange a meeting with a sorcerer when you had me locked up all this while?\" His jaw tightened.\n\"Don't bring this into this issue\"  he growls at me.\nI nodded back \"Oh yes, I will. Since you think everyone is trying to be as evil as you are.\"\n\"I am not evil. You know witches are not  allowed here\"\n\"Locking someone up,  beating a woman up, pouring pepper on her and almost killing her is called what? You did this to me and I did not say anything yet you stand here trying to educate me about what is right or wrong! You are all covered up with evil. You don't know good!\"I shouted back.\nHe glares at me as I take in shaky breaths. Lorenzo clears his throat and we face the crowd.\n\"Let the party begin!\" Lorenzo shouts. The crowd kept quiet for a while looking at the both of us. \nGradually they turn back to their usual business. I am sure the women must be murmuring among themselves. \nI square up my shoulder and sit on my throne. The other co-alphas come forward with their gift.\nA fellow Luna walked up to me with a basket of fruit and other things. \"They are for you,\" she says and puts them down.\nI nod with a smile. \"That's so thoughtful of you,\"I reply with a smile touched by her kindness.\nShe smiles back. \"I must reward you back,\" I say. She furrowed her eyebrow to look at me\n\"What do you mean? \"she asked me. I smiled at her. \n\"Just wait\" I replied \"Sasha!\" I called out.\nSasha rushed towards me acting all naive and submissive. I place my hands on her shoulders \"Take her as my gift to you. Help me watch her. She is my maid but she lied to me. I want you to keep her as a slave to do anything. Just make sure you keep her out of the royalty's bed for she is a slut!\"I say with the last part with much anger.\nSomething shines within Luna's eyes and I am afraid that she would refuse me. Then Sasha would mock me. She smiles at me \"Very well then\" she nods with understanding\n\"No! You can't do that!\" She shouts, drawing everyone's attention including her lover, Dean.\nJust as I planned Dean excuses himself from the men he is talking to and walks towards me with a confident aura. \n\"What are you doing?\" he asks.\n\"She is-\nI raised my hands in the air and shut her up \" I am giving out Sasha as a gift to my fellow Luna\" I replied with a smile well aware of everybody's eyes.\nHe furrowed his eyebrows at me \"What? Who gave you the right?\" He asks, looking at Sasha whose eyes are already filled with tears.\n\"Oh! Don't you remember? You said I could punish her any way I want for lying against me and making you treat me badly\"  I replied with a low pitiful voice.\nHe stared at me as confusion masked his face. I am sure he is trying to unveil what I am planning.\nI have put him at a crossroads. He can't say no. It would make him look bad before his people.\n\"Lia\" he calls out in a low angry voice. I smile and turn to him and hug him. I whisper against his ears \"Try to do anything stupid and I will tell the people what you and her have been doing and how you treated me badly\" he tries to free himself from my grip but I tighten myself around him.\n\"That's not all, my oh my. I will make your people turn against you if you try to ruin my day\"\nHe is silent for a while before he grabs my hair. \"I will make you pay for this\" he whispers back with a voice.\n\"Be my guest\" I replied and stepped back.\nHe clears his throat \"Take her with you\" he says addressing Luna.\nSasha's eyes widened in shock. I smiled at her as I turned to hug her one last time. I whisper into her ear \"See you when I see you\"\nI give a plastered bitter smile at her. The Luna nods and leaves with Sasha\nA bold smile creeps on my face with pride. My eyes gaze round the hall and land on a familiar face with a smirk.\nFinn",

I return it with a smile. I look towards Dean's direction but he is nowhere to be found.\nI search around the crowd with my eyes, he is not there. Was I hallucinating?\nGoosebumps creep into my skin at the thought of our last encounter. How deep his voice was, how soft his hands were, or how clean his chest was.\nI shake my head and steady myself. I can't think of a Finn at this moment although he is my mate.\nSooner than later they start playing classical songs in the background. I have always hated classical songs,  they seemed too boring, and too slow for me and they came with a little melodrama between couples.\nFor those who were in love, they would spend time professing feelings to one another for couples like me and Dean who would rather die than stay in the same room.  It was torture,  cruel torture.\nBut we had to do it. If we did not our people would not be pleased. I was sure he was going to promise me hell for sending his concubine away but it was high time he knew that if he did not allow me to have my peace I would seize his own.\nDean offers me his hands and I take it as we make our way to the centre of the hall prepared for us.\nImmediately we take our bow, we start dancing. He wraps his arms around my waist drawing me closer to his chest. \n\"What do you think you are doing?\" He asks as he leans forward into my ear and whispers.\nI lower my eyebrows feigning ignorance. \"What do you mean my Lord? '' I ask.\nHe hiss \"Don't play dumb with me Lia\" he says as he turns me around.\n\"Maybe if you tried to explain more I would understand what you are talking about\" I replied to him with a smile.\nHis jaw tightened, and he squeezed my waist maybe to cause me pain which was not going to work.\n\"What you did do out there with Sasha\"\n\"Oh!\" I reply with a smile as if I am just remembering what I did. \"I gifted the widowed Luna a gift\" I reply \n\"And it had to be Sasha, hun?\"  he asks.\n\"It could be anybody\"  I reply and add with a mocking voice. \"But I have zero tolerance for prostitutes so I decided to give her out\"\nHe grits his teeth. I can tell I am successfully getting on his nerves. Something I am doing with joy.\n\"You may think sending Sasha away will make me look at you but just know that you are highly mistaken. I would never be drawn to someone like you\" he says.\nHis words pierce me a little, just a little. \"We are on the same spot, Alpha. I too would never be drawn to someone like you but I am your Luna. Like it or not you have obligations to me\" and added \"I would rather die than lay in bed with you\" I reply.\nThe door to the hall opens at once revealing an angry Luca. Our eyes meet for a while and I smile, and he nods.\n\"Dean!\" He shouted his voice echoing round the hall.\nDean halted and looked at me \"What have you done*he ask in a whisper\n\" What do you mean.?\"\n\"How did he get up?\" He asks with a lethal voice and a glaring eye.\nI shrug with a smile \" I don't know \" I reply to him.\nLuca walks towards him, and the guard rushes towards him pointing all sorts of weapons at him.\nHe glares at all of them and at Dean \"Tell them to leave my way or\"\n\"Or what?\" Dean asks as he strolls toward him. \"What will you do? Kill them? But you can't because you are a rogue? And even if you were a wolf, you had too much injury to fight\"\nLuca starts laughing, and to everyone's surprise, he looks at Dean and keeps on laughing for a long time. The guards lower their guns and stare at him.\nIn a split second, he shot one of them. Press one against his chest with a knife pressed to his neck. The people around gasp.\nSooner than later they start leaving the hall one after the other, slowly. \n\"Do anything stupid and I will cut his head off\" he warns breathing heavily.\n\"Luca don't you dear!\" Dean warns. They glare at each other for a while and Dean signals his men to drop their weapon.\nThey drop their arms waiting for him. Surprisingly he slit the head of the man and watched as the skull fell on the floor. \nBlood fills his white shirt and the rug. Everyone immediately leaves. Left with only us and Lorenzo.\n\"That is for daring to use your weaklings to threaten me, \" he says with a smile.\nDean clenches his fist \"What do you want\" he asks.\n\"Nothing,\"  he says and turns to me \"Follow me\" I nod and walk towards him but Dean stops me.\n\"She is my Luna. Not yours\"\nLuca's muscles tighten \"We both know that that is a lie. Let her go or I will do something terrible\" he warns.\nDean let go of my hand, I smiled inwardly as I walked towards Luca.\nI immediately promised myself to give myself out to someone this evening.",

I thought it was a lie, a monster cannot be afraid of anyone until I saw the fear in Dean's eyes today when he threatened to do something stupid.\nI saw the fear in Dean's eyes. Even the monster can be afraid of his creator. I gave one last glance at Dean whose face was laced with fear before I took Luca's hands.\nStill, the men decide to be foolish. As we approach the door they stop us in the hallway. Luca gives them one last glare.\n\"Get out of my way before I send your skin to your beloved families\" one of them trembles as he drops the sword,  the other still pointing their gun towards us. And steadily they increase in numbers forming a circle around us.\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" He asks them.\nOne of them clears their throat \"Alpha Dean has announced that anyone who can kill you will get a higher promotion. He will be the second beta\"\nI roll my eyes. Dean has always been a cunning man but how he was able to make his people cowards too was an unknown myth to me.\nThere was no position as \"Second Beta\" dumbass.\n\"And you think you can kill me?\" He asks with a surprised voice. His muscles tighten. I can't tell if he is scared or surprised that his cousin wants him dead.\nOne of them bursts into laughter, and the rest join him although some of them focus on him with prying eyes.\" of course, you are the rogue\" he says amidst their laughter\nLuca turned to me. I gasp at the color of his eyes \"Go\" he orders.\nI open my mouth to say something but the way he looks at me makes me leave the place.\nOnly that I don't entirely leave, I just hide in a safe place.\nThey rush towards him with their swords and guns. He takes out his gun and starts shooting back but before you know his bullet is finished.\nI resist the urge to run to him and save him,  he is becoming weaker. I wonder why Dean would ask for his death.\nWhat did he do this time?\nI watch with gripping pain in my heart as he gets weaker. He stops fighting. Dean, together with Lorenzo, strolls towards him. His body is covered with blood and cuts.\nHe raises his head to look at Dean \"Why brother?\" He asks with a croaky voice \nDean raises an eyebrow, his side lips lift to a side, and he turns to Lorenzo who is standing at his back\"He just called me brother\" his tone is filled with mockery and anger.\nHe points towards him, his tone  with mockery\"This twat just called me brother?\"\nHe squats to Luca's level \"You were never my brother and your privilege as a royalty died with my father's reign. I am the Alpha. I dictate how things happen in my reign \"\nHe says.\nLuca bursts into laughter, and everyone goes silent. His laughter echoed around the room. \nWhat is also strange is that his laughter is filled with life. Is he not meant to be weak?\nDean together with Lorenzo stares at him as he stands up still laughing, his teeth covered with blood.\n\"Just tell me you are jealous of me. You are not happy that you are never going to be me. Or admit that you get jealous seeing me with your Luna\"\nWhat? What the hell is he saying? Oh,  he does not know what Dean did to me when he was awake. If he did he would not be here?\nDean breaks into laughter, an unhinged one. \"You think I want Lia. Seriously? Do you think I would look after a girl like her? I want you dead because you want me dead not because of some infatuation you have with Lia. She is my Luna and will continue to be one.\"\n\" No, you are just angry because she is the only one who has refused to bow down to you\"\nDean scoffs as he folds his arm \"Did she tell you that? Because if I can recall I almost made her die because she dared to defy me and bring Finn, her mate, into our home which killed our father!\" He shouted.\nIn a split moment Luca rushes to him pulling him by his collar \"You did what?\" He asks.\n\"You heard me. I made her skin bleed!\" He said, staring at Luca.\nWithin a moment Luca drags out the white oak from under his shirt, Lorenzo rushes to meet him but he is too late, he has already stabbed Dean. He watches as Dean turns white and falls to the ground.\nLorenzo rushes to him with range, he drives a blow into Luca's chest but he seems unaffected. He continues raining blows on him until Luca grabs his hand stopping him.\n\"Dean will only rise if he wants to and contrary to mine he does not have any supernatural to help him\" he blurts out.\nLorenzo glared at him one last time,  panting heavily \"I will deal with you!\" He shouts as he storms away.\nLuca turns to the men who bow immediately to him and an evil smile creeps into his face. He pulls out his blood-soaked shirt, gives it to one of them, and walks away in my direction.\nI hide behind the pillars. For some reason, I am scared of Luca right now. I have never seen him this ruthless.\nHe walked past me, and I heaved a sigh. \n\"Tell Lia to see me now!\" he shouts. He is not heading to his room. He is heading to Dean's room.\nFor the time being Lorenzo is going to be in charge. This will give a glimpse of his rule. I walk towards my room and change my clothes.\nMy new maid knocks on my door.\n\"Alpha Luca wants to see you,\" she informs me.\nI give her a light nod and make my way towards Dean's room. This is the first time I will be seeing him.",

The room is so huge and beautiful. What the hell does a man do with so much space?\nMy eyes moved from his big spacious bed covered with expensive beddings to the sandstone table decorated with glass by the side. Different oil paintings hang on the wall by the side of a walk-in closet.\nFinally, my eyes land on Luca who is standing by the large glass window. He is shirtless, he is holding a glass of wine with his left hand and his right hand is tucked into the pocket of his grey sweat pants revealing his masculine physique.\n\"Shut the door\" he orders. His voice is cold and lacks emotion.\nI shut the door behind me and stand at a far distance. A heavy awkward uncomfortable silence exists between us. Tension fills the air.\nWe stay in that position for about three whole minutes. I am tempted to ask him why he called me but with how tense his shoulders are I decide to shut up.\nFinally, he decides to break the silence \"Is it true?\"\nI swallowed whatever fear that gripped me. \"He would not hurt me\" I keep on chanting in my mind. He killed me,  but then again, I lied to him.\n\"What are you talking about?\" I ask in a low voice.\nIn a split second the glass he is holding hits the wall. \"Don't you dare pretend to me or feign ignorance? Is it true?\" He asks as he approaches me,  both hands tucked into his pocket.\n\"Yes,\" I answered. Of course, I know he is asking me about Finn.\nHe halts for a while, a few steps away from me. His eyes darken in anger and so does his voice \"Look at me Lia\" he orders. Even though he is angry,  I can't help but feel the softness with which he used to call my name.\nI raise my head to look at him. I tighten my grip around my clothes as I keep on chanting in my mind \"he won't hurt me\"\n\"Yes,\" I reply in a whisper.\nHis jaw tightened, \"why did you not tell me?\"  he asked.\nI swallowed hard as beads of sweat covered my forehead \"There was no time?\" I answer.\nHe gives a sardonic laugh \"No time?\"\nI nod \"Yes\"\n\"When I met you in the room there was no time? When we were walking to the room, no time? When I came to your fucking bedroom, there was still no time?\" He asks.\nWhat am I meant to say? How do I explain it to him without him feeling angry? I didn't even know who he was when I felt the mate bond. Even when we discussed our way to our room it was an uncomfortable one. He had just informed me that he killed Dean's mother. Should I have told him at that time? Hell no.\nOr when he came to my room? There was no time.\n\"Answer me!\" He shouts at the top of his voice. I flinch in surprise.\n\"I wanted to tell you. I did not just know how to put it.\" I reply with a shaky voice. My eyes are already filled with tears.\n\"Suck in those tears. I don't want to see it roll\" he warns.\nI take in a shaky breath. What have I gotten myself into?\n\"Did you have him in your room the day our Alpha died?\" He asked.\n\"I came to my room and met him. He-\"\n\"Damit!\" He curses under his breath.\n\"I fucking came to you to complain about the same situation\"\n\"Let me explain\" I plead, allowing the tears to finally flow.\n\"I said wipe those tears of yours!\" He ordered.\nI use the back of my hand to wipe them off as I start to explain \"I did not know about his motive. I was hiding when he saw me and our bond connected. He said he would come back for me. After our discussion, I opened my door only to see him there. He said he came to check up on me. I swear I did not know his motive\" I explained with a shaky voice.\n\"You are sure?\"\n\"I will never lie to you\"  I assure him even though I had lied to him.\nHe scoffs\" You have lied to me lia. But let's walk on that?\"  he said.\nI heaved a sigh of relief. He strolled toward me slowly. \"What did you tell him\"\nI swallow hard. I can't tell him that Finn almost kissed me. He will be mad at me. So I decided to lie. I don't see the reason why the moon goddess would decide to trap me between two men.\n\"He said he would come and get me. I told him okay\" I responded.\nHis rough hands circle my neck.  as he leans forward. His musky scent hit my nostrils. He lifts my chin, making me stare at him.\n\"You are my lia and no one can change that\" he growls into my ear.\nShivers run down my spine. He brings his face from my ear back to my face. He stares at me for a while and his eyes move to my lips as his face darkens.\nHis lips land on mine, I stay mobile for a while as my brain tries to process what just happened. He keeps on kissing me as his tongue begs for access. I open my mouth, and his hot breath mixes with mine.\nMy arms willingly wrap around his neck as I deepen the kiss. A moan escapes me. He pulls from me panting as we both gasp for air. \nI expect him to continue but he steps away. I furrow my eyebrow \"Get out.!\" He orders.\n\"What?\" I ask with disbelief. What did I do now?\n\"I. said.get.out\" he shouts.\n\"You can't just kiss me and ask me to leave. That's not how things are done.\" I retorted.\nHe takes a deep breath as he glares at me. \"I said get out,\" he orders.\nI take in soft breaths and leave the room.",

Nobody knew I was around, not even my uncle.\nAfter being sent away for five years I had managed to come back with my full power. To everybody, I was a rogue because when everyone was getting their wolf I was still weak. Like really weak, but with the help of Sabrina I was able to awaken my wolf. Turns out that I am a hybrid. \nMy mother left me immediately after she gave birth to me because somebody had already found out that she was a vampire. She and my dad did not want another person to discover my secret.\nI got to know about this through Sabrina. Then I discovered that Jenny was my mate. She loved me regardless of who I was or my kind. She was the only one who took me for who I was. Then I woke up one morning to discover that she had been killed by one of our bodyguards. When I asked whose orders he said it was Dean\nGosh!  I  wanted to murder him right there but I could not. He was the crown prince and my uncle would not allow me. So when I heard that the bloodlust park had a rivalry with us, I helped them kill his mother.\nCall me fucking wicked but I wanted vengeance. Ever since then my life has been a mess especially when I was sent out of the park. I just wandered around till I met Sabrina who helped me.\nWhen I came back I promised myself to end Dean's miserable life then I found out about Lia and Merlin who was his son.\nThe obsession to have her crept slowly into my skin and I made up my mind that I was going to have her irrespective of who she was. Be it Dean's Luna or Finn's mate,  they could all go to hell.\nAnd if I am being serious I would have fucked her right this instant or called her back to me as I watched her go away but I did not. I had things to attend to. I needed to make sure that Dean remained where he was and most importantly I needed to visit Sabrina or instead send for her.\nAnd so I did.\nLia POV\nI curl my hands into a fist as I storm out of his room. I have never been this humiliated. What the hell was his problem? I ask as I bang the door behind me.\nI pace around the room wondering what I did round.\nMy phone rings. I look at the caller ID. It's Lexie. My heart skips a bit as I pick up the call and hope everything is alright.\nI pick up the call \"Hello Lexie\"\nThe phone is silent for a while before she picks up. \"How are you lia?\" She asks me if her voice sounds low or maybe it's the fear in me.\n\"Am fine. How is Merlin? Is he fine?\" I ask her.\n\"Yes. But he has a little headache. When will you be coming to see him? He has been asking after you\"\nMy heart dropped at the thought of him asking for him. My mother was not present with me when I was growing up because she was dead but I am alive. My son's health is meant to come before anything.\n\"I can come and see him today, or now. If he is awake\" I reply to her without thinking. All that matters is that my son needs me. \n\"Are you sure?\" She asks me her voice laced with doubt.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Okay. He will be waiting\" she says and hangs up the phone.\nI take my bath as I try to wash Luca's hands or scent from me. I put on my clothes, do a little makeup, and close the door behind me.\nAs I pass through the gates I am tempted to tell Luca that I am going to see Merlin but after what happened today. I refuse. After all, he does not care about me. What good will it do if I tell him?\nI make my way toward the car I was gifted at my remating ceremony with Dean. The palace guard don't even bother stopping me, instead, they bow their heads and leave.\nWithin thirty minutes I arrive at Lexie's house. I knock for a while before Lexie opens the door.\n\"Mummy!\" Merlin shouts as he runs to hug me. I squat to his night and engulf him in a tight hug rubbing his hair.\n\"I missed you,\" he said in a low voice as he clung to me tighter.\n\"I missed you too\" I whispered back to him. We stayed in that position for a while.\nI spend a lot of time with Lexie and Merlin. Merlin soon fell asleep leaving me and Lexie to talk.\nAfter a while, I bade her goodbye, kissed Merlin on the forehead, and got into my car.\nImmediately I entered the car, my muscles stiffened. I felt something was wrong. The car smelt different.\nA large masculine hand covered my mouth with a handkerchief. I fought hard to remove it but to no avail. Slowly my eyelid became heavy and I closed my eyes. Welcoming myself to darkness once more.",

I try to move the rope but it is tightly tied. To make things worse my mouth is tied too. Therefore I can speak.\nI lay on the cold tiled floor for a while. Who could have decided to kidnap me? The only enemy I had was Sasha and I made sure I let go of her a long time ago.\nThe door creaked open. Two huge masked men enter inside and turn on the light. The brightness of the light hit my eyes as I shut it.\n\"She's awake,\" one of the men said.  The other white-haired one nodded. He narrowed his eyes to look at me. His eyes travelled from my legs and stopped at my laps which were exposed because of the way I was positioned. He licked his lips. His eyes finally left there and moved to the top.\nThe other one hit him lightly, bringing him back from whatever previous thought going on in his mind.\n\"What do we do?\" He asked.\nThe white-haired one looked at me and then at him then back to me. A smile crept on his lips.\n\"Boss said we should wait,\" he said and looked at me again \"But I think that we torture her. Boss might add to our pay,\" he said, licking his lips.\nFear crept into me. My body became cold. Don't tell me that I am about to be raped. \n\"Mmm,\" I said as I tried to make them untie me. I struggled on the floor trying to loosen the rope that was around my waist.\nThe white-haired one moved to me with an eerie smile and squatted before me. He raised his hands to my face and I drifted backwards. His hands stopped in the air \"I don't like stressing myself, Lia\" he warned saying my name with anger.\nI stayed still, my heartbeat fastened as his warm hands caressed my cold cheek. \"Do you want to talk?\" He asked me. His eyes dropped down to my mouth.\nI nodded quickly. Maybe if I could tell them that I was the Luna they would release me.\n\"What would it benefit us if we release you? Don't you know that your gender has a specialty in nagging and talking?\" he asked.\nI shook my head. His eyes bore into mine instilling fear. What if they end up killing me?\nHe moved to my back and untied my mouth. I gasp in relief. He stood up and threw the bind to me.\n\"Please release me. I will pay you. I am Luna of Attic Pack. We have money to give you\" I pleaded, my voice breaking at the end as I choked on my tears.\nThe white-haired one gave the other one a signal. He nodded and left while the white-haired one fixed his eyes on me. He came back minutes later with a can of water.\nMy throat watered at the sight. I was thirsty and tired. As if he sensed my thirst he asked \"Do you want water?\"\nI nodded my head. He opened the can and bent before me. Fear gripped me. What if the water was poisoned? But I am thirsty and I might even die at the end. It would be a shame to die thirsty.\nI opened my mouth for him to pour in the content. He smiled, and immediately the liquid touched my mouth and I spat it out on his face. \nIt was not water. It was vinegar and it was excessively bitter. I glared at him. \"What was that for?\" I asked.\nI mean how would you not be able to give someone a little amount of water? He stood up and answered me \"That's for thinking you would be able to buy us with your position and loyalty\"\n\"Boss is here\" the other one announced. The white-haired one nodded and brought a chair for him and placed it in front of me.\nI swallowed hard. Waiting to see my enemy. He walked inside a few minutes later. He was wearing grey sweatpants and a white hoodie with a black face mask. \nHe looked familiar. The eyes, the face, the scent, even the godforsaken aura. He sat on the chair provided for him as he removed his hoodie and face mask.\nAdrenaline rushed within me at the person who had kidnapped me. Blonde hair,  sleepy eyes, and dull green eyes. Lorenzo.\n\"Lorenzo?\"I asked. Anger gushed through me. What the hell? What was this for?\n\"Lia,\" he replied. His voice is low and smooth. I had always taken him for a fool until this moment.\n\"What is this about?\" I asked my voice sharp to the edge as I glared at me.\nA smile tugged at the side of his lips \"Believe me, it's nothing personal. I just want to convince your lover to release my best friend\" he explained.\nAn 'o 'left my mouth. So this was meant to make Luca remove the white oak from Dean. Well, unfortunately for him Luca is not interested in me. Because he asked me to leave his room\nI hissed \"is a wasteful effort. Luca does not care about anyone but himself\" I said.\nHe sat upright. \"You and I know that is a lie,\" he said as he brought out his phone and took photos of me.\nI furrowed my eyebrows \"What do you think you are doing?\" I asked\n\"Sending your photo to your lover\" he replies to me with a smile.\n\"We got your girl\" he read as he typed.\n\"This is not going to make Luca remove the dagger from Dean,\" I said.\n\"Well, I will say you pray he removes it. The more my best friend remains there. The more I will torture you\" he warned.\nHe stood up and tucked his phone into his pocket and strolled towards the door. He stooped and looked at them as they bowed their heads.\n\"Once you receive my call, start the torturing. Introduce her to the real meaning of pain\" he said and left.",

        "content": "Luca POV\nI sigh heavily as my heartbeat increases. Lia's face and laughter fill my head. I drive my punching gloves into the bag. I have been boxing for over an hour now. \nI am seriously meant to be exhausted but I am not. I increase my pace, punching and punching trying to drive every anger and feeling into the bag.\nAn effort that fails miserably.\nI should never have started anything with Lia. I should have stayed clear from her and her son. \nFuck! I shouted as I drove my hand into the punching bag. To think that she has been occupying my mind for the past few hours.\nA knock on the door stops me from my boxing session. \n\"Come in\"  I ordered. The door opens slightly revealing a bodyguard. He bows his head \n\"Sabrina is around\" he informs me. I nod my head slightly. He walks away after bowing to me.\nI heaved a sigh of relief. I walk towards my chambers and change my clothes to the royal Alpha clothes with a smile on my face.\nI make my way towards the sitting room. Sabrina smiles immediately when she sees me in the royal robe.\n\" Royalty suits you,\" she says with a smile as she bows her head. I know she does not mean it. Sabrina has never bowed to anyone, even my father.\nWe move towards our respective chairs and sit. A maid comes in later to serve her drinks and food. She thanks her and starts eating.\n\"So how fun is it being a leader?\" She asks me about her eating.\nI smile evenly tapping my hands on the throne arm. I gulp down my breath to stay quiet. I have to keep putting her in a good mood before I bring forth my intentions.\n\"It's fine. Everyone seems to be complying although I have not made an official announcement\" I say.\nShe scoffs and rests her back on the chair \"It's a lie. The news is everywhere\" I ask.\nI furrow my eyebrows \"How?\". I mean It has not been long since I took over.\nHer smile grows wilder\"Never underestimate the power of gossip\" she says.\nShe clears her throat \"When are you going to ask my kind to return to their land\"\n\"As soon as I get crowned. After all, you are the one who put me in this position\" I replied with a smile.\nShe nods her head with a smile. Her blue eyes shine wilder \"good\"\nI take in a shaky breath. Is time to make my request. \"I kissed Lia\"\nShe pauses to look at me. Her eyes widened with shock. She drops her glass of juice on the table.\n\"Are you serious?\" She asks. Her voice was on the edge.\n\"Yes,\" I reply, waiting for her to lash out. Falling for Lia has never been the plan.\nShe takes a deep breath and plasters a smile although her blue eyes darken. \" That was never the plan, Luca\"\nI sigh heavily as I rub my forehead. \"I know but I could not help it.\"I pause for a while to see her reaction. \"I want her out of our plan\"\nShe raises her eyebrow\"Only her?\" She asks.\n\"Her and her son, of course,\" I add.\nSabrina was the one who told me about Merlin and Lia. She was meant to use her as a medium to get to Dean and kill all of them thereby making me the Alpha.\nI would in turn become the next Alpha and bring the witches. Then I set my eyes on Lia's milky skin and blue enchanting eyes. I just made up my mind to have her.\n\"No Luca. This was not the plan\" she replied quietly with a low voice.\n\"I -\" I began\n\"End it\" she replied with a voice of reproach. Her voice was at the edge.\nI closed my eyes. Gosh! Witches were a pain in the ass. Although she was the one who saved me from being kept in the room with Dean.\n\"I am saying we can handle them without ending Lia and Merlin. I can't hurt her, Sabrina\" I explained.\nHer eyes reduce to a split then her eyes widen \"Oh my god. You have fallen for her\" she says more of a statement than a question.\nI shrug.\"I won't say fallen\". My mind goes back to her pale face when I told her to get out of my room. When she arrives I am going to have to explain even though I don't have an explanation, or I don't know how I would explain myself to her understanding.\nHow do I tell her that I was meant to destroy her, to kill her and her son, and ended up falling for her? If I should let her know about my plan she would never look at me the same way.\nShe might slip out of my hands into Finn's hand. That is something I cannot bear to see.\nMy gaze rises to her eyes. \"Her son is a threat to us. If Dean discovers that she has a son with him he will not let her go. If he dies he will become the next Alpha and not you. Don't you want your blood to sit on the throne?\" She asks.\nI nod weakly. \"Good, then she must go\"\nI shake my head \"No, Sabrina. I can't\"\n\"You have to or else I will turn my back against you\" she warns me. Her eyes darken. \nMy phone peeps with a message notification. I tab on it. My skin turns pale, and my heart drops for a while.\nLia has been kidnapped.\nWhat the fuck? How did she go out without telling me?\n\"What happened?\" She asked, seeing the worry on my face.\n\"Lia has been kidnapped\"",

Who could have done that? \nI look at my phone and click on the sender's contact. It's Lorenzo. Anger brewed within me as I clenched my fist.\nOf course, I knew the cunning bastard would do anything to make me release Dean. And I thought Lia was in her room. How come I never noticed that she went out?\nWorse still is how she went out without telling me.\nFuck! I screamed. What was I going to do? If I bring Dean back because of Lia ,Sabrina would not be on my side again because she has already told me to see her as collateral damage. A means to an end.\nSabrina's voice brings me back from my thoughts \"Don't tell me you are thinking of saving her?'' she asks, glaring at me.\nI squirm in the chair as I try to roll off the agitation on my shoulder. An effort I am sure I am failing miserably at. \n\"I have to save her\" I reply to her with a low yet strong voice.\nI expect her to insult me for trying to save her. After all, she is a witch. She might just use her powers to trap me.\nMy mind goes back to the picture they sent to me. Her hands tied, her eyes tied, her eyes filled with dry tears. I shook my head. I have to save her. I can't let her go.\n\"Who?\" She asks with a sharp tone.\n\"Lorenzo,\" I replied.\n\"And you are still thinking of going to save her? He will make sure you remove the white oak from Dean's body before he releases her!\" She shouted \n\"I know. You think I don't know about the risk involved but I can't just let them hurt her\" I explained.\nShe cocked her head to the side and folded her arms. Her eyes came back to me holding a dark note.\n\"So what do you want to do?\" she asked me.\nI stand up and walk towards her as I explain\"I will try to save her myself. Only I can remove the oak. If I can outsmart them I can release her and come back\" \nThe corner of her lips lifted \"And how do you intend to do that?\" She asked.\nI smiled \"I am a hybrid, Sabrina. Or have you forgotten? I can take them on my own\" I reassured her.\nShe took a step closer to me and I immediately knew that she was going to say something spiteful. Her middle finger poked my chest as she spoke.\n\"Here's what you do not know, you dump fool. If you go there they will leave Lia at gunpoint till you release her and if you don't they will kill her. I will be happy if it is executed because you seem to have a delicate part for her \"She took a step away from me and took her glass of juice.\nWhatever she said was true. If I didn't do it that way, they could kill her and I would not be able to do anything. I ran my hands through my hair.\nWhat the hell was I going to do? I turned to Sabrina as my eyes softened. \"You have to help me,\" I pleaded with her.\nShe choked on the juice and then coughed then smacked her chest. \"What?\" she asked with raised eyebrows.\nI am sure she must have insulted me or called me names in her mind. Worse still she would be regretting why she even tried to ally with me.\n\"Sabrina please\" I pleaded. I can't imagine pleading with someone over a girl I pushed out of my room.\nEverything boils down to me. If I had not pushed her away she would be here or be on my bed and not in the hands of cruel Enzo.\nShe drank in her remaining juice ensuring to make a throat sound. She looked at me \"You are pathetic\" she said and dropped the glass.\nShe glanced at me once more from my head to my toe and left.\nI heaved an exasperated breath as she left. Frustration brewed through me as I watched her leave.\nTo hell with her and her opinion. I am going to save her and there is nothing she can do about it.\nAnother message notification popped up on my phone. Another video from Lorenzo. They placed Lia inside a bath filled with ice. Her skin had turned pale but that did not annoy me. What annoyed me was the fact that she was naked. He had stripped her naked. They poured another bucket of ice on her and she flinched a little bit. It was obvious that her body was getting cold.\nI bit my bottom lip till it drew blood. I had to save her but I did not know Sabrina's mind. She could decide to help Dean when I am gone.\nI shook my head and rushed towards my room and picked up my car keys and my gun. I rushed down to meet a maid waiting for me at the end of the stairrail.\nShe bent her head \"Alpha you have a letter\" she said.\nI furrowed my eyebrows. Who on earth sent letters wrapped in envelopes when there was a phone to send anything?\nI grabbed it from her hand and opened it. Maybe it was from Lorenzo. Did the twat not get tired of sending photos and videos?\nMy jaw dropped as I opened the photo. It was Sabrina, her hands were about Dean's chest as if she was doing an incantation to release him.\nI turned to the back to see the note she left \"The moment you step outside I will release him and I will turn against you\" she warned.\nWhat.the.hell?\nI dashed upstairs,  towards the room where I kept Dean. I barged into the room. She stood there saying some incarnation.\n\"Stop!\" I shouted at her.\nA smile tugged her lips as she dropped her hands.",

To make me a sacrificial lamb for my kind to live. Because I knew one thing for sure and that is Luca would not give up Dean for me. \nHe asked me out of his room,  he was just using me as a pawn just like Dean said. And the foolish me ended up having feelings for him.\nGosh! I can believe how foolish I was to ever imagine that he was going to love me. For crying out loud I was not even his mate.\nSomething moves in the darkness drawing my attention. Fear gripped me as my feet became colder. What the hell was that?\nDid it come again? This time closer than before.\n! My heart sank into the depths of my chest. Don't tell me it was a snake. Then it came crawling towards my leg around my skin.\n\"Help!\" I screamed. \"Somebody help me!\" I screamed again as fear gripped me again.\nI can't die like this. I can't leave Merlin alone in this world.\nSomething sharp pressed through my arm \"!\"\nIt removed his teeth and slowly left my body. My eyelids become heavy. I tried to stay awake but I could not. I gradually closed my eyes and welcomed myself to a more comforting darkness.\nA cold liquid touched me. I opened my eyes slowly. My eyelids feel heavy. I shook my head as I tried to remember everything that happened.\nI looked around me, my hands and legs were untied. I was in a bathtub not just in the bathtub I was naked. Like completely naked.\nWho the hell put me in here? The door opened as Lorenzo and the two other guys entered. They carried a bucket filled with ice. What were they about to do to me?\nLorenzo stood by the side of the tomb, his right hand tucked into his pocket. \"Your lover refused to pick up my calls or answer me\"\nI shrugged. It was not a new thing. Although a small part of me hoped that he would come for me.\n\"I told you, he does not care about anyone\" I replied nonchalantly.\nHe nodded with a smile \"Yes, I know. That is why I am going to make you suffer as my friend is suffering right now\" he replied, his voice laced with disdain. He poured the remaining drink on my breast.\nMy nipples tightened with fear. Shame breeds within me. The fact that he had stripped me naked before the three of them. Different thoughts ran through my mind. Was he going to rape me, or kill m?? Was it going to be a gang rape?.  For crying out loud, why should I suffer for the aims of others?\n\"Lorenzo, please. You can't just keep me here\" I pleaded, my voice shaking with fear \nHe nodded \"Of course I can and I will keep you here,\" he said and turned to them.\n\"Make sure you torture her till she passes out,\" he told them.\n\"Yes boss\" They nodded and he walked away.\nThe white-haired one carried a bucket of ice and poured it into the bathtub. The other one joined him. Soon the whole bathtub was filled with ice.\nI knew what they were trying to do. They were trying to make me freeze till death like those in the Titanic.\nSeriously I wished I was in there rather than being here. At least they were allowed to run. They sat before me watching me.\nOne of them brought out a cigarette. Oh no! How the hell was I going to tell them that I was asthmatic? I am sure they knew, that was why they did it.\nHe brought out his lighter and turned it on. Soon the smoke filled the air. At first, I seized my breath, then I released it. Seizing my breath was another way to die.\nHe smiled at me. My nostrils started blocking. I found it hard to breathe as I gasped for breath. The ice on my body made it worse. It seemed as if my blood had stopped flowing.\nMy skin turned pale. I took in a shaky breath as my chest hurt the more \"Please, can you take it outside\" I pleaded.\nHe stooped for a while and raised his eyebrows. \"Why?\"\n\"I am..am asthmatic\" I replied.\nHe glanced at me and turned away. He took in a Long deep breath and exhaled. I watched as the plume of smoke came out.\nMy gasping increased. I tried to stand up but he pointed a gun at me. \"Don't you dare take a step?\" He warned sternly.\nThe other tapped him, and they communicated through their eyes. He stood up and left me there.\nI heaved a sigh of relief as he left although the smell was still there. The other one opened the window.\n\"Thank you,\" I said with gratitude.\nHis jaw tightened as he replied to me \"Don't be\" he said and sat down back.\nBy this time my feet had become numb.    I could not feel my feet again. The cold came with pain and when I mean pain I mean a great deal of pain.\nMy skin had already turned white. The other guard came inside but he was not with a cigarette.\nHe sat down facing me. His eyes were hollow and emotionless.\n\"Stand up\" he ordered.\nFinally! I mustered. I tried to stand up but fell back into the bathtub. My body was stiff. I could not move.\nHe stood up and carried me from the tub and placed me on the ground.\nI lay there naked and cold.",

Can't believe she was about to release Dean. Of all the people, Dean!\n\"And you decided to make your next ally my brother?\"\nShe nodded \"Yes\"\nI scoffed and turned around the room for a while. I stopped a few meters away from her, my hands on my waist as I called on patience. Because I could seriously snap this woman's neck.\n\"Are you serious? My brother! Dean who has insisted that the witches are not meant to be human? You decide to raise him to destroy me. Seriously Sabrina, what the fuck is wrong with you?\" I asked my voice above the rooftop. I took in shaky breaths as I tried to control my anger, I could feel my veins throbbing.\nHer face turned into a little frown. She pointed her fingers towards me, her eyes dark \"Firstly you do not shout at me. Secondly, I would make anybody my ally since you decided to be a disappointment\"\nI narrowed my eyes to a split, my voice dark with range \"Me? A disappointment?\" I asked.\nShe rolled her eyes, increasing the anger within me. How on earth did I not see this side of her?\n\"Yes my Alpha\" she replied, her tone laced with mockery as she mockingly bowed to me.\nI scoffed \"Me an imbecile. Have you taken a good look at yourself?\"I asked.\nAnger passed through her. \"What do you mean?\" She asked.\nI shrugged and took a step back \"You know what I mean\" I replied.\n\"I am trying to save you, Luca. I am trying to make you the Alpha you have always dreamt of. With Lia and Merlin, you will never be the Alpha. Your blood will never be the heir\" she replied her voice low as she tried to make me see reasons with her.\n\"It doesn't matter if my son sits there if it's not Lia's son. So let me save her.\" I pleaded and moved towards her and held her arms \"She will die if we don't help\" I pleaded.\nShe stared at me for a while and gradually removed my hands from her arms. \"If you cross this gate, I will turn my back against you\"\nI swallowed her threat \"If you turn against me. You and your kind will suffer especially if Dean gets to know that you helped me\" I replied.\nWe glared at each other for a while, our eyes screaming anger and rage. She walks away and bangs the door behind her.\nI take one more glance at Dean and lock the door with my key. I have already been able to track Lia's location.\nI hurry downstairs and get into my car to drive to her location.  What if Sabrina comes in and helps Dean while I am away? What will I do? I ask myself.\nFor a minute I am tempted to stay back and heed Sabrina's warning but then Lia's face flashes through my mind. Her blue eyes, her laughter, her soft lips. Gosh! I tighten my grip around my steering as heat well up through my body.\nI stretched a little to relieve myself of whatever tension that had flowed to my groin.\nI pack my car at the location. It is surprising a modern building unlike most of the kidnappers who hide their victims in creepy, cobwebbed places. \nI step outside and move towards the building holding my gun. I push the gate open and it opens.\nCold creeps into me. Why do I feel like this is a trap? I ask myself.\nThe building is two-storied. I don't even know what floor she is on. Gosh! This feels like a mistake. \nI decide to follow my guts, I can already feel eyes on me. The only reason why I came alone was because I knew that this was what they wanted. Unknowingly to them I am a hybrid, I cannot be killed.\nImmediately I entered the door shut behind me. I turn around to face Lorenzo who has a cigarette trapped in between his lips. He has an amused smirk on his face.\nHe inhales for a while before he exhales \"You know I told Lia that you were going to come and she said no. She called you a selfish person who did not love her. But here you are\" his tone is lacking with mockery.\nMy heart drops at the thought of those words. Did she think that about me?\nLorenzo's eyes changed into gold color as his teeth drew out. I burst into laughter. For fuck sake he is a wolf, I would tear him apart in one bite.\nHe jumps on me and bites me on my neck. \"Argh,\" I wrote in pain. I roll over making him be on top of me.\nI growl as my eyes change into gold and red. His eyebrow furrows as he takes in his teeth \"You are a hybrid?\" He asks. His voice was laced with surprise.\nI tilt my head \"Surprise?\" I asked him and bit his neck. He screamed harder, two men in black who I immediately guessed were lia kidnappers rushed downstairs and started shooting at me.\nI don't flinch but focus on Lorenzo making sure I inflict more pain on him. When I am done drinking some of his blood I leave him, even though I am thirsty for more.\n\"Now tell me where she is?\" I ask him.\nHe points upstairs. Without wasting time I rush up to meet Lia. I open the first door, which is a bedroom. I burst into all the rooms and to the last one which is a bathroom.\nLia is lying on the floor unconscious. Her skin is pale and worst of all she is naked. My eyes move to the bathtub beside her which is filled with ice. Let it not be what I am thinking.",

The two men stood at my front pointing the gun around the room.\n\"Did you hear the scream?\" The white-haired one asked.\n\"Shh,\" the other one signaled to him as they kept quiet.\nWho could have made that noise or maybe they had other captives. I sat up and looked over my naked body. I did not try hiding my body. I am sure they must have seen enough.\nThe groan came again. This time it was louder. They rushed downstairs leaving me on the wet cold floor. Gunshots followed. I am sure whoever tried to break through their house would not survive this because the bullets they fired were many.\nThe bullet was followed by a loud silence from both sides. After a while, I heard a heavy footstep approaching. It was likely to be a man.\nI prayed whosoever found them did not get me. Maybe another enemy or someone who wanted Luna dead. \nThe door opened and he walked inside and searched around the room before he made his way to the bathroom.\nThe door creaked open and I closed my eyes as fear overtook me. Then the scent hit my nose, I don't think I can ever forget that scent. So masculine and addictive.\nI felt him walk towards me, his Shadow hovering around me. He knelt before me immediately and his hand touched me. I shivered.\nHe cupped my cheek hitting me a little \"Lia!    Lia open your eyes\" he said with a low desperate pleading voice.\nI opened my eyes to meet his tear-stained eyes. Why did he come? I mean it is not like he cares for me or anything. Or maybe he needed me to fulfill my duty as his Luna.\n\"Lia. Lia, are you okay?   he asked. His voice is deep with concern or maybe a fake concern. I sat upright. He shook my head.\n\" Answer me. Say something\" he pleaded.\n\"I'm fine,\" I said and sat up. He heaved a sigh of relief. \n\"You scared me, ''he said in a hoarse voice. I raised an eyebrow. There was no need for pretense. We both knew he felt nothing for me. I tried to stand up with the little strength I had but fell back to the floor.\nI looked at Luca, he looked older and his mouth was stained with blood. \"Where are your clothes? Did they hurt you?\" he asked as he searched around.\n\"I don't know. I am sure it will be so were around\"\nHis eyes searched around the bathroom but it was not there. He dashed to the room and soon came back with the clothes.\n\"Can you wear it alone?\" he asked.\nI glared at him. Even if I could not wear it alone I would never allow him to touch me, not after what he did. He was the one that made them kidnap me. If he was around none of this could have happened.\n\"I need to change?\" I told him with a weak cold voice.\nHis face was washed with sadness. He took one final step at me and left. I took my time to wear my clothes. I leaped outside to meet him at the door wearing a worried face.\nHe moved forward to help me but I raised my palm to the air signaling him to stop. \n\"Lia are-\nThe door burst open with the men. They rushed towards me. One wrapped his arms around my neck as he pointed a gun toward my head. \nFear crept into me. Don't tell me I am about to die. I thought he had already taken care of them before coming to get me.\nLuca glared at Lorenzo. Lorenzo returned his glare with a smile. \"Let her go,\" Luca warned.\nLorenzo burst into laughter, he kept on laughing as he pointed fingers at Luca. He stopped for a while and continued laughing then his expression turned cold. His eyes were emotionless.\n\"You must be a fool to think that you can order me around. It is either you release Dean or we kill her\" he said.\nLuca's hands balled into a fist. He growled loudly as his eyes turned into two different colors. He advanced towards Lorenzo. They fought for a while until Luca took over his weight on top of LLorenzo and punched him.\nThe men had already wasted all their bullets towards them. He advanced the other one and bit his neck, sucking his blood as the boy writhed in pain. \nBy the time he was done. The other one faced him with fear. His eyes widened as his skin grew pale. He rushed towards the door but Luca outsmarted him. Luca snapped his neck and drank his blood as he did to the other one.\nAdrenaline rushed within me at the sight of this man. His eye gradually changes back to its usual color, blood still dripping off him.\nThe thought of who he was scared me but the thought that he had shown his true nature because of me warmed my heart.\nHe advanced towards me breathing heavily, his white shirt soaked with blood.\nHe looked at me as his eyes softened. He cupped my cheek and this time I did not flinch. I let his warm hands warm my face.``Look I am sorry for my reaction earlier on and I know you have every right to be mad at me but I am deeply sorry\"  he apologized.\nI nodded. \"Is okay,\" I replied. I don't think I can ever be angry with this side of Luca.\nHe stared at me for a while as if he tried to read my expression then in a split moment he carried me to the car. \nA few seconds passed, his eyes fixed on the road. \"You are a reaper?\" I said more of a question.\nHis muscles tightened. He looked at me and then at the road. \"Yes. I discovered it when I turned into a hybrid,\" he said.\nI nodded \"Does Dean know?\" I asked.\n\"No, he did not know but I am sure he will know now. Lorenzo will tell him once I release him\"  he said.\nSo in conclusion, Luca was a hybrid, and not just a hybrid he was a reaper. A very dangerous combination.\nImmediately we entered I felt an uneasy feeling. We entered the parlor. My jaw dropped.\nDean sat on the throne with Sabrina by his side.\nLuca laughed. \"Seriously?\" He asked. I was sure his question was directed at Sabrina but why?\nA guard stabbed Luca, he shouted with great pain as he fell.\nI looked at Luca and then at Dean and I immediately knew I was in great trouble and no one was going to save me.",

We all know he is soulless. How dare he try to stab me. \nI searched around for Lorenzo. I have been looking for him since I returned. \n\"Lia, what's wrong? You look worried\" Sabrina said as she walked towards Lia. She reaches out to Lia but she takes a step back. I tilt my head, I thought they were friends because she supported her when I rejected her.\nWhat made Sabrina release me is something I don't know about. I think she wants to propose an alliance. Something I will eagerly accept.\nShe places her hands on her chest \"It's me, Lia. Are you okay?. Did Luca do something to you?\" She asked, her voice laced with pretense. \nLia nods slightly and walks away.

She nods her head at the maid and watches her leave.\nShe raises her glass in the air towards me with a smile. I nod at her. She takes in a sip of the juice with a plastered smile.\n\"It seems your brother has done something wrong to his love interest\" \nI scoff and resist the urge to roll my eyes. \" He is not my brother,\" I replied. I am sure she knows he is not my brother. She just wants to get on my nerves.\nShe playfully taps her head \"Oh, my bad\" she replies with an eerie smile. \nSilence exists between us for a while. Just her sitting on a chair by my side with her legs crossed sipping wine and staring at me.\nI clear my throat as I decide to break the silence \" What do you want from me, Sabrina?\" I ask my voice deep with seriousness.\nShe smiles at me and takes down the remaining wine in her glass with a gulp before facing me. \"I will help you destroy your cousin. In turn, you would let all the witches come back to the Attic land\" she says.\nI shake my head \"It's park Sabrina, it is for wolves and not witches\" I retorted my voice deep with anger.\n\"If you walk with me it will be for the benefit of both of our kind\" she replied.\n\"Witches don't have a kind. You all are evil. You don't have a kind\" I reply to her with a glare.\nHer eyes darken and for a moment I thought she was contemplating the best way to kill me. \"I saved you, Dean. You owe me a favor, \" she replied.\n\"I am your Alpha, Sabrina\" I reply, pronouncing the Sabrina softly \"I owe you no favor\" I reply.\nShe stands up immediately, her voice deep with anger \"I will take you back to where I met you if you dare me\" she warned.\nI chuckle \"Well, unfortunately. You can't stab me while I am alive \"\n\"You are forgetting that we are witches. I will search through you and find your weak point. I am from old magic and if I wish I will make you ridiculed by all men\" she warns meaning every word she says.\nI swallow hard at the thought of her threat. If she could remove a white oak from my chest she could do anything.\nThat reminds me, the guard had complained that they did not see her enter. Could she have used magic too? My father had always warned me that witches are the most powerful creatures.\nThey can make or break you. But they hated wolves. I am sure they love vampires more than us. Having an alliance on her side would be beneficial for my reign.\nIt would help me get rid of Luca easily. But what if she turns her back against us just like they did to my father?\nI raise my head to meet her glare \"I will think about it\" I reply to her.\nA smile tugs on her lips as she bows and leaves. Just when she is about to go, Lorenzo walks inside blood-stained. His neck had been bitten.\n\"Lorenzo,\" Sabrina says with a smile. Lorenzo looks at her for a while or maybe for too long. She turned to me with a smile. \n\"I will be on my way\" Immediately she leaves and I turn to Lorenzo. I stand up and walk towards him.\n\"Who bit you?\" I asked. The skin is already swollen. My eyes widened in shock, he was bitten by a hybrid. Hybrid bites are poisonous but I thought my father made sure he erased all the hybrids.\nHe shakes his head, his eyes shaking as if he is confused. \"I can't remember,\" he said.\nI furrow my eyebrow. \"What do you mean by\" you can't remember,\" I ask.\n\"What was Sabrina doing here?\n\" Don't skip the question, who bit you?\n\"Answer me, Dean. What is she doing here\" he asked with a sharp tone.\nSensing his anger I answered him \"She released me from Luca's stab. In return, she asks \"I bring back the witches\". I answer his question.\n\" And?\"\nWhy Is he so bent on knowing about Sabrina? Is not like I ever lie to him about something. \"I told her that I would think about it,\" I replied.\n\"Don't even try thinking about it. She does not mean well\" he replied.\nI lower my eyebrow. How does she not mean well? I mean, I just told him that she released me. The least he can do is to be happy.\n\"Why?\" I ask.\nHe raises his head to look at me \"Immediately I stared at her, my memory vanished including the memory of the hybrid who bit me\" he replies and walks away.\nWhat the hell is Sabrina up to? and who could be the hybrid?",

        "content": "Dean's POV.\nI paced around the room trying to unveil whatever she was hiding and who could be a hybrid. Hybrids are more powerful than wolves and they sometimes turn into tyrants and decide to challenge the throne. The fact that she has decided to wipe Lorenzo's memory means that the person can be of harm to us.\nBut if I don't get her on my side it will be worse and I will never get to know about her plans or who the hybrid is.\nSooner than later I settle down to face more pressing problems such as the administration of the pack and how I am going to have a second chance mate.\nA knock came on my door interrupting my work. I am sure it is Lorenzo. I had sent someone to knock on his door but he had refused to reply, meaning he wanted to be left alone.\n\"Come in\" I shouted, my attention still fixed on the paper in front of me.\n\"My lord, Sabrina is here\" he informs me.\nI furrow my eyebrows, what the hell is she doing here? I had not sent for her. I shrug, let me hear whatever she wants to say.\n\"Let her in\"\nThe guard nods his head and leaves. A few minutes later Sabrina walks in with a smile on her face, an expression I am beginning to find annoying. How can you be evil and keep on smiling?\nShe takes a seat without me asking her to sit. My face turns into a frown as I stare at her.\n\"What do you want, Sabrina?\" I ask. \"I don't remember sending for you\"\nShe shrugs and picks up a pen on my desk \"Well I did not think that there would be a need to inform my ally that I am coming to see him\" she says\n\"We are not yet allies, Sabrina and I don't think we will ever be\" I warn her,   her over-familiarity is beginning to itch my skin.\nHer smile washes away immediately and it is replaced with a frown. \"What do you mean?\" She asks me.\n\"You heard me Sabrina, I said I would think about your proposal\"\nShe swallowed whatever lump was in her throat and sat upright, her hands placed on my table and I resisted the urge to remove her hands. \"What do you say about my proposal?\" She asked.\nI pack up all the paper, close my laptop, and walk toward her side. I sit on the edge of the table beside her. \"I will only agree on one condition\"\n\"What is that?\" She asks.\n\"You tell me who is the hybrid who bit Lorenzo\" I reply with a deep note.\nShe furrowed her eyebrows ``And how am I meant to know who that is?\" She asks me.\nMy muscles tighten as I try to control the anger that is growing within me. How can she look me in the eyes and play dumb?\n\"Lorenzo can't remember the person who bit him and according to him he said its memory faded when you looked at him\"  I explained to her.\nShe stares at me keenly for a long period and it is becoming creepy. My frown deepened \"Why are you staring at me?\" I ask.\nShe shrugs and leans against the chair \"Do you remember what we last discussed?\" She asked.\n\"Yes, why?\"\n\"Oh, nothing. I was just wondering how my eyes remove someone's memory. I mean that question should be directed at you supernaturals. Wolves and vampires are the ones who can erase memory. Not a witch like me.  Witches walk with charms and most of the time the charms can't work if I don't do some incarnation. Did you see me doing any incarnation?\" She asks with a raised eyebrow.\nMy mouth immediately ran dry. I opened my mouth to reply but closed it back. I know she is trying to deceive me.\n\"Lorenzo can't lie\" I reply with a firm voice depicting my trust in him.\nShe chuckled a little bit. \"Is this a way to refuse my alliance?\"  she asks with a frown.\n\"Well-\nThe door burst open. Lorenzo entered inside. Immediately he sees Sabrina, his face turning into a frown as he glares at me.\nSabrina turned to him with a smile \"Oh Lorenzo, I heard you claimed I removed your memory\"\nEnzo looks at me with the thought that it was meant to be between us. I shrugged, I mean what did he expect me to do?\n\"Yes. You wiped my memory about the hybrid\" he replied, shooting me with a death glare.\n\"Ahh, how are you sure that it was a hybrid that bit you? Why do you think I would want to erase a memory of a hybrid?\" She asks with a calculated calmness.\n\"I don't know. You always have personal ambition Sabrina and even if you can deceive Dean you can't deceive me\" he replied the last part with a deep warning.\nAnger flashes through her eyes \"I saved your friend and for some reason, you think I want your downfall\" she asks.\nLorenzo rolled his eyes as he tried to control whatever anger he was feeling. \"Sabrina, an alliance with you is impossible.\"\nShe turns to me \" Are you going to let your beta make decisions for you?\" she asks.\nI look at Lorenzo who is staring at me with a dare-devil eye. I walk back to my chair and stare at the two options before me.\nAn alliance with Sabrina would have been a good option but witches can't be trusted and for all I know it could be the hybrid who sent her.\n\"We are not going to become your ally, Sabrina. My father ruled the kingdom without witches and it was -\n\" It was a failed reign. Your mother died even when he knew magic could cure her. People were sacrificed for no reason because they were sorcerers, something he knew they were born with. Is that how you want to rule?  As a tyrant?\" she asked me.\nI clear my throat \"Well I would rather be feared than have anything to do with witches\" I reply to her.\nAn eerie smile creeps into her lip. \" You are as pathetic as your father \"she replied and stood up.\n\" You will regret this?\" she replied, glaring at me and Lorenzo and banging the door at us.",

I can feel something being dragged from my chest but my eyelid is too heavy to open for me to see who is removing whatever from my body.\nSomething twits in the middle of my heart causing me immense pain \"Argh!\" I shouted with agony.\nSlowly my eyes open even though it is blurry,  and someone is bending over me. Who could that be? Slowly my vision begins to clear, revealing the lady bending over me.\nDeep blue eyes, pale-looking skin, coral bead necklace. \"Sabrina,\" I mumble.\nFinally, my vision is clear. I glance around my room. The plane was painted black with an iron bar.\nWhere am I? I ask her as I sit up.\nThen like a tornado, my memories rush back accompanied by a painful headache. I and Lia's kiss, the kidnapped, Lia's rescue and me being stabbed.\n\"What are you doing here?\" I ask her. She betrayed me and decided to ally with my brother.\nShe sits beside me \"Is that the thank you I get for saving you?\" She asks.\nAnger rushed within me as I glared at her \"I should thank you for betraying me and taking my brother's side?\" I ask.\nShe chuckled \"I did not betray you, Luca\"\nA dark chuckle escaped me \"Of course, you did not Sabrina\" I replied with a smile. \"You showed your true cunning nature,\" I retorted.\nShe glared at me as her eyes darkened. I smiled, and I awakened her anger. \"Mind your tongue boy\" she warns. \"I wanted to teach you a lesson\"\nI run my tongue over my teeth. Well, you have taught me a good lesson. You have taught me to never trust you\" I reply.\nShe tilts her head to the side and then to me her face glints with anger.\"I did not leave you alone. I came to save you that is why you are here\"\nI chuckle of course she must think that I am a fool to believe she genuinely cared about me. \"Don't lie to me, Sabrina. You only came here because my brother refused you\" I replied with my voice deep.\nShe gives me a blank face \n\"Oh, and if you came to tell me to let go of Lia then I think you should just leave because I am not going to harm her\" I warn her as I state matter of factly.\nA smile tugged her lips \"Seems the mighty Luca had fallen for his brother's wife. You do know that is against our morals\" she replied with a mocking tune.\nI roll my eyes. Of all the excuses she could give is about morals``Well when you give me a law written by the moon goddess that says love should be selective I would consider it but for now no. Moreover, they are not mates''\nShe smacks her lip\"She has a mate, Luca, he will soon come for her\"\n\"And he will be damned if he would think I am going to let go of her easily without killing him\" I can't imagine living with someone else. I run my hand through my hair.\n\"He is an Alpha,\" she reminds me. An annoying fact that I know.\n\"I am a hybrid\" I remind her\nI sit up and face her, my face dark with seriousness\"What do you want Sabrina\" I ask her. \n\"To join our hands together,\" she replied with a smile.\nI give her a little laughter \" I am not doing anything to hurt Lia\"\n\"I know. I am restating our claim. Lia and Merlin would be protected\" she supplied.\nI lowered my eyebrow. She seems hell-bent on punishing Dean. I have no grudge against the witches. They helped me.\n\"Fine,\" I reply. A smile tugged her lips as she stood up, dusted her hands, and then squatted making sure she was on the same level with me. She pointed a finger at me.\n\"Don't be a fool, Luca. Do not let Lorenzo know that you are a hybrid, \"she warns.\nI kiss my teeth as I remember how I tore his skin. He must be looking for me or writing in pain\"Ahh, that can be dangerous but I don't care\" I reply nonchalantly.\n\"Well, I will help you wipe his memory away since you decided to be a fool. We will need to attack them with a big surprise and I will not let you destroy my plan\" she warned.\nA smile tugged my lips \"So he does not remember me?\" I ask. It would be such a pity trying to remember a hybrid especially after they had made sure they killed all my kind.\n\"No you dumb ass\" she reply then smile \"Though he was badly beaten. You were rough\" she reply with a mocking tone.\nI shrug.\"I was angry. They left Lia unconscious. I don't know what would have happened if I had not come\"\nA moment of silence passes \"What is next\" I ask because the twat has decided to spoil my plan by releasing Dean.\nShe grips my chin making me face her\"You must be careful. They are looking for the hybrid then we will just lie down for a while. When we get out you must lay low. Don't make trouble, don't anger him. You can fuck his wife for all you can but do not flop my plan\" she warns and let go of my chin. I rub my chin to remember to release the pain in my jaw.\nShe stands up and stretches her hands for me to take.\"I have heard, thank you\" I reply as I pull my shirt which is soaked with my blood.\nShe turned to me\"We are allies, Luca. We do favors not thank you\" she replied and escorted me outside the cell. I think I am invisible because the guards did not try to stop me.\nI make my way to my room after bidding her goodbye.",

I am quite sure he had a business with Sabrina because of the way he looked at her.\n\"Go to your room Lia,\" Sabrina said in a steel voice standing beside Luca. I furrowed my eyebrows. I thought she was on his side. I knew she was not meant to be trusted.\nI glared at her as I inwardly blamed myself for what happened. If I had told Luca that I wanted to go he would have followed me and Lorenzo would have not been able to trick me into his way.\nDean cleared his throat bringing me out of my thoughts \" You seem to be glaring at Sabrina. Do you have a problem with that?  Or is it because I stabbed your lover?\" he asked with a smirk on his face.\nI swallowed the anger in me and replaced it with a smile. \"No, I don't have a problem with it\" which was a very big lie. \"I was just wondering who would be a mate to a soulless man like you\" Immediately I said those words one of the men brought out his gun pointing it at me.\nDean's eyes darkened with anger \"You-\" he began but Sabrina cut him shut resting her hands on his own.\n\"Lia go to your room,\" she said with finality in her voice.\nI glared at the both of them and entered into my room. Immediately I entered,  I locked the door behind me with anger and began to unzip my clothes when I caught sight of something on my table.\nA rose flower with a letter. Who could have brought this for me? Had Luca been released? Then the familiar scent hit my nose. I turned around to meet Finn at the corner of my room staring intensively at me with a smirk on his face.\nI turned back to zip my clothes back \"How did you get in?\" I asked.\nHe chuckled a little bit \"Don't you think that is a very funny question?\" He asked as he walked towards me with his hands tucked into the pocket of his sweat pants, his white long-sleeve shirt hugged his body enhancing his abs. Is it just the mate bond or does this man happen to appear more attractive day by day?\nI turned around to look at him his eyes darkened but he was not staring at me. He was staring at my body, at the Mark and every other thing.\n\"What happened? Who did this to you?\" I bent my head naively. I was not even meant to be with him after what I promised Luca. I remained quiet, it seemed as if my quietness irritated the hell out of him.\nHe strolled towards me until it was just the air keeping us apart, he bent his face to my ear and whispered harshly \"Lia, for the sake of our relationship when I ask you a question, especially one that has to do with someone harming you. You answer me. You don't keep quiet\" he whispered as his hot breath fanned my ear lobe.\nI refused to talk, why would he pretend that he cared when all he did was come to my room to have fun while his beta killed my father-in-law?\n\"It's none of your business\" I answered quietly.\nHe took in a shaky breath, his ear reddened In anger \"You are my mate Lia and the future Luna to my pack. It is my business\"   he warned.\n\"There is no need to act like you care. Why are you here? Is your beta also here to kill Dean since all he does is kill people while you visit your mate's bed to comfort while you kill her Alpha\"\nA glint of anger passed through his eyes. He brushed his hair roughly. \"I spared your life lia. We were meant to kill his  Luna but I spared your life because you are my mate. Someone had to fill in for it\" he explained his eyes gradually softened.\nMy heart skipped a bit. Should I believe him? What If he was lying? He came closer his hands cupped my cheeks hot warmth passed through me. I leaned into my palm and closed my eyes.\n\"Who did this to you?\" He asked again softly. I opened my eyes to meet his blue one staring at me.\nMemories of what Dean did to me flashed before my eyes. The pepper rub, the whip, I even died for a minute. \n\"Dean\" I whispered.\nHis eyes darkened as he withdrew his palm from my face leaving a vacuum. He walked around the room as he cursed under his breath. He turned to look at me his voice filled with determination. \"We are leaving,\" he said and took my hand.\nI dragged my hands out of his own \"No\"\n\"What?\" He asked, his forehead folded.\n\"I said no. I told you to give me two weeks and you said okay\" I told him.\n\"Are you so interested in dying? A man like him can kill you next time. Have you taken a good look at yourself? You look weak, pale like a pack of bones and you want me to leave you here?  So that when next I come you will be dead? \" he asked me.\nHis words touched me a lot but I can't. Luca risked his life for me. How would he feel if he had found out that I left with my mate, he had made me promise him that I was going to stay with me. He needed me but this mate bond willed me to go with Finn, my mind still went back to him when I was alone.\n\"Just give me one week, please. I am about to live my life and follow you and I had a life before you came. I have friends and I have a guardian. I need to tell them goodbye\" he looked at me and nodded.\nHe walked towards me and pressed his lips to mine quickly and mumbled \"One week before you become mine\" he said and left.\nA knock immediately came to my door, and my heart dropped. Hope I did not do anything to them again.",

Wolves can smell an outsider and it would be hell if Dean found out that he was here.\nI  walked towards the door to open it. It was my maid she was carrying a box. \"Come in\" I replied.\nShe bowed her head and came inside. I stood behind her back and watched as she dropped the box on the bed.\n\"What is in there?\" I asked. She shook her head negatively. \"I don't know but I think it's clothes or a gift. They were sent by Lorenzo\" she said.\n\"Lorenzo? I thought Lorenzo was badly wounded?\" I asked.\n\"Yes, but he had recovered quickly. I think Sabrina healed him\" she said. \nI walked towards the box but Luca came in. The maid looked at me, and I waved at her to go. I immediately left the clothes and went to meet him.\nMy eyes turned water by seeing the scar on his chest. \"I am so sorry Luca\" I apologized.\nHe furrowed his bushy eyebrow \"Sorry for what?\" He asked.\nHow could he possibly forget what just happened so quickly? It was my fault that he was kidnapped or stabbed. Although he hurt my feelings when he rejected me I think he had a reason why.\n\"For putting you in this condition. For leaving without telling you and making you show Lorenzo who you truly are. Also for making Dean stab you. Is.. All.. My fault \"I said with a trembling voice.\nA smile tugged on his lips \"Come here\" he said opening his arms for me. I engulfed him in a tight hug. I closed my eyes as I felt his body warmth increase. I don't even know what I was doing but the thought of not seeing him again scared a whole lot of me even more than Finn my mate.\n\"I am fine Lia and besides I caused it. If I did not react that way you would have not left and don't worry about Lorenzo finding out about my identity. Sabrina whipped his memory\" he said and placed a soft kiss on my head.\nWhat did he mean by Sabrina wiped his memory? I looked at him, and he stared back at me smiling \"So you mean Lorenzo does not know about you?\" I asked.\n\"No. Okay, so we are safe. And besides you are safe and that is what matters\" he said and it warmed my heart.\nI immediately removed the box from my bed for him to sit. \"Do you feel any pain? Should I apply oil or something to ease the pain?\" I asked with a concern-filled voice.\nHe smiled \"As much as I enjoy you caring for me I am fine. Sabrina said she is on our side. She had to devise a way to make Lorenzo trust her,\"   he said.\nI nod absent-mindedly. I let go of my packed black hair, removed my necklace, and started zipping my clothes.\n\"What are you doing?\" He asked with a husky voice.\nA pink hue covered my cheek but I shrugged \"I don't know. I am changing my clothes\" I said.\nHe smiled \"in front of me?\"\n\"In front of you\"\nI pulled my skirt leaving only my underwear,    a my shirt leaving only my singlet which pierced my nipples. His eyes darkened as he watched me climb the bed.\nWhat was I doing? I don't even know but what I do know is that I wanted him. More than anything and I was going to have him today regardless of anything.\nI lay behind him for a while before I climbed on top of his chest. His arms encircled my waist, and desire rolled through us. We stared at each other for a while. I lifted my head and pressed my lips against his. He stood there for a while, his eyes wide open. \"What are you doing lia?\" He asked his voice filled with lust and desire.\n\"Kissing you\" I whispered. He swallowed hard as if he was trying to control himself. I began planting soft kisses from his mouth down to his nipple. I stopped at his nipple and licked it. He groaned loudly. \n\"Fuck this!\" he cursed at his breath. In a split second, he turned me over and started kissing me. Desire roed out of his mouth. I wrapped my arms around his neck, and a moan escaped me.\nWe kissed each other for a while, rolling desire with lust. He started planting soft kisses on my neck down to my nipples. His lips encircled my nipples. He sucked it for a while, while his hands played with the other one.\n\"Ahh!\" I moaned desire filled my voice. He worked his way to the other one repeating the same circle giving it a little bit and squeeze.\nHe worked his way down to my navel leaking my skin. His hands stopped at my underwear. He gently pulled the underwear away leaving me completely naked. He stared at my body for a while with his dark eyes filled with lust.\nI raised my body to meet him and started kissing him before he left me turned on just like he did the last time.\nHe laid me back carefully and worked his way in between my laps. He started planting soft kisses on each side of my lap. I moaned loudly waiting for him to walk his way to my honey pot. His tongue finally touched my  clit. He kept on licking it. Adrenaline rushed through me.\nI increased my moans as I grabbed the duvet. I closed my eyes in ecstasy as warmth rushed through me.\n\"Arrg!\" I shouted as he drove his middle finger into my hole and started thrusting. He increased his pace with mine. \n\"Luca.. I .. am  .about to come!\" I moaned out loud. I could feel myself reaching the spot.\nThen suddenly he removed his hands from my hole. My eyes widened. Why did he stop?\n?You don't get to come except I say so,\" he said and started pulling his clothes.",

He drew me closer to himself till our bodies touched each other. He began to kiss me hungrily. His tongue walked deeper into my mouth as his hands traveled down to my stomach.\nHis hands dug into my hole. I moaned in response. Just as the sex was becoming steamier my phone ran. His kisses stopped pissing me off. Who could that be\n\"Go and pick it,\" he said. I shook my head and deepened my tongue to his mouth. Gradually he reciprocated it, wrapping his arms around my waist.\nThe phone call came again and he cursed under his breath. I smiled, good he did not want to let go just like I did not want to.\n\"We.kiss. can. Kiss. ignore. it \"I mumbled against his lips. He shook his head and detached himself from me. \" It might be Lexie\" for Merlin,\" he said.\nIt touched me that he still thought about my son at this moment even though his father wanted to kill him. I moved to my dressing table where I had dropped the phone. I turned it on it was Lexie. \nI called her back in no time she picked the call up \"Lia.. Is..me. Please can you come to the house\" she asked her voice trembling with fear.\nMy heart sank immediately all the joy from sex washed away. Luca walked up to me and encircled his arms around me while planting soft kisses on my neck.\n\"what happened? Is he okay?\"I asked her. My heart sank at the thought of Merlin being sick, especially at this time when everything was still messed up. As sad as it may be I knew Merlin would never have a bond with his father. I would not even want him to be trained by him.\nThere was silence from the other side \"Lexie?\"\n\"Lorenzo is here, he has me at gunpoint\", she said and burst into tears.\n\"Lorenzo?\" I asked and Luca stopped right on track. He turned me around to face him his eyebrow furrowed. \"What?\" He mounted.\n\"Lexie I am-\" the line went off.\nFear gripped me I stared at the phone. My feet grew cold. \"Is everything all right?\" Luca asked sensing my worry.\n\"Lorenzo is with Lexie\" I, said my voice trembling with fear. Luca's eyes widened, of course, he knew that we would be in a really bad situation if Lorenzo was with Lexie.\n\"What the fuck is wrong with this man?\" he shouted angrily the veins on his head throbbing threatening to pop out of anger.\n\"What did he say he wanted?\"  he asked me.\nI shook my head with tears-filled eyes \"He did not say what he wanted. But I am sure he wants me. What if he kills me, what if he hkikillse-\"\nMy thoughts immediately went to Merlin. Oh no,  if he saw Merlin he would immediately know that he was Dean's child. They looked alike a lot. He would take him away from me. That was something I could not bear. Merlin was my life, my joy my everything.\nMy throat clustered together, and the air became too heavy as I struggled to breathe. My heartbeat increased while my skin grew pale. \n\"Hey, hey. Breath\" Luca said softly encircling me in a hug as he rubbed my exposed skin. \nLittle by little everything came back to normal. My breathing stabilized.\n\"We are going to get dressed and go there.\"\nMy body still shook in fear \"What..what if he has Merlin? \" I raised my head to stare at him. \"What if he wants to kill him,\"  she asked.\nHe took a deep breath and heaved a sigh \"He might not be there. He might be at Benedicta\" he said trying to sound as calm and collected as he could\nI nodded and began to dress up, he wore his clothes and left my room also to get dressed. He came back a few minutes later and we made our way towards the gate, both of us uncertain of what was going to happen.\nThe drive to Lexie's house was silent. Immediately he stopped the car engine he gave me a wooden knife to stab Lorenzo if he came towards me.\n\"If it comes to worse turn into your wolf form and run away with your child,\" he said his voice deep with anger.\n\"What about you?\" I asked. I would not want him to get hurt because of me.\nHe looked at me or rather he stared at my soul \"I am a hybrid, I will be fine\"  he said with an assuring smile.\nI nodded grateful that I had him with me all the time. We got out of his car and heaved a sigh. \nHe squeezed my hand gently with a smile.  we walked towards the door and opened it. \nMy jaw dropped immediately after I opened the door. Lorenzo sat on his couch facing the door with Lexie sitting on the ground. His knife pressed against Lexie's pale skin.\nMy eyes immediately search around for Merlin. Thankfully he was not there.",

Luca's eyes were reduced to a split.\n\"What are you talking about?\" He asked.\nLorenzo stood up from the couch. And strolled towards us with a plastered smile, his blonde hair scattered and his neck still had marks of Luca's bite in it. I am not even sure he has taken his bath because he still had his blood-stained clothes on.\n\"You know I have been following you all around and I discovered that your mistress here always visits this place so often. I am pretty sure I kidnapped her but don't remember what happened next. Then it occurred to me, \"Is either your mistress cheating on you with someone who is a hybrid or Lexie is the hybrid\" he explained.\nLuca and I stood there watching him. Without showing any emotions. At least Merlin was out of the question. We could fight on our own without worrying about him and I know for certain that Luca would tame Lorenzo when the time comes.\nLuca cleared his throat \"You kidnapped her?\" He asked feigning ignorance.\nLorenzo cracked a smile \"Oh yes but her savior came to release her\" he said.\nWhat did he mean? Did he mean that he knew that Luca was a hybrid?\n\"So you think I am a hybrid, but you just called me a rogue?\" Luca said.\n\"Of course not, I know you are a valueless rogue known only for his tyranny.\" he said and turned to her \"But I do know that she is the hybrid,\"  he said pointing at Lexie.\nLuca burst into laughter, he laughed and laughed and kept quiet and continued laughing \"Seriously, you think Lexie is the hybrid. Did you smell any hybrid in her? You think if she was a hybrid you would not be dead by now?\"  he asked, still laughing.\nLorenzo swallowed hard, and Lexie stared at me with pitiful tear-filled eyes. Her mouth was covered with a bind \"Release her and ask her to attack me\" Luca said.\nI glared at Luca, he knew that Lexie was not a hybrid then what was he trying to do? Lorenzo looked at him and foolishly went to Lia asking.\n\"Stand up and change to your wolf form. I want to see you.\" He ordered.\nLexie quickly changed to her wolf form and back. Lorenzo curled his hands into a fiat as his eyes reddened. He narrowed his eyes at me and Luca and turned away, of course, he will never suspect us.\n\"So?\" Luca asked \"I can't see a hybrid anywhere?  \"he said looking around.\nLorenzo narrowed his gaze to me and advanced me, fear gripped me at the thought of whatever he was going to do. I brought out the wooden stake Luca had given me but Luca stepped in front of me. \n\"Don't you dare\" he growled.\nLorenzo scoffed \"What do you think people are going to say about you? You will be a symbol of pity. Look at the rogue who decided to fuck his lose brother's wife to comfort himself for his mate that was killed\", he said.\nLuca's shoulders tightened. He never liked people talking about his mate around him. I am sure he missed her from time to time because they shared a bond unlike me who never had a bond with my mate except Finn who seems protective but sometimes it crosses my mind that he might just be pretending to care.\n\"Call her loose again and I will make you lose your head\" Luca growled.\n\"How? Do you want to kill a beta? Your cousin would sentence you for that?\" He said.\nLuca tilted his head and scoffed \"You seem to be so proud about this beta position.\"\n\"Of course, I am,\" Lorenzo answered with a hint of pride.\n\"Has it ever occurred to you that a weak-minded Alpha with an ignorant beta would be the worst combination\"\n\"I mean it's pathetic because you were bitten by a hybrid and you come to threaten the life of a wolf thinking she is a hybrid. I mean, is that the best you can do?\"\n\"I would find that hybrid, and I will bring him to hurt you,\" he said pointing at Luca.\nA smile crept into my lips. He is never going to find the hybrid because the hybrid is the one standing before him.\n\"Why don't you ask the person that healed you of your bite? I am sure she will know\" Luca suggested with a smile.\nLorenzo took a step backward and started pacing around the room. \"You don't get it Luca, we will be in trouble if the hybrid decides to attack, the park would be in trouble. We don't even know how many of them are still existing,  \"he ponders.\nLuca nodded his head as if he was thinking with him. \"What are you trying to say?\" He asked Lorenzo.\nLorenzo walked up to him and squeezed his shoulder, he raised his gaze to meet Luca's own.\n\"I am saying that we join hands together and bring that hybrid down. We were once brothers, you know, and I still see you as one even though Dean is blinded by revenge. You don't know who the hybrid would attack next it might be Lia or Lexie or even you\" he implored.\nLuca scoffed with a smile. \"I thought I was a rogue. Useless, right? Is that not what you Guys called me.?\"  he asked Lorenzo and pulled him by his collar \"We were never friends and we will never be and if you think Dean is the one thirsty for power then you thought wrong. Because I am throne thirsty for vengeance and I will -\nThe door cracked open. I turned to see who it was, and my heart dropped at once. It was Merlin. He stood there looking at us, his hair wet with water. He smiled \"Mummy!\"",

He will ask me who the father of the child was and why he was calling me mother and for all is worth I can't deny my son.\nDifferent thoughts raised through my mind \"What if he is caught? What If they mistook him for Luca's child? What will Dean do if he finds out? He might take Merlin from me.\nLorenzo advanced his quality and squatted before him. Of course, he must have seen the resemblance between him and his best friend.\n\"Hello boy? \"he said. I knew he was trying to get some truth out of him.\n\"Hi,\" Merlin answered.\n\"What is your name?\" He asked.\nMerlin looked at Lexie who shook her head at him. Merli kept quiet. Lorenzo turned around to glare at us.\n\"Who is your mother?\"Lorenzo asked him in a calm collected cunning voice. Merlin looked at him and raised his head to look at us, Lexie was standing beside me. He raised his hands as I closed my eyes waiting for him to point at me then I would be done for and all my secrets would be exposed. Then in a split second, the door opened and someone carried him away. No,    t someone Benedicta carried him away. I knew it from her scent.\nI heaved a sigh of relief as tears of joy slipped through my eyes. I quickly wiped it away before Lorenzo could see it. \nLorenzo turned to look at me and Lexie. He glared at both of us. \"Who owns that child?\" He asked. I swallowed hard, lexie grabbed my palms and rubbed the top with her thumb.\n\"We don't know the child\" she replied, her face laced with boldness. Luca and I turned to her, surprised at her claim. What if they discovered she was lying? She is not even meant to be talking.\n\"Liar! How can a child walk in and call one of you his mother? How would I believe that? One of you is his mother!\" he shouted, making the both of us flinch.  fear crept up within me.\n\"Well Lia is my best friend and she has never slept with someone. I on the other hand have no child. How am I not sure that the child belongs to you? You seem so concerned about a child that is not ours\" she asked him.\nLorenzo's nostrils flared as he glared at her, he rushed towards her slamming her back against the nearest wall his hands wrapped around her neck\"That child is a carbon copy of the Alpha's family\" he said.\n\"Then..it..could be Luca's Child?\" She said breathing.\nI lowered my eyebrows. What game was she trying to play? It seemed as if whatever game she was playing worked because Lorenzo let go of her and faced Luca. She fell on the floor gasping for breath. I rushed towards her to raise her.\n\"Is he your child?\" He asked Luca.\nLuca stared at me and shook his head \"Unlike you and Dean I don't fuck around and impregnate people. I am sure the child is for someone around the neighborhood so ask them. Maybe they will let you know that Dean had a child. Then you can let him know that he has an heir\" he said.\n\"A bastard can't be an heir\"\nLuca scoffed \"Right now, Dean has rejected his mate. I doubt if there is any other person who will be his mate so he better take the child as his son or I will take the throne\"  he warned.\nLorenzo turned to look at us \" I will tell the Alpha about what I just saw  \"he said.\nWhat he just saw. What did he mean by what he just saw? \"About the magic that happened just now and he will have you both punished for it\" he warned and added \"The only way you would be free is if you tell me who owns the child\" he shouted.\nNo one talked, we just stared at us. Seeing that we were never going to talk to him he said \"I will come for you all\" he said pointing at both of us apart from Luca.\nHe took his knife and left. Luca stood at the door watching him go with no one by his side. Immediately Luca confirmed that he had gone, he locked the door and heaved a sigh of relief. He turned to us.\n\"Merlin is no longer safe here. I will go and tell Benedicta about the attack while you deal with Lexie\" he said and turned to Lexie \"Thank you\" he said. Lexie nodded in approval.\nMy heart warmed with the thought of Luca thanking Lexie for Merlin's sake. Something only a father would do. Gosh! now I wish I had slept with Luca and not Dean\n\"Why don't you go tomorrow? I will go with you. Lorenzo might come back to attack us\" I said with a low voice.\nLuca's eyes softened as he stared at me. \"Don't worry about Lorenzo. He is cunning but not a coward; he only attacks when it is needed and if it is not he will stay away\" he explained with a smooth assuring voice and a comforting smile.\nHe walked up to me and pecked me on my forehead. \"I am going to be back in no time,\" he said and walked away locking the door behind me.\nI watched as he drove away before turning to Lexie who had a questioning look on her forehead.\n\"Don't tell me you have fallen in love with him?\" she asked with a raised eyebrow.\nI heaved a deep sigh \"We need to talk\"",

I knew so many questions were running in Lexie's mind. The last time we talked I told her how much I hated Luca.\n\"Can I explain?\"I asked softly, trying to pacify her anger.\nShe took a deep breath and glared at me \"Fine but just to make it make sense she said and sat on the sofa\" her face laced with a frown.\nI sat down beside her \"I think I like him?\" I said with a bent head.\n\"What?\" She asked with surprise. I nodded my head. \"Oh, good lord!\" She groaned as she rubbed her forehead. \"Lia you can't be with him, he might be using you for all I know and he is bad '' she said.\nI shook my head disagreeing with her \"I don't think so and what makes you think he is bad\"\n\"Because... Because'' she raised her eyebrow. \"Because it is Luca. He is like the symbol of evil for our pack. A man that made us lose our Luna is not even meant to be with you who is Dean Luna '' she explained.\nI nodded. I knew she would be worried about me. That has been the reason I had kept it from her but with what we did before we came here, how he let go of control while kissing me. I knew that I was going to have him and keep him with me for as long as I could.\n\"Whatever enmity he had with Dean ended when he killed his mother. It has nothing to do with me, besides he has saved me multiple times and has stood up for me, is that not how love works?\" I asked her. I mean that was what we both shared as our idea of love. Someone who loved us and put us before himself and Luca had proven himself countless times without number.\n\"No! That is how manipulation works\" she exclaimed \"He would prove himself worthy make you trust him then go away like he always does\" she shouted.\nI pressed my eyelids together for a while. She should just try to trust him. I mean he will never hurt me.\n\"How long?\" She asked me to draw my thoughts.\n\"What?\" I asked with a raised eyebrow.\n\"How long has this been going on?\" she asked me again, her voice deep with anger.\n\"I don't know... I mean. I think since I got married not like we just jumped into bed but he became my friend and then we started seeing each other. Okay. I don't think I can call it an affair, um, we haven't had sex just kissing and smooching\" I explained.\n\"That's a long time lia. I don't want anything bad to happen to you\" she said.\n\"How is our Alpha taking it? I mean surely he must have noticed you guys' closeness. Is he okay with sharing with you?\" She asked\nI nodded \"Yeah, he does not care about me only about himself and you know we are not mates\"\n\"Even though he seems like a nice man he must have cared about you,\" she said. \nI shook my head. It seemed as if the pack did not know the type of wolf they had as an Alpha. I stood up and zipped down my dress to show the marks I sustained from him.\nShe gasped at the mark, and she ran her hand over my back. \"Who did this to you?\" She asked in a soft voice.\nI turned towards her \"Your Alpha\" I said.\n\"Oh my gosh, this can't be true and why would he do such a thing?\" she asked.\n\"Because he found out about my mate and it was my mate's friend that killed his father,\" he said.\nShe widened her eyes with shock as she covered her mouth. She stared at me, \"Who is your mate?\" She asked.\nI swallowed hard ready to spill the truth \"It is Finn, Finn from the bloodlust pack. The one that killed Dean's father\" I explained.\n\"Seriously? What sought of fate do you have? Why would the moon goddess put you in such a tight condition?\" she asked with concern, laced in her voice.\nI shrugged as turned my back to zip my clothes \"Maybe the moon goddess wants me to end Dean's life\"\n\"What? End the Alpha's life? Don't let someone hear about this, not even your so-called Luca\" she warned.\nI nodded and turned to her \"While Dean was tormenting me I passed out, I think I died and the moon goddess gave me the right to end Dean's life. If I don't do so our kind will suffer \"I told her.\nA smile curved on her lips and she burst into laughter \"Were you hallucinating? I mean how would you see the moon goddess and be alive, you only see her when you die!\" she shouted, hitting my head.\nI glared at her with a serious face \"Wait, you weren't joking?'' she asked. I shook my head in return.\nHer eyes widened with disbelief \"Wait you mean all this while when I have been here, you died and came back?\" she asked.\n\"See it like a second chance\" I replied to her and sat down. I wish I would just have one day where I would not do anything and I would not have to worry about Merlin or Dean or Luca or Finn.\n\"And what did your mate say?\" she asked.\n\"He wants to take me next week, I have not made up my decision although Luca had made it clear that he would rather die than have my mate take me away from him he does not know of the one-week ultimatum though\" I added.\nShe nodded \"I feel you should tell him. It would be a good thing and just follow your heart, okay?\"\nI nodded \"Okay\"\nLuca horned from outside indicating that he was back. \"I have to go,\" I said.\n\"Come back before you go. It had been a long time since we spent time together and I kind of miss my friend, '' she said with a low voice.\nMy smile widened \"Aww, don't worry I will come back\" I said and hugged her before leaving.\nAs I stepped out of the house I made up my mind to tell Luca about Finn.",

Immediately I closed the car and his intoxicating smell hit my nostrils.\n\"How is he?\" I asked buckling my seat belt.\n\"He's okay\" he said \"Same old\" he added. I could feel his eyes on me.\nImmediately he was sure that I had toked in my seat belt and he started driving. Uncomfortable silence filled the air, his shoulders tightened and his lips formed into a tight line which was unusual for Luca considering the fact that he was always carefree when he was driving.\nCome to think about it, he was driving slowly instead of the usual Luca who drove about the normal speed limit.\nI placed my hands on top of his hands that were on the gear \"Are you okay?\" I asked.\nHe nodded his eyes still focused on the road \"Why?\" He asked.\nI shrugged \"you seem quiet. Is everything alright?\"\nHe tilted his head to my side and back to the road.\n\"I am fine. It just..is just that Merlin called me Dad today\" he explained.\nI sat up right trying to process whatever he just said \"what?\" I asked.\nHe nodded \"Surprising right\"he said as he made a u-turn on the road.\nI cleared my throat \"What did you say?\" I asked with a low voice. Please don't tell me he broke his heart.\n\"I played along. He said Benedicta said I was his dad, and you were with me. Said you should visit more often so that he misses you\" he said.\nI knew my boy missed me and I missed him too, much more than I can explain. But spending time with him was a big risk I was not about to take, not after what just happened.\n\"Well just for further preference when you visit him let him know that I am not his dad\"he said with a sharp voice.\nI furrow my eyes. Why did he respond with such a tone? Was he angry? Did I do something to anger him? And why was he so bent on making me point it out to Merlin that he was not his dad?.\n\"Okay, but I think he will know that as time goes on\" I said.\n\"No need for him to discover it. Just let him know that I am not his dad. I don't want him mixing me up with Dean. I don't want any of Dean's property\" he retorted harshly.\nPain bottled in my chest. Was I a fool for trusting him and why was he being a two tongued person? He acts like he likes me,kisses me and he even almost had sex with me and just some minutes ago he was playing all Mr hero.\n\"He's my child Luca\" I said, trying to pacify whatever anger was breeding within me.\nHe looked at me ,this time with a glare \"Doesn't matter\" he shrugged and focused on the road back.\n\"Have I done something?\"\n\"Like what lia?\" He asked even though he replied with a sharp glare he still called my name a little softer.\n\"I don't know. Anything that would make you treat me this way!\"I shouted, my voice trembling with pain.\n\"I haven't touched you or treated you badly, I was just staring at you,\" he replied nonchalantly, cutting my heart deeply.\n\"Yes but you know you don't have to touch me to hurt me. Your words are doing just fine. You have saved my son, risked your life for me and even almost had your true identity exposed and almost had sex with me, in fact you touched me!\" I shouted as tears filled my eyes why the hell was he doing this.\n\"I would have risked my life for my maid as long as I get her on my bed whenever I want. And plus maybe you grew up in a toxic environment. Gentlemen are normally nice to people, especially girls. Put that at the back of your mind the next time you mistake kindness for lust or love\"he said nonchalantly. \nTick silence filled the car as I watched him break my heart. He has given me reason countless times to not trust him. I was right,lexie was true, he was bad and selfish. \n\"So you were just playing with my feelings all this while?\" I asked.\nHe chuckled and licked his pink lips \"Surprised right? You are surprised that you are not the only one who know how to play with people fucking emotions?\" He shouted at me, his eyes darkened with anger.\n\"What do you mean? Are you trying to call me a player or trying to accuse me of being manipulative because you are the definition of a manipulative person. You act like you care while you don't!''I screamed on top of my voice.\n\"So you do not think you are not being manipulative?''he asked with an eerie quiet tone.\n\"Yes!\" I screamed I was really done with him and his two faced personality.\n\"How about Finn? You never told me he was going or that he usually visits your room. Have you ever stopped for once to think of how I will feel when I discover that you  still reassured Finn that you were going to leave with him then a few minutes later you kiss me!\" He shouted at me with a shaky voice. His vein throbbed from his forehead.\nHow did he find out? How did he know about Finn's secret visit?\n\"I was about to tell you\" I implored in a pleading voice.\nHe quickly diverted the car to the side of the road, almost hitting the wall beside us. \"When ? When were you going to tell me? When you were leaving with him for a day?\"he asked.\n\"Just now. I promise you I told Lexie about it that I was going to tell you\" I begged. His tone was scaring me a whole lot.\nHe glared at me then unblocked his seat belt and turned around to open my door. I watched him with wide eyes.\n\"Get out,\" he ordered.\n\"What?\" I asked. He can't be doing this.\n\"I said get.out!\" I remained in the car. He couldn't drop me on the road  in the middle of nowhere.\nHe grabbed my hands and pulled me out. He looked at me, his eyes softened for a while before it darkened again. He pulled out his wallet and dropped some money into it.\n\"It is either me or him when you are done picking, inform me till then goodbye. I am not a toy you play with because you need some masculine support or a masculine presence for you and your son!\"he shouted and closed the door and drove off.

I have asked my bodyguards to make sure I am not disturbed. Who could that be?\n\"Dean!\" Lorenzo shouted, his voice echoing around the floor. \"Tell your mother fucking guards to let me in\" he shouted banging the door.\nI stood up and walked towards the door and opened it. \"Let him in,\" I ordered.\nThe guards stood aside for him to come in. \nHe entered inside and locked the door.\nI furrowed my eyebrows and watched him turn to me. \"We need to talk,\" he said, his voice filled with urgency.\nAs I walked towards my chair I said \"Seriously, can't I have peace for once? Whatever you have to say, tell my guards Lorenzo. I have duties as an Alpha, not your best friend as an Alpha and I haven't touched any record because of what has been happening. Now that Luca is out can you hold out on every other emergency? They can wait\"  I sighed deeply as I sat down leaning my back against the chair.\nHe scoffed \"Except you do not want to remain the Alpha you would listen to me. You do know that Luca is not the only opposition you have, right? \"He asked with a raised eyebrow.\nI narrowed my eyes \" What are you talking about?\". To me,  the only enemy I had was Luca or at least he is the inky one that is a bad opposition. He wants my crown and he wants my whore of a Luna.\nHe stood up and went to the bar where my expensive collection of wines was arranged and poured tequila into a glass. He turned to me grimly as he watched the surprise on my face.\n\"Lorenzo\" I warned sternly, he had better have something meaningful to say.\nHis grin widened, he took the wine in a gulp and I watched as his Adam's apple moved as the wine passed his throat. He squeezed his eyes slightly suppressing the harsh taste of the wine.\nHe poured another one and walked up to me \"Well, for starters. Luca is awake\" he announced.\nMy jaw dropped as I watched his face to see if he was lying or not \"How do you know\"\nHe dropped the half-filled glass on my seat and sat upright. \"Well, I have been tracing Lia's movement. She seemed to be visiting a particular place so often so I went there to propose a truce\"\n\"A truce?\" I asked. \"How can you propose a truce with Lia's friend? Why will you want it from her?\"I asked. He remained silent, staring at me. I hated Lorenzo at times like this, especially when he had decided to drop the tip of information and let me figure it out myself.\nMy eyes narrowed. \"Don't tell me you went to ask her for sex?\"\nHe groaned and rolled his eyes. He rubbed his forehead. I could see annoyance building up within me \" I have a mate!\" he shouted, hitting his hands on my table. His eyes were red with anger.\nI flinched at his outburst. Of course,  I knew he would never cheat on his mate. He was too smitten to cheat on her but then again who visits the best friend of his best friend's wife?\nI shrugged \"Well, what did you want me to say? You have never visited a lady's house except for business. So it was surprising that you visited her to form a truce\" I explained.\nHis glare reduced as his eyebrow turned to normal. He took in a deep breath \"It was not for her. I used her to draw Lia out of this place because according to you, Luca was gone. I thought it would be a perfect time to ask her if she could join hands with me\"\nI shook my head. Seriously, whatever he was saying did not make any sense. Why would he ask her to help him when he knew that she was neither a hybrid nor a witch?\n\"Why her?\" I asked \"And how does this lead to Luca being awake because for all I know.\n\"Well maybe you have not noticed but Sabrina has a soft spot for Lia. She had always protected her\" he explained.\n\"Sabrina? The last time I checked Sabrina was on my side. She even forced Lia to go to her room\" I have explained countering whatever he has just said. \n\"Why did you put Luca in the cell and allow Lia to go?\" He asked quietly.\n\"Well because she is a woman and beside Sabrina-\nThen I remembered how Sabrina had vehemently advised me against putting her in the cell according to her she was a woman\nFuck! I have been fooled.\n\"On arrival, she came with Luca,  \"he said.\nMy heart sank into my stomach. How did Luca get out? I groaned in anger. It only meant two things: either I had removed it while I was drunk, which was something I knew would never happen or Sabrina had helped her just as she helped me.\nI looked at Lorenzo who had a mischievous smile on his face. He was getting satisfaction from watching me put things together.\n\"Well, when I got there I saw\nHe explained everything from beginning to end. Including the strange child and the disappearance.\n\"We need to add fast. I think the witches, particularly Sabrina, are on their side\" he warned.\nI sat up, \"What do you want me to do?\" I asked.\n\"Change\"\nI furrowed my eyebrows \"Change?\"\nHe nodded \"Win lia over, is the only way out. Without Lia Luca will not be that motivated to go against you\"",

My thoughts wandered back to what would have happened if Benedicta had not come in to save Merlin.\nI close my eyes to part for Lexie's safety. She is a very sweet girl and does not deserve any of the stress I have put her through as a friend. Gosh! I need to get her out of Lorenzo's mind. He might come back for her later when I am not around. \nJust when I was about to sleep a knock came. Knock! Knock! Knock!\nI groaned as I raised my tired body to open the door.

How would she say she did not know about the event? The maids were the first to get wind of any gossip.\nI walked towards her calmly trying to detect if she was lying through her face.\n\"The Alpha asked the cooks to cook for a feast but we do not know what it's for.

That's all I know ma\"  she said.\nI took a good look at her, from her toes which were decorated with scandals to her hair which was packed in a bun. She bent her head down shyly. \n\"You can go,\" I ordered.\nShe nodded and hastily left. I walked towards my bed. I picked up the purple velvet gown that he bought for me. It had red embroidery around the edges. It came with a gold crown and a black shoe.\nMaybe if I asked Luca he would have an answer even though I knew that the probability of knowing was little.\nOr maybe I  just wanted to talk to him. To see if he was still angry.\nI knocked on his door twice before he opened. Immediately he saw that I was the one his face changed into a frown and my heart dropped immediately.\n\"What?\" He asked so loudly that I grew cold feet. Was he this angry? He surely cannot blame me at all times when whenever I started getting close to him he would drop my hopes immediately.\n\"I came to see you, ''I replied quietly. He glared at me for a while before letting me in. I gasped at the sight of his room. Clothes were scattered everywhere, drawers flung open and luggage on top of his bed.\n\"Are you packing?\" I asked. My voice sounded almost like a whisper. Was he leaving me? Just like that? That means if I had not come to his room he would have gone without a word.\n\"What does it look like I am doing?\" He asked as he folded more of his clothes.\n\"And you did not bother telling me?\nHe rolled his eyes, one of his hands rested on his waist while the other rubbed his head. Irritation filled his face.\n\"Why should I tell you? Are you my wife or my lover?\" He asked, shattering my heart once more.\nI would have stayed in my room and just wallowed in self-pity till sleep took over me\n Instead, I came here expecting him to do what? Beg me? Because he gave me some heads and kissed me a few times or told me he loved me even though I was his cousin's wife. Someone he despised so much.\nTears filled my eyes. I took in a deep shaky breath as I tried to stop the tears from falling.\nHe looked at me and his eyes softened for a while before they retook the dark eyes \"If you came here to cry please. leave \" he ordered with a cold voice.\nI gathered whatever dignity I had left and walked towards the door. Just as I was about to open the door he called.\n\"Lia,\" he called softly. I paused for a while, and my heartbeat quickened. I could feel his eyes boring into the back of my neck as he made his way towards me.\nGoosebumps filled my skin as warmth crept within me. What was he going to do? What was he going to say?\n\"Turn around\" \nI was meant to be angry and stand my ground. You can't just treat me like trash and expect me to fall at his feet whenever he needs someone to warm his bed. But I foolishly turned around.\nHe leaned towards me and pressed my body against it till there was no space left.\nHe stared at me with warm blue eyes, and my heartbeat fastened. His masculine Cologne filled the air.\n\"I will be gone for a few days. Just make sure you are safe\" he said quietly and pecked me on my cheeks.\nHe stared at me for a while before he stepped backward. \n\"You have this whole time to make up your mind,\" he said in a more pleading voice.\nI nodded. I opened my mouth to say something. Say I would willing to choose him over everything but I closed it and left",

How his voice sounded so weak because even if I knew he did not say please he was indirectly pleading with me to not leave him.\nI tossed around my bed as our few cherished memories replayed in my head. Unlike Finn who just came in here to remind me of who he was. Finn was my mate for sure and I was bound to feel emotionally or sexually drawn to but all I could find myself thinking about was how he would have treated me if I was his mate.\nHe would have probably killed me, unlike Luca who would do everything within his grasp to make sure I was happy. Finn simply viewed our bond as a business deal. He cannot lose because of me that is why he killed my Alpha in my place.\nI wanted Luca, I wanted him so badly. I wanted him inside me, wanted to feel the heat of his mouth against my nipples. Memories of our last encounter flooded my mind and sent strange warmth to the bottom of my belly and between my toes.\nA knock on my door disrupted me from my thoughts. I groaned in frustration. Who could that be and what did he want from me now?\n\"Come in!\" I shouted, too tired to stand up and open the door. \nOf course, it would be the maid  I would ask her to wash some of my clothes but then the door opened revealing a sweaty shirtless Dean.\nWhat the hell was he doing here? And why was he here like this dressed in grey sweatpants? What was he trying to do? seduce me? Eww, bile welled up in my tummy at the thought of it.\n\"Like what you see?\" He asked with raised eyebrows.\nI rolled my eyes \"You need to get rid of that pickup line. It is getting old. Don't you think? \"I asked sharply. Making him know that I was not impressed by whatever he was trying to do.\nHe smiled a little bit, \" That does not answer my question,\" he replied lazily.\nI sat upright. \"Well, if it was Luca it would have been a dream come true but it is you so no need\" I replied.\nA glint of anger passed through his eyes and I smiled satisfied at what I just did. He needed to know that there was no place for him within me.\nHe cleared his throat \" That's my cousin we are talking about \"he replied casually trying to hide his anger which was evident in his tightened muscles.\nI shrugged \" Well I am a whore\" I replied using his words against him \"What would you expect?\" I asked.\nHe swallowed hard, and a moment of silence passed through us. Each second my irritation grew larger. \"What do you want, husband?\" I asked with a smile, a smile that was evident enough for everyone to know it was fake.\nA smile tugged on his lips \"At least you remember that I am your husband. May I sit?\" He asked\nI nodded and tapped my side for him to sit.\n\"We will be having a party this evening,\" he said.\nI nodded \"Well, I have already figured that out\" I replied trying to sound happy and not over bored.\n\"Good. I want you to put in your best outfit and come to the party without any grudges toward me\" he said lowly\nI nodded, unsure of what he meant by \"Without any grudge toward me\". Oh, mean why would he think I would not have a grudge against him after what he did?\n\" Okay, I will try to act like a good couple. Although you should not blame me if my facial expression acts otherwise\" I replied.\nA smile tugged at the side of his lips \"Good. I sent you some clothes. I am sure you have gotten them,\" he said and stood up to leave.\n\"Wait. I am not comfortable with the clothes. I want to put on something that will show my shape and beauty\" I said, turning around for him to see me.\n\"Something that will show my back a little and will show the marks on my body, \"I said teasingly.\nHis eyes darkened with strange emotions. Maybe it was annoyance or guilt. Although I was very certain that someone like that would feel guilt.\n\"Please,\" he added.\nMy jaw dropped as my eyes widened. Did he just say please? Then the realization hit me suddenly. He was up to something. Something that I would not know until the party.\nI decided to play along by nodding slightly \"Okay\" I said.\nHis eyes brightened, he nodded with a smile and left. Immediately he closed the door behind him. I let out a sigh and moved quickly to lock the door in case he came to show his confusing face again in front.\nI rushed back to the clothes he had sent my maid to deliver to me. I searched thoroughly for a trace. Something that would tell me he had evil intentions against me. Like maybe he poisoned the cloth because this man wanted me dead just a week ago. Surely he can't just fall in love with me and want me to put everything aside.\nHe surely had a motive but what could that motive be? I asked myself.\nThe sound of my phone interrupted my thoughts. I rushed towards it. It was an unknown number. Who could this be? I asked myself as I picked up the call.\n\"Hello, gorgeous,\" the caller said.\nI furrowed my eyebrows. Was this a trick or something? Who sits down and calls someone gorgeous?\n\"Who is this?\"\n\"Ouch, thought you would recognize your mate,\" the caller said.\nMy heart dropped for a minute \"Finn?\" I asked.\n\"Yes, love. I heard they would be having a party at your palace today. Just wanted to ask if you would spare me just a few minutes to dance with you?\" He asked.\n\"Don't be ridiculous, Finn. I don't have time for that. What do you want?\"I asked.\n\"Nothing. Just a dance with you\" he replied with a teasing tone and hung up before I could reply.\nI groaned, can a day be more hectic?",

        "content": "Lia pov.\nHours passed by and the most anticipated moment came. I finished taking my bath and watched as two maids dressed me. Dean had sent two other people to dress me up. Which was strange. Maybe he was expecting a very important person or maybe the moon goddess was paying a visit. Whatever he had in mind remained a mystery to me.\nI watched as they did my makeup carefully and wore my accessories. Ava, one of the maids, took out the necklace from the jewelry box and wore it on my neck.\nIt felt heavy, too heavy to wear with an already suspicious husband. If need be I needed to be as light as I could in case he decided to kill me.\n\"Remove it. It's too heavy\" I complained, trying to remove it on my own.\n\"Sorry, but you can't. Alpha Dean had made us promise that you would wear everything he sent to you\" she replied.\nA hiss escaped my mouth. What the hell was he trying to do?\nI turned to her \"Well as your Luna I am telling you to remove it\" I said with a stern voice. \nThe room fell silent with my outburst. Ava flinched at my outburst.\n\"But- she began.\n\" Don't make me repeat myself,\" I replied. She removed it quickly and put it back into the box.\n\"You can go,\" I ordered.\nShe stared at me with surprise and I returned with a glare. She bowed her head and left.\nThe rest finished their work in complete utter silence making sure they followed my instructions.\nThe door opened revealing a well-dressed Dean. Everyone bowed their heads except me. \n\"Are you done with the makeup?\" he asked my servant. She nodded and he dismissed them leaving only me and him in the room.\n\"What do you want?\" I asked Dean while putting on my shoe since he had decided to dismiss all my maids.\n\"I heard you refused to put on the jewelry I sent to you. So I brought you a much lighter customized diamond according to your taste\" he said and placed it on the front of my dressing table.\nI opened the box. A gasp escaped my mouth at the sight of the jewelry. It looked so beautiful with my name spelled on it.\n\"Do you like it?\" he asked.\nDid I like it? Yes. Was I going to tell him that I loved it? No. Why? Because it would mean that I had decided to accept whatever truce he was offering.\n\"Well, it is impressive but it doesn't mean I like it. Though I would love to keep it\" I replied.\nA smile crept to his lips \"Good\" he said and added. \"Now that you are done with your dressing. Can we go?\" He asked.\nI furrowed my eyebrows. Since when did we start arriving at parties together? What would Finn think if he saw me and him like this? Looking all happy. Would he get jealous? No, he would not. He knew that he could be killed. My mind went back to Luca. I was pretty sure that if he was here he would do something to make everyone know that I belonged to him. A smile crept on my lips at the thought of his possessiveness.\n\"May I know what is occupying the mind of my beloved wife?\"Dean asked.\nI stood up and walked towards the door. His sweet words were like stinging my ear. \" Your cousin\" I replied and watched his reaction. His eyes darkened, his jaw clenched but he did a good job by trying to keep a blank face.\nI stretched forth my hands towards me \"Shall we?\" I asked. He glared at my hands before taking it.\nHis guards and maid followed us at our back as we made our way towards the hall. The crowd's shouts increased as we walked in. We both waved our hands to them.\nThen the eerie feeling crept in. The hair at the back of my neck stood, and goosebumps crept into my body. Someone was watching me or rather, Finn was watching me.\nWe sat in our seats beside each other. Dean kept his hands enclosed in mine throughout the time and it caused me great difficulty to move or do anything.\nI leaned towards his ear and whispered \"You are making me feel uncomfortable\" I replied.\nHe smiled his attention still on the wonderful dancers who were entertaining us. \"You are my wife lia, a fact you seem to have forgotten so I will do everything to remind you of it even if it means holding your hands throughout the event. You need to get that infatuation you feel towards Luca away\" he replied harshly.\nI scoffed and smiled. Whatever he was trying to do was not going to get to me. \n\"If this is your attempt to deceive me into thinking that you are jealous. Then I would love to tell you that you have failed drastically\" I replied.\nHe tightened his grip around me. Sooner than later the dancers stopped dancing and they started playing classical music.\nHe took my hands and led me to the dance floor. My feet grew cold as all the eyes fell on me.\nHe wrapped his arm around my waist and drew me closer to himself. \"What are you trying to do?\" I asked him.\n\"Trying to win my wife over,\" he said with a smile. An uneasy feeling crept into my core.\nWe danced for a while, and everyone's eyes rested on us. Then he drew me closer and whispered.\n\"I don't give two fucks about whatever is going on between you and Luca but it has to stop. If it does not stop I will have his neck for it. You are my wife and it is time you start performing your duty and that includes bearing my kids' 'he whispered harshly.\nI chuckled a little to hide the anger that was building within me.\nImmediately the songs stopped. I walked towards my seat without wasting any more time. I raised my eyes and it locked with Finn down.\nI groaned in frustration and took a glass of wine from the servant.\nMy heartbeat increased, and anger welled up within me. How dare he threaten me with Luca's life.\n\"May I talk to you?\" he said and dragged my hands towards the door. As he dragged me my head started spinning, his arms wrapped around my waist. \"Easy girl. I need you to be alive. I like loud lively moans\" he whispered against my ear and at that moment I knew that I had been drugged.",

        "content": "Lia pov\nEasy girl. I need you to be awake. I like loud lively moans\" Dean whispered against my ear his voice was filled with loathe.\nCold crept into my feet, and my heartbeat increased faster than I expected. I tried to free myself from his grip but he tightened his grip around my waist and his nails dug painfully into my skin.\n\"Let me go, you fucking bastard,\" I said lowly which annoyed me because I wanted to shout but it came out as a whisper.\nHe chuckled before he drew me to himself, he raised my chin with his two middle fingers making me look at him. \"Did you think I was joking about you having babies for me?\" He asked with a chill emotionless voice. His alcoholic breath hit my nose making me look away.\nHow the hell did I have a child for him? I knew if I did not leave now there would be no going back and besides my eyelids were getting heavier and I felt like a sack of sand. Too heavy to walk alone.\nFuck! Each time Luca was not around something always happened to me. And I was always helpless. If I did not act fast he would have his way with me and no one, not even Finn, would save me. The only person who could do that had traveled.\nHe resumed walking me to his room when one of the guests came, \"Alpha dean!\" He shouted.\nHe was an Alpha from another pack. \"How is your Luna feeling?\" He asked. I wanted to tell him that I was not fine and that he was about to rape me but then again my mouth felt too heavy. \nAnd even if I talked to them they would not even believe me because he was my husband he had the right to have me at any time he wanted without any sort of refusal.\nHe called a guard to come \"Take her to the room\" he said. The guard nodded and walked me to his room and locked me inside.\nI dragged whatever energy I had within me and went to the bathroom. I stuck my two middle fingers into my throat for a while until all my food rushed down to the toilet together with the wine.\nDid it help? Maybe a little bit. But I still felt sleepy. I flushed the toilet before he could come and sat on the bed, gradually sleeping helped me. I fell on the bed.\nA few minutes or hours later my eyes opened. My head was banging seriously and for a moment my vision was blurry. Then everything reduced gradually and then the memories of the few hours ago played around my head.\nPanic spread through me. I quickly stood up searching around me. A sigh of relief escaped me when I looked at my clothes and they were still intact. My eyes glanced around the room, I saw a dagger by the side of the bed and picked it up, shoving it into my pocket.\nThe door opened and Dean walked inside. He glanced at me and licked his lips before he closed the door. I sat up watching him as he took off his shirt.\nHe walked towards me \"You are such an obedient girl. You managed to stay awake just like I ordered\" he said with a dirty smirk.\nBile welled up within me at the sound of his voice. He was so irritating. \"You would be a bastard if you think I would let you touch me\"\nHe narrowed his eyes to me. Confusion watched his face then it washed away replacing it with a blank face. Fear crept into me. His eyes darkened \"Well, for starters\" he said pulling his trousers \"My father is dead so I am practically a bastard\" he said with a smile and said, \"How the hell are you lucid?\" He asked me.\nI shrugged and got up \"This is not going to happen,\" I said trying to control whatever suicidal emotions within me because if we were sincere I wanted to kill him. right now like slit his throat.\nImmediately I walked past him and he grabbed my arms and dragged me back, shoving me on the bed.\n\"I am your husband and I am going to do anything I want to do with you\" he growled as he let go of his boxers leaving him fully naked.\nHe moved towards his drawer and opened one of his drawers. A gasp escaped me at the sight of what I saw. handcuffs, belts, vibrators, and other sexual material. A shiver ran through my spine.\nIf I allow him to handcuff me then I will be powerless and have nothing to do. I immediately brought out the knife and pointed it towards him.\nHe scoffed when he saw what I did. He did not feel touched by the incident. \"Don't do something stupid. If that knife touches me I am going to be more brutal than I want to be\" he warned, his eyes growing darker.\nI tightened my grip on the knife. I held onto it like I held it into my knife. He threw his handcuffs into his bed. He advanced towards me, completely naked. I rolled my eyes in disgust. Luca's dick was bigger than his.\n\"If you come close I am going to cut you\" I warned even though my voice was shaky I tried to be bold. My heartbeat fastened as he advanced towards me. Immediately my skin touched the cold wall I knew I was done for.\nHe stood right in front of me with a grin \"Do it lia, stab me\" he ordered.\nIn that position, I knew I could not stab him. I did not have the mind or whatever it took to stab him.\nHe slowly took the knife from me and threw it on the bed. He grabbed me by my arms and threw me on his bed.\nGosh! This can't be happening. Tears flowed freely from my eyes.\nBang!Bang! Someone was trying to open his door. He stopped on track and hissed in anger. \"Raphael tells that person that the Alpha is busy,\" he said.\nThere was no response. Using the opportunity. I shouted, \"Somebody help me!\" He glared at me covering my mouth with a large palm.\nBang! And the door flew open. A familiar scent hit me, it was Luca. His blue eyes met mine for a while and I smiled with gratitude. He smiled back before he advanced on Dean and drove his fist into him.\n\"How dare you touch her!\" He shouted. As he advanced he drove more blows into his face. Dean fell on the floor.\nHe advanced towards me and carried me in bridal style towards his room and laid me on his bed.",

Anger welled up at the thought of her finding it difficult to know who she belonged to. Even though I told her I would not let her mate,  even though all I had done was to protect her from my brothers and enemies.\nTo make matters worse Merlin called me his father and I can swear my heart melted at the thought of being Merlin's dad. My heart melted at the thought of owning Lia and everything she had.\nIt was easy for me. Even if they had told me to choose between my mate and her I would gladly choose her. However, I felt a pang of pain when I discovered that she was not my mate because I was drawn to her rather than Jenny, my mate.\nTo cool off whatever ache within me I decided to go and visit my mother's mother or Sabrina. Anybody that would help me nurse my wounded heart.\nWhen she had knocked on my door I had made up my mind to act like I did not care. To make her afraid of losing me just like the way I was afraid of losing her and trust me it was working until water gathered her eyes and I knew I had hurt her more than I wanted to.\nI just had to pacify her. Then I walked away. I was on my way to the outskirts of the pack when Sabrina texted me telling me to come to her house. It is very urgent to read the text message.\nI knocked on her door twice before she opened it. She was wearing a blue long-sleeve gown with her usual necklace made of coral beads. She smiled at me and stepped aside for me to come in.\nI breezed in with my normal pride \"What is it you wanted to tell me that was so urgent\" I asked impatiently. It irritated me that  I was still in this place.\nShe smiled and walked towards the kitchen and returned with a cup of tea. I glared at her then at the tea \"On a scale of one to ten, how much poison did you put into this tea?\"I asked her.\nShe smiled and sat down on her couch \"You are still useful to me so don't be afraid. By the way, where are you going?\" she asked.\nI shrugged and sat on her chair \"Going to meet my grandmother\"\nShe smiled \"Awwn, is there trouble at Love Island?\" She asked.\nI rolled my eyes in disgust. Of course, she knew I quarreled with Lia. \"What do you want?\" I asked her.\n\"Nothing, just want you to go back to the palace,\" she said with a stern voice.\nI raised my eyebrow. Don't tell me she called you just to tell me to go to the palace. Why did she not tell me on the phone or maybe she knew I was not going to obey her? Witches are a pain in my ass. \"Why should I?\" I asked her with nonchalance. \nShe smiled as she sipped her tea making a throaty noise \"You haven't drunk your tea\" she said gesturing at the filled cup that I had laid on her table. \"Are you still afraid that I am going to poison you?'' she added, her voice laced with teasing.\nI pressed my lips together stopping myself from spilling whatever I had in mind. I looked at my wristwatch, impatience was rumbling within me. I took the tea and sipped a little.\n\"Sabrina,\" I called sternly. She raised her eyebrow in feigned ignorance. I rolled my eyes in anger.\n\"Lovers do quarrel. It does not mean you would treat her like trash and leave. Your brother is holding a party for her and I promise you that if you don't get there early. You are going to blame yourself for whatever happened, \"she warned.\n\"First we are not lovers and if you are talking about lia. Dean is her husband he can do whatever he wants with her\" I replied nonchalantly even though it felt forbidden to call Dean her husband.\nAnd I cared so much for whatever he did to her but I was not a toy or a bodyguard to her. I needed her to value my presence to appreciate it.\nShe smiled at me \"We both know that is a lie.\" She said I hated the fact that she was telling the truth. \"Well, if you don't Lia might end up getting raped by your cousin or even get killed\" she added and watched my reaction.\nMy jaw tightened at the thought of coming back and discovering that Lia was dead or that she was raped by Dean. My reaction would be bloody. I might as well kill him.\nI glared at her \"If you happen to be lying I would kill you with my own hands\" I warned as I stood up.\nA little chuckle escaped her lips. \"You can't harm me.\" She said and opened the door for me.\nI glared at her once more before I entered my car and drove away. I sped up towards the palace. I met a large crowd outside eating and drinking.\nEveryone created a path for me as I entered. Of course, everyone knew how brutal I could be or maybe they still saw me as the forbidden one who killed their Luna. Either way, it was their business and not mine.\nI beckoned Ava one of Lia's maids. \"Where is your Luna?\" I asked.\n\"She went with the Alpha to his room\" she informed me, fear lacing her voice, her shoulders tightened with hesitation.\n\"What are you hiding? Tell me, I won't tell anyone\" I said.\n\"She was drunk. She went with the Alpha to his bed\" she said.\nI nodded and left her advancing towards the Dean's room. His bodyguards stood there. I tried to knock but they stopped me. \n\"The Alpha is busy with his Luna,\" he said with triumph in his voice. I smiled, he has always been a loyal twat.\nI brought out my knife and stabbed one, then I snapped Raphael's neck.\n\"Help!\" Lia screamed. My desperation increased. The door was tightly locked. I kept on hitting the door with my full weight until it opened.\nBlood filled my vision at the sight. Lia was lying on the bed with tear-stained eyes with a naked Luca. He was obviously forcing himself on her.\nShe smiled when she saw me and at that moment all the anger I had toward her washed away. It was replaced with anger, I made up my mind that the next time he would do such a thing I would kill him. I don't care how the pack would see me.",

His eyes dropped to my lips as his eyes darkened. I licked my dry lips. His shoulder tended at my gesture. I prayed within me that he would just put everything behind me and kiss me.\n\"Fuck!\" He cursed under his breath as his eyes drew from mine. He dropped his head in the crook of my neck. His hot breath fanned my neck, sending shivers down my spine. \n\"Did he touch you?\" He asked his head still on my neck. \n\"Answer me lia\" he pleaded quietly and planted a soft kiss on my neck.\nI shook my head carefully, afraid of what he might snap out of this moment.\n\"Words lia, words\" he growled.\n\"No, but he almost did. '' I answered quietly. He remained quiet, taking in my scent. My body grew warm with anticipation. He started planting kisses from my neck back to my lips. He stopped at the corner of my lips and raised his head a little bit. The space between us was so small that if I raised my head just a little bit his lips would meet with mine.\nOur gaze locked with each other screaming a strange feeling of lust, desire, and love. No, not love. We have not even gotten there. He was still angry with me; he was just acting on his impulse.\nHe did not want me, he only wanted someone to be his bed even though a feeling within me knew whatever he said was not true.\nHis lips touched mine as warmth spread through my body. I shivered at how soft his lips felt on mine. How could I get over these soft lips? His tongue lingered around my lips for a while begging for entrance. I parted my lips slightly and he rushed inside roughly filled with a mixture of lust and anger.\nI wrapped my arms around his neck and snaked my hands around his hair, he groaned as my hands grappled his air. Then he stopped, and I could feel the tension rising. His breathing reduced.\nThen he stood up immediately, a cold laced my body replacing the warmth that I had felt earlier on. I groaned in frustration as I sat up. He stared at me intensely.\n\"Are you hurt?\" He asked with concern.\n\"I am fine,\" I replied curtly.\nAn awkward silence existed between us. He just sat on his table, his eyes fixed on me. I just looked at him with expectation.\nThen his words started repeating himself before me. \nI would risk my life for a maid as long as I could get her on my bed anytime I wanted. Gentlemen are normally kind to people, put that at the back of your mind the next time you decide to mistake kindness for love or lust. \nHe was just being kind. I repeated in my mind. I searched around in case I had forgotten something. I had to go before he would shamelessly order me to get out.\nI looked at him once more \"Thank you\" I mumbled and stood up to leave his room.\n\"Where do you think you are going to go?\" He asked stopping me on my track. What was he expecting? For me to wait till he rubbed it off on my face that I was an whore.\n\"I am going before you ask me to get out. Just preserving my little dignity\" I replied.\nHe swallowed hard before his eyes landed on mine. His eyes softened with remorse \"I was angry and you know it\" he said softly.\nI shrugged \"Oh really. It seems the men in the Attics family always spilled out things when they were angry. Whether it be his cousin or the Alpha himself\" he glared at me. \nI knew I had annoyed him with whatever I just said but I was tired of being tossed around and each cousin calling me a whore. The only difference was that Dean outrightly called me a whore, while Luca indirectly called me a whore.\n\"Don't ever compare me to Dean because we are not the same,\" he warned.\nI maintained eye contact with him. \"Oh really, because the last time I checked. He directly called me a whore while you indirectly called me one. The bottom line is that the both of you don't respect me, you just see me as a tool to use against your cousin while he sees me as a common piece that he can easily rape!\" I shouted at his face.\n\"I would have had you a long time ago if I was Dean, trust me\" he replied with some sort of pride.\nAnger mixed with frustration welled up within me. \"Then what is stopping you? I asked with a daring tone.\nI seriously did not know what I was doing, one minute I was angry and the next minute I was daring him to bed me.\nHe stood up making me stare at him, he pointed at my chest with his middle finger and for some reason, just the idea of his middle finger trapped in between my chest warmed me up. \"You, lia. You. Until you choose me I am not going to lay my hands on you no matter how hard I want to\"\nI stepped backward to take in his words. There was no time hiding it or thinking about it \"I chose you\" I said.\nA glint of joy passed through his eyes before he replaced it with a frown \"You are saying this because you are horny\" he replied.\n\"No, Luca. I mean every bit of what I just said. I have always wanted you\" I replied.\nI expected him to reply to me back or kiss me or take me to bed and fuck me till I lose my voice instead he asked me.\n\"What do you want?\"\n\"You\"\nHe shook his head \"I mean what do you want to do with Dean who almost raped you?\" He explained.\nAdrenaline rushed within me at the thought of what would have happened if he was not here.\nI looked at him back, this time my voice was filled with determination. \"I want his head\"",

        "content": "Dean's pov.\nI watched as Lorenzo threw his glass at the wall. The glass scattered on the floor. He turned to me, his nostrils flared with anger, his eyes were red and his veins throbbed out of his head.\n\"Why do you always have to scatter everything?\" He shouted at me. I rolled my eyes, it wasn't my fault that Lia was that attractive. My plan had been normal just to woo her into confiding in me.\nBut it was a long risky process,  plus I wasn't even sure she would ever trust me because I almost killed her and caused her much pain.\nWhen I went to see her yesterday afternoon she kept comparing me with Luca. He is better in bed, he is this, he is that, Aggh! It was getting into my head.\nTo make matters worse she was staring at me with those pink-filled lips and all I could imagine was her perfect full lips around my cock. Taking my whole length in and licking the cum of me and I knew this was not possible so I tried another way. I wonder why Lorenzo was angry, I mean he also forced himself into his mate's life.\nI shrugged \"I don't see why you are angry. I was just trying to have sex with my wife\" I replied, playing with the black pen in my hand.\nWe were currently in my office. After that wanker called Luca left with Lia I locked my door. I knew Lorenzo would be next and I did not have time for his lecture. I had bruises all over my face. I did not need his old-school lecture.\n\"You were trying to rape her Dean!\" He shouted, slamming his hands on my table. \"You fucking spiked her drink. How did you want her to feel tomorrow? I made myself clear to win her over not make her hate you\"\nI shook my head and gulped down my drink \"She kept on comparing me with Luca even if she had not had sex with me. I just wanted her to have a taste of me to see if he will still have her within his grasp\"\n\"Have you gone mad?\" He asked, his voice laced with utter disbelief.\nI shook my head and stood up walking towards him \"Nah, I am just tired of trying to win her over. If Luca had not interrupted us I would have been able to fuck some sense into her\" I said with a smile.\nHe glared at me intensively, he curled his hands into a fist and drove it into my cheek. I staggered for a while \"Everything does not have to involve sex Dean\"\nI straightened up even though my jaw was screaming in pain. I could confidently say I had received enough blows for this week. My face was already swollen. How would I face my people with this sort of face?\n\"That's where you are wrong, Enzo. She is wrapped around his finger because he is good in bed. She is an immature whore. If she had me she would know there is a great difference\"\nHe looked at me with disgust. I heaved a sigh and raised my hands in submission \"Fine I was wrong but it was not entirely my fault. I'm sorry\" I said.\nHe glared at me once more \"That should be for Lia and not me \" he corrected. I nodded my head.\nI knew I had fucked up but I seriously wanted Lia. Even though it would make her my lifetime enemy. Wanted to see what was so special about her that made Luca act this way. He fucking killed my bodyguard to save her. Luca had never been this protective even with  Jenny, his mate. \n\"What do we do?\" I asked with an exhausted tone.\nLorenzo shook his head \"I don't know. Seriously, you got everything so fucked up. Maybe you can try striking an alliance with Sabrina\"\nA little laughter escaped my mouth \"Seriously, the only alliance Sabrina wants is for the witches to live with us\" I pointed out.\n\"Then maybe you could just allow them\" I rolled my eyes. \"Think about it Dean, she is the only leverage they have against us. If we have her on our side we can win\" he explained.\n\"Well, no. The witches hate us and could kill us if we allow them. Betrayal flows in their vein\" I said and added \"Besides Luca wants my woman, not my throne\"\nLorenzo laughed \"That is the dumbest thing you have said since I knew you\"\nI knew, but did he want my throne? He has never claimed my throne any day. He wanted me dead for his mate and then for Lia but never on my throne.\n\"Look, Dean, we need the witches on your side,\" he said in a more serious tone.\nI nodded \"I know-\nA knock on the door interrupted our discussion. Lorenzo rolled his eyes to suppress his anger.\n\"Come in,\" I ordered.\nA guard came inside with a letter. \"Who sent it?\" I asked. I was not expecting any letter.\n\"It is from Finn,\" the guard said.\nImmediately he called Finn's name Lorenzo and snatched the letter from his hands. He quickly opened it.\n\"You can go,\" I told the guard.\nWe stared at the letter and read it together.\n\"I know you are aware of the fact that your Luna is my mate and I wish to take her as soon as possible considering the marks you have inflicted on her. For the next three days take care of her and make sure that she is alright. If you aren't prepared to make countless wolves, hybrids, and witches your enemy.\n                                        Yours sincerely\n                                          Finn\"\nLorenzo smiled at me and said \"The game is about to begin\"",

If he meant his taking my wife would be in his favor, then I was not interested. It would be an insult to our park, and it might lead to war.\nI can order him to reject her, although that was near impossible because he was an Alpha, plus it would be inhuman to order someone to reject his mate.\n\"It would weaken Luca's thirst against us, and we will be in power once again,\" Lorenzo implied.\nI shook my head. \"If you think I am going to let Lia go just like that, then you would be joking,\" I said without mincing words.\nLorenzo's face turned blank. \"Why?\"\nI shrugged as I walked back to my seat. \"She is my wife; if she goes, the pack would be without a Luna, which is not good for the pack,\" I explained.\nLuna grabbed a chair and sat on the chair \"Who told you that the absence of a Luna is bad for the park?\" He asked.\n\"Look-\" I began\n\"Your mother died and the park ruled just fine. No one was affected except her immediate family\"\nWhatever he said was true, but I was looking at the future harm it might cause the park. \nLuca might decide to fight back and even attack the park. He was a restless rogue, and he had killed Lia. He would not bother to kill more for her.\nAnd the idea of lia being with Finn did not sit down with me. He had a rough way of living. I agree that all wolves are rogue but his own was worse. \n\"Except you have started falling for her,\" Lorenzo said, his eyes narrowed to a split.\nI sighed as I rubbed my heels with my hands. How the hell did I end up with someone this stupid? How would he think I was falling for her?\nIrritation laced my face. \"Eww, why would you say such a thing? I am thinking about the park security and nothing else,\" I replied, admonishing his thoughts.\nI could never fall for Lia. She was annoying, always finding a way to crawl into my skin. Either by disobeying me or by reminding me of how incompetent I was compared to Luca.\nI never knew she was that into Luca until yesterday when she managed to rub all her fantasies on my face. \nI wonder how Luca managed to win the hearts of girls into being faithful to him. Every girl I tried to get close to always saw me as a means to an end.\nTo either become the Luna OE or gain favor from my father for her father. \nMy mind raced back to Lia's full pink lip. My groin increased in anticipation. I was going to have her before Finn took her away, even if it meant harming Luca.\n\"Dean!Dean!\" Lorenzo called but it sounded far off.\nHe tapped my hands bringing me back to reality, making me flinch a little bit. \"Did you hear what I said?\" He asked, his voice laced with excitement.\nI shook my head as I sat up and faced him. \"Sorry, what did you say?\"I asked.\nHe narrowed his eyes. \"What were you thinking about?\"\nI was thinking about how I was going to make Lia give in to me willingly. Was I going to tell him? No.\n\"Nothing,\" I said with a finality tone.\nHe watched me for a while before he began \"I was thinking about forming an alliance with Sabrina against Luca\" \nI groaned in frustration. He was always seeking the help of the witches knowing fully well that they hated us. They almost killed my parents.\nAllying with Sabrina would be the dumbest idea.\n\"Listen to me. We still have three days to rub it off on Luca's face that Finn is going to take his lover. We would instigate him into fighting with Finn. And we all know that he is a rogue. Finn will come with his armed men, and together we will kill him,\" he explained.\nI nodded. It was a perfect idea. But then again, that was not what I wanted. If I could make Luca surrender without killing him I would happily do that. He was my cousin after all.\nAnd before Jenny came into the picture, we were good friends. I knew he would retaliate if Finn took her. Maybe I would stab him for a week or more.\n\"What if he does not fight with Finn? I mean Luca is a cunning person. You can't know his next move. He might want Lia, but he would take her in another way,\" I said.\n\"If he does not fight him then it would be a good course. After all, he does not want your throne.\" He said with a shrug.\nMy eyes fell on the letter. I took it and smiled at Lorenzo. He returned the smile knowing my next move.\nI stood up and made my way to Lia's room. I was sure he had dropped her there. Lorenzo followed me to my back.\nI knocked on Lia's door, but there was no response. I knocked again before moving to Luca's door.\nAnger filled me at the thought of seeing them together, but then again, I was holding greater news.\nI knocked on the door. Luca half opened the door. He was wearing sweatpants but had a bare chest.\nHe narrowed his eyes \"What do you want?\" He asked.\nA smile tugged my lips. I stretched forth the letter. He glared at the letter and then at me.\n\"What is this?\" He asked with anger.\n\"A Letter from your lover's mate,\" I replied.\nHe glanced at me and then at the letter. His jaw clenched.\nHe took the letter and banged the door against me.\nLorenzo tapped my shoulders. \"Step one is done\".",

        "content": "Luca's pov\nWhen I asked Lia what she wanted. I thought she was going to tell me to stab Dean or make him pay or maybe wait till he got his mate but what she told me today surprised me a lot. Not in a bad way. In a good way, I was proud of her.\nIt was really surprising that she had requested his head\" she said.\nA gasp escaped my mouth but I quickly shielded it. It would grow her ego if she found out that she managed to make me.\n\"What?\" I asked in a whisper. My hands were on my waist as I walked to her.\nShe stared at me with her blue eyes, and for some stupid reason, the sight of her eyes caused warmth to the bottom of my belly.\nShe opened her mouth again to spill out the formidable word \"I want his head\" she said again.\n\"I want him to suffer for trying to rape me, for trying to kill me or even killing me while you were away. For inflicting injury on me for no reason\" she added her voice filled with disgust and rage.\n\"But he is your son's father. If we kill him your son can't lay claim to the throne\" I explained trying to make her see reasons with me.\nI knew if she begged me she would convince me to do it even though I did not want to. Up until now, I have never thought of killing Dean. Even when he killed my mate, I saw it as collateral damage, a quick escape so I killed his mother instead.\nAnd even when I had the power to kill him I did not. For example, I did not drag the white stake out of his head. \nIf I did he would die and part of me did not want that. He was my cousin and a good friend before Jenny's incident and I did not sum up for becoming an Alpha.\nI would never qualify to be one. To the pack, I was a rogue, and rogues don't become Alpha except they found their group of rogues and decided to head them.\nI can't also become an Alpha with my hybrid nature. They would see me as forbidden.\n\" That does not matter. He has never been in Merlin's life and besides Merlin now sees you as his father\" she added in a more convincing tone.\nWhen Merlin called me father, I was not angry even if I appeared to be angry before Lia. I was happy.\nIt made me want to be a dad. He might have had a striking resemblance with Dean but he had our family eyes and hair.\nI shook my head \"If he dies the pack will have no ruler\" \nShe stood up to me, her warm body coming in contact with my cold body. \"You can be the pack leader,\" she said as she moved her hands towards my chest.\nIn moments like this, thinking was impossible, not when her hands were crawling around my chest, not when she stopped at my nipple and gave it a tight squeeze.\nShe moved her hands to my shoulders and wrapped her arms around my shoulders. \"Think about it. You as my Alpha and the Alpha of the people and me as your Luna\" she whispered slowly.\nNothing pleased my ear than me being her Alpha and her being my Luna. \n\"I would think about it,\" I said with a growl.\nA smile tugged her lips \"Good boy\" \nWhat the hell! Did she just call me a good boy? If I was in my normal sense, I would be angry. I was not a boy, I was a man and it sounded belittling.\nBut coming from Lia, it had another impact on my body and my brain. My cock was getting bigger and all I found myself thinking about was bending her over and fucking the hell out of her.\nMy eyes moved to her full pink lips and I fought the urge to go away. But I knew I would not be able to.\nI was already filled with desire and lust. I groaned and moved my eyes away. We were talking about something serious.\nSuch a thing was not meant to happen. \"Luca,\" she called out in a low voice.\n\"Yes,\" I answered, looking at her eyes and not her whole face so that I wouldn't find myself wanting to kiss her again.\n\"Kiss me,\" she said in a pleading tone.\nAnd just like that, all the morals and patience I had was gone. I smashed my lips into her own.\nClaiming her soft lips. I  bit her lips a little as my tongue begged for entrance. She finally opened her mouth. Her sweet cinnamon warmth drove desire down my groin.\nA moan escaped her lips. Her tongue fought with mine fighting for dominance for a while. A smile tugged my lips; I couldn't believe Lia was finally fighting for Dominance.\nI left her mouth and started planting kisses on her neck, and her collarbone. Moans escaped her lips, exciting me the more.\nI returned to her lips as I moved my hands to her breast. Her gown was still on. She quickly turned around while I helped her zip down. The gown fell on the floor revealing her bra top and her underwear\nI stood at a distance as she removed her underwear. Her hands slowly moved to her bra top.\n\"Stop\" I ordered. Her nipples were already pointed out and I wanted to tease her for a while, fondling her nipples while she begged for my tongue.\nShe walked towards me again, and I claimed her in a hot, intimate kiss. I moved my hands down her nipples and pinched it a little.\nA moan escaped her and a cracked smile tugged my lips. Good. I would make her want me, make her beg for my touch, and only when I am satisfied would my lips excite her nipples.",

God, I wanted his tongue on my skin anywhere but not my mouth. I wanted him to lips my nipple till I cum but for some reason, he avoided direct contact with my nipples.\nHe just played with them, making me anticipate and this anticipation was driving me crazy.\n\"Luca..\" I begged. He looked at me with a devilish grin and continued. He sure as hell knew what he was doing. \nHe finally moved his tongue to my nipple. I heaved a sigh of relief as he made his way towards my bra. He would finally unlock it and give me the pleasure I wanted, but contrary to my expectations.\nHe used his tongue to caress my nipple through my bra. Making my nipple harden the more.\nAnother moan escaped my lips. After a while, he kissed his way back to my neck planting soft wet kisses on my neck while his other hand found his way to my pants.\nBy the time he got there,, I was sure my pants were soaked from all the crazy teasing. He felt my wetness, moved his hands up and down around my pants, and then attempted to remove his hands, but I held it. My eyes widened with pleading. He glared at me as I mouthed, please.\nHis eyes darkened \"If you want to cum free my hands\" he ordered.\nAnd just like that I released his hand, allowing myself to be at his mercy once more.\nHe finally moved his hands behind my back and unclasped my bra, freeing my pointed pink nipples. He stared at it for a while before he moved his hands to my pants and helped me pull it away. Tossing it into a place I was not sure of.\nHis eyes darkened as they filled with desire and luck. His stare made me feel like the only person there, the only thing around me.\nHe kissed me again before his lips moved to my nipples. His mouth finally encircled my nipple, his warmth exciting me the more.\nFinally, his tongue touched my nipples. Loud moans of pleasure escaped my mouth as his tongue played with it, while his other hands played with the other one.\nHe bit it a little not and then hard. Nipples of pleasure pressed through my skin.\nHe moved his mouth to the other one and repeated the same circle. Sooner than later the room echoed with my moans.\nHe picked me up and carried me to his bed and laid me there. He knelt before me and muttered \"Beautiful\" A pink hue covered my cheeks. We were finally going to have sex.\nHe launched towards me and planted soft kisses down my navel until it stopped at my Virgina.\nHe went below and started kissing his way up there. I moaned with expectation. \nHe planted soft kisses on my left thigh then licked my clit just once and moved to the right one.\nThen he stopped and looked at me. His eyes bore into my soul.\n\"If I fuck you lia, I am going to be the only man that is permitted to touch you\" \nI nodded with anticipation; I doubted if anyone would make me feel this way again.\n\"Words, lia.\"\n\"No one would touch me,\" I said in a whisper.\n\"You will be mine and mine alone\" he ordered.\nWhat he did not know is that I have been his own since the day he kissed me. I touched myself at night with his face on my mind and I sometimes moaned his name just because I always had a pillow over my mouth.\n\"I will be yours,\" I said.\n\"Not Finn and not Dean. Mine. And If you ever let your mate touch you because of the mate bond. I would kill him not minding if it would cause a war between the two parks,\" he warned. His voice is deep with possessiveness.\nI nodded even though I was told the mate bond was stronger than the normal one. That was not my business anymore.\nWith that, he came back to my thighs and planted soft kisses all along. His tongue finally touched my clit.\nHe licked me up taking in all my juice, then he thrust his hands into my pussy.\n\"Arr..gh\" a loud moan escaped my lips. Maybe it was because it had been a long time since I had sex.\n\"Luca\" I called out as I came close to Cummings. One last thirst with a scream came and he licked me up.\nHe removed his grey sweat pants revealing his full length to me.\nI gasped. It was even bigger than I thought. What the fuck? How was that going to fit into my hole?\n\"Kneel\" he ordered.\nI quickly knelt and took his whole length into my mouth little by little until I was okay with his length.\nThen I started sucking him. He groaned as he closed his eyes and laced his hands on top of my hair, grabbing it.\nWith time, he started driving deeper and deeper. I could feel his length widen. He was about to cum.\nThen he filled my lips with hot liquid. I swallowed everything in and licked the little ones off his dick.\n\"Good girl,\" he muttered. I laid back on his bed and watched as he thrust into my Virgina.\nI gasped as I tried to take his full length. I closed my eyes for a while. Then he removed it and slid in slowly until I was comfortable before he increased his pace.\n\"Luca..l\" I called out. I was close to Cumming.\nHe let me cum, I cummed thrice before he cum and fell on me.\nWe were both breathing heavily before our breath steadied. He planted a soft kiss on my lips and murmured,, \"You are amazing\", before he rolled to the other side and drew me closer for a cuddle.\nAfter a while, a knock came on the door. We both murmured. Who the hell was that?\nLuca opened the door,, and when he came back,, his face was carrying a frown.\nI immediately knew that something was amiss.",

She had my type of desire.\nWe sometimes organized threesomes together with a harlot from the brothel but with Lia it was different.\nIt was as if she was made only for me. Yes, there were times in the past when I imagined what our first sex together would be like.\nBut this experience was more than my expectations. It was as if she was wholly made for me.\nEverything about her. Her smile, her nipple, her pussy, her moans, and, everything fucking thing which she was made up of.\nWe lay peacefully on the bed after the mind-blowing sex. A smile tugged my lips at the thought of making sure she knew who she was.\nDean was quite lucky that I had not had sex with her before he tried to touch her because I could guarantee you that if it was now.\nI would have killed him outrightly. She belonged to me and no one else. The moon goddess would be damned if she thought I would let go of her because she mated her to someone else.\nSpeaking of her mate Finn, I have to find a way to convince him to leave Lia alone or, better still, kill him without leaving any trace behind.\nA knock on the door interrupted our peaceful moment. We stayed the same way, not bothering to move.\nThe knock came again but we stayed. \"Are you not going to answer your visitor?\" She asked.\nI shook my head. No, if I did. They might bring news that will scatter our joy. Talking from experience our union never lasted before a storm came and I was getting used to that fact.\n\"When they are tired of knocking they will go \"I assured her and buried my head in her neck.\nThe knock came again on the door and I squeezed her tighter not wanting to leave her warmth. A laughter escaped her lips  \" Luca just open the door and see who it is\"\nI groaned in frustration. Being a prince was tiring. You would have to keep being disrupted whether a higher authority wanted to see you needed your presence for something or wanted to deliver a message.\nIt was seriously frustrating and now I had to leave my comfort zone for it. I looked at the beautiful smile on her face and planted a kiss.\nThe kiss lasted longer than expected; warmth had already started feeling in my body before it stopped me.\nI heaved a sigh as I wore my grey sweatpants. I was never going to get enough of her.\nI walked towards the door and opened it expecting to see a guard or someone else. My frown deepened when I saw Dean.\n\"What do you want?\" I asked not to try to hide my displeasure.\nA smile tugged on his lips and my irritation increased. Seriously, does he have to be this annoying? He stretched forth his hands with a piece of paper written.\nI glared at him and then at the paper. \"What is this?\" I asked.\n\"A letter from your lover's mate,\" he said.\nMy heart stopped beating for a while. What could be in this letter? I looked at Dean to see a mocking smile on his face.\nI slammed the door on his face. I opened the letter and began to read.\n Colour drenched my skin at the Letter. Anger mixed with dark possessives wrapped around my insides. Who the hell did he think he was to give us three days?\nLia sat up immediately and she saw my face. I guessed she knew something was wrong.\n\"Is everything okay?\" She asked, covering her breast with a blanket.\nI threw the letter at her and lay beside her. She read the letter quickly and turned to me.\n\"He is giving us a three-day ultimatum?\" She asked. I nodded.\nPain tightened around my throat. Why did the moon goddess have to be cruel? Why not plant the both of us together as mates? After all, it's been a while since I have lost my mate.\nI was meant to have a second chance mate. Everybody did, so why did my case have to be different?\nAdrenaline rushed within me. I could not bear the thought of losing her. Her being my cousin's wife was different. At least I got to see her and talk to her.\nBeing away felt like hell. It was as if a hole was plugged into my heart.\nShe placed her soft palm on my chest as she caressed my shirt. Gradually my body returned to normalcy.\n\"I have already made a promise to you. I will be with you and not with Finn. When that day comes with you by my side, I will deny him, and it will be over,\" she assured me.\nMy heart warmed at her promises \"Are you sure?\" I asked my voice soft with vulnerability. Gosh! I hated being vulnerable, but Lia was worth it.\nShe nodded with a smile \"Yes, babe,,\" she said.\nI turned my attention to her as my eyes widened. \"Did you just call me babe?\" I asked, unsure of what I had just heard.\nShe nodded with a smile. \"Yes,\" she said and rested her head on my chest.\nI  smiled, satisfied with her words. Things were getting better. She now showed that she also wanted me as much as I wanted her.\nA smile tugged my lips as I tickled her. She burst into laughter. Her sweet laughter filled the room, sounding like a rhythm to my ears.\nAfter a while the laughter died down and she looked at me \"I am never going to leave you\"\nIt was not just a statement. It was a promise.",

He is angry with the arrangement even though I am also angry with the arrangement\n\"You do know that keeping Lia is giving Luca more reason to eliminate you,\" he said,d, his voice with concern.\nI nod. Maybe Luca would one day gain the mind to kill me but I don't think he has that ambition right now.\n\"Luca has ambitions, but I doubt if it is for the throne. He has had serval times to kill me but he let me go\"\n\"I know but-\nA knock on the door interrupts our discussion. I groan as I sit upright. Who could that be?\n\" come in\" I shout.\nA guard strolls in and bows \"The elders are here to see me\"\nThat's strange. The elders only summon the Alpha when there is something bad going on. Is there a crop disease or a foretold bad omen?\n\"All of them?\" Lorenzo ask. Of course, he is also as surprised as I am. \nThe guard nods. \"Yes, Beta.\" Lorenzo nods and waves his hands, dismissing him away.\nHe turned to me. \"Why do you think they ask for us?\" He asks. He always dreads the council meeting.\nHe saw it as a waste of time and the elders were always trying to go through the most peaceful way. Something that Lorenzo found very annoying. He has always loved violence, to him. It is the best way to eliminate something.\nI take in a heavy breath. \"I don't know.\" I stand up and start arranging my desk.\nLorenzo follows me at my back.\nImmediately we get to the conference hall. They all stand up and bow at me, every single one of them except the power-drunk Sabrina.\n\"I never knew we have two Alphas under one room,\" I say as they sit down, glaring at Sabrina.\nShe returns it with a smile.  Witches are a pain in the ass.\n\"Forgive me your Highness. Witches are observing a fast. We don't bow to anyone, and secondly, I do not know why I am here because I am not a member of the council. So, if it pleases the Alpha can you tell me why I am here?\" She asked ed, her voice laced with amusement.\nOf course, she is not observing any sort of fast. She just takes pleasure in annoying me.\n\" I don't know. We would wait for Ares to tell us,\" I reply, facing Ares.\n\"Oh, and I thought the Alpha gets involved in everything that is happening around the people,\" she murmur loud enough for everyone to hear.\nI glare at her. \"Are you suggesting that the Alpha is inattentive about the needs of his people? Enzo asks in a deep, angry voice.\n\" I don't know. He is meant to know about everything that happens around us,\" she defended.\nThe whole council remained silent. If it was someone else, their head would be on a spike by now. But it was Sabrina, one enchantment and you are gone.\n\"I understand, but I have been busy with more pressing matters,\" I defend myself. I would not let her get what she wants.\nShe nods as if she understands whatever I just said. \"Busy with your wife, stabbing, or your cousin,\" she replies.\nI curl my hand into a fist. \"Tell me, what are you so busy with that you don't know about the bloodthirsty hybrid who feeds on our wolves, inflicting them with injuries?\" She asks.\nWhat? There has been a hybrid lurking around. I thought Enzo was pulling my legs when he told me, and now the best is inflicting injuries on people.\nI sit upright and stare at the people waiting for my decision. I have no experience with hybrids.\n\"We would find a hunter, and also, I would send troops to surround the pack. They would catch him\" I assure them.\n\"Send strong men. I have heard that once he senses the blood of werewolves, he makes sure he sucks them dry,\" Ares explains.\n\"Or we could ask Sabrina to track him down. He has his blood everywhere in the park. That was the reason we invited you, Sabrina. To help us,\" Ares says,s, his voice soft with a plead.\nA chuckle escaped Sabrina's lips. \"What would I get in return?\"\n\"A seat at the council\" \nShe waves her hand in the air. \"That would pass. Not attractive enough. Only if you allow my people in,\" she demands.\n\"Yes!\" Ares replies immediately but keeps quiet when he sees my glare.\nHe bows his head \"Sorry my Alpha. Is .. Is just that the people are scared. Twenty of us have been injured and seven of us died before we could do anything about it. If we let Sabrina in she would help us\" he explained trying to make me see reasons with him.\nI shake my head. I can't. The witches had disloyalty in their blood they might turn against us. I can't be inviting my enemy in.\nI look at Sabrina, who has a smile on her face. \"A seat on the council or nothing,\" I tell her.\nShe nods with a smile \"If Luca was offering me this position I would take it. Do you know why? Because he would make a better Alpha than you but if not. It's time I take my leave\" she says as she stands io and leaves.\nFury burns within me. Did she just imply that I am not good, Alpha?",

        "content": "Luca POV\nBefore Lia came into my life I had my good and bad days. There were some days where I was driven with utter range. Guess this range came from the way I was treated because I am a rogue.\nDiscovering I am a hybrid has been a curse and a blessing. A blessing because I was now stronger than those who mocked me. A curse because it was forbidden.\nI knew Lorenzo had tried once or thrice to convince Dean to kill me and he had refused. Because he feels that I am not a threat to him. But if he should discover that I am a hybrid, it would be the death of me.\nDuring those days of unending pain, I would drink to stupor or have brutal sex maybe fuck a girl who is having sex for the first time very hard.\nWas it a gruesome sight? Yes. Did it affect me in any way? Well, yes if you mean pleasure. The scream, the tears, the blood. It gave me pleasure that I could inflict pain on someone too.\nBut with lia appearance in my life, everything had changed. Just the sight of her and all my gruesome feelings washed away.\nI stare at my laptop in front of me. I can't believe I am the one doing this. I can't believe I am the one watching videos of me and her together.\nI click on the next video. We went out for skating and stopped to have ice cream. I shouted at her when I noticed that she had ice cream on my nose and allowed me to work around it.\nEver since the last time we made promises to each other, we have been going out more often. Doing things a couple does together including having the best sex every night. Her pants are still on the side of my bed from last night.\nA smile tugged at my lips at the thought of last night. I made sure she had orgasms like five times.\nA knock on the door interrupted my thought. I sit up straight as I try to hide the bulge that is already growing because of her.\n\"Come in\"\nThe door clicks open and Lia walks in with a smile. I smile back at her even though I have no idea why she is smiling.\nShe is wearing a blue trouser and a white sleeveless top. Her hair is packed into a high ponytail. She is holding my iPad on the other hand as she walks toward me.\nShe leans towards me and places a soft teasing kiss, leaving me begging for more.\" I have found the place where I think we should visit.\"\nI roll my eyes. She has been bent on making sure we visit a fancy place or I take her on a date. \nAt first, I refused because I was still her husband's cousin. It would make a bad impression if they see us together but after so much persuasion I agree. \"Where are we visiting?\" I ask.\n Her smile widened with anticipation \"Guess\".\nI heaved a sigh \" I am not good at guessing lia. Just tell me\" \n\"Just guess Luca. Don't be such a boring boyfriend \"\n \"Dominoes?\" \n\"No\" \n\"k&M?\" \n\"No\" she replied with a smile clearly enjoining the fact that I was failing. \n\"Rissa?\" \n\"NO!\" I roll my eyes. I have mentioned all the popular places in the park. What other place is there to mention? \n\"Please don't tell me it is a magna cinema. We can't have a date there and I hate watching movies\" \n\"Fine, since you could not guess a single puzzle I am going to help you, The Attics Museum!\" She shouts with a higher pitch.\nThe Museum? Why would she pick the Museum of all the places she could think of. I hate the Museum. It reminds me of things I would rather sweep under the closet.\n\"Luca! Luca\" she calls but her voice sounds far away. She taps my hands, bringing me from my thoughts. \"Don't you like the Museum?\" She asks.\nI nod and shake whatever dreadful feeling that is creeping up my skin. \"I am okay with it\" I answer.\nShe smiles \"I knew you would love it since you have decided that you hate all the fancy restaurants and besides I love the Museum\"\nAnd besides I love the Museum. Jenny once said this exact same word.\nA gust of wind filled my room. I furrowed my eyebrows as I looked at the window. The trees outside are calm. Then what is this?\n\"Aggh!\" Lia screamed. I turn around to see Sabrina standing before us. I glare at her as I use my fingers to smooth Lia's shoulders.\n\"Don't you think this could give someone a nightmare? Why would you just appear in front of my room like this?\" I ask with a calm angry tone.\n\"I would not visit you like this if it is not urgent,\" she says and looks at Lia \"Go\" she orders.\nI open my mouth to stop her and tell her that Lia is my girlfriend but she has already run away. She was obviously scared.\n\"I don't appreciate you barging into my room unexpectedly,\" I say with a bored expression.\n\"And I don't expect you to kill innocent people for fun?\"\nI narrow my eyes. \"For fun? What are you talking about?\" I ask.\n\"The news is everywhere. A hybrid is killing people. You are the only one of your kind left so why are you doing this?\" She asked. Her voice was laced with anger, I am sure if she could kill me she would have done that already.\n\"I. I did not kill anyone. Why would I do something as foolish as that?\" I ask.\nI can't seem to wrap my head around the fact that there is another hybrid. Who could it be?\n\"Oh don't lie to me!\" She snaps.\nI swallow hard \"I am not lying Sabrina. I would never lie to you.\"\nShe glared at me for a while before her expression softened. Seems she has discovered that I wasn't lying after all. \n\"Well, you need to be careful. If anyone finds out they would think you are the one and might even execute you\" she warns.\nI nod but I have to find that hybrid. It cannot be roaming around and hurting us.",

I glare at him.\n\" Is there no other way?\"Lorenzo asked in a collected voice, ignoring the fact that Sabrina just insulted me.\nAres shakes his head. \"The hybrid seems brutal. Maybe our men can kill him but how many men would we send before we kill him?\"\nLorenzo nods. \"We will do a rough calculation. Have you visited the people who were killed?\" He asked.\nAres shakes his head \"I tried. They are requesting for their Alpha\" he says drawing my attention.\nI nod absentmindedly. The door opens revealing a guard. He walks inside and drops a note on my table before leaving.\nA surge of anger rushed through me as I stared at the name who delivered the letter. It came from Finn.\nI opened it and began to read it \"It has come to my notice that you have a hybrid lurking around. Please endeavor to keep my mate safe or what happened with your mother will be the tip of an iceberg\" it read.\nAnger surged within me. Who did he think he was to threaten me with all the things in the world after my mother's death? When he knows he is fully responsible for it.\nDid he think that I was some weakling that he could just offend and get away with it?  He did not bother to negotiate, just started dashing out orders.\nNo. In fact, I refuse to let Lia go with him. I would rather kill him than let him take Lia. He made me motherless. I would make him Mateless. If it gets worse, I would make Luca convince her to reject him.\n\"Alpha what do you think? Should we send for Sabrina?\" Ares asked again.\nMy jaw clenched as I glared at him. What was his problem? \"I said no witches! This meeting is over!\" I shouted, stamping my hand on the table.\nEveryone flinched at my outburst. They stood up and bowed before leaving.\nImmediately they closed the door. Lorenzo began to shout, making an irritating noise in my ear. \"What was the meaning of that?\" he asked. Clearly angry.\nI sighed. In Times like this, I wished to be left alone. I threw the letter at him and he read it. Its face softened for a while.\n\"How would he bring your mother's death to the topic?\" He asked in an angry tone.\n\"I don't know. How can he be so immature?\"I asked, anger rolling out with my words.\n\"We have to call liars,\" he said.\nA few minutes later I walked in with a stony face. Seriously, does she always have to be frowning or have a stony face.\nIt would make her look more old than the way she is. I don't know what Luca sees in her or what my father saw in her that made him decide she would be my wife.\nShe took a seat beside me and crossed her chest. \"Why did you call me?\" she asked.\nI closed my eyes to call on patience. She did not even address me as her Alpha. In Times like this I wish she was not so important, getting rid of her would have been easier.\nHere I was trying to find a solution for us and she sat there playing away my time being unnecessarily rude.\n\"He is your Alpha!\" Lorenzo shouted at her. He obviously noted the fact that she did not bother greeting me or even bowing.\nMy cousin is seriously making this girl audacious.\n\"And he is my husband,\" she said as if we did not know about that.\nLorenzo took in a shaky breath \"You are meant to greet or at least bow\" he said in a calm voice. It was obvious that he was trying to control his temper.\nShe smiled, \"yeah, I will try and remember next time,\" she said. Meaning, I would not remember.\n\"I want you to go with Finn when he comes,\" I said.\nHer jaw dropped and I could feel Lorenzo's eyes burning into my skin. This was not what we had planned.\n\"What?. I am not going with him\" she said with a glaring face. She squirmed on her chair.\n\"You are going\" I ordered.\n\"I am not going,\" she replied, staring at me into my eyes. \n\"I am your husband\", I reminded her. She rolled her eyes like she seriously rolled her eyes. What audacity!\nShe scoffed \"That's a title. You do not order me,\" she said and tried to stand up\n\"You do not walk away from me lia!\" I shouted my voice echoing around the house. She flinched a bit.  A glint of fear passed through her eyes.\nShe leaned towards my side and pointed a hand at me. \"Last month I would have been scared. I would have done as you said because I felt you are a man you had what it took to be an Alpha but after the night when you tried to rape me. I now see you as a weakling and not my Alpha!\" She said her voice was cold as steel.\nSomething warm moved within my body. How did one night destroy her respect for me?\nShe made to walk away but I drew her back. \"Your godforsaken mate killed my mothers and even sent threats to me. You would go with him and kill his sister too. An eye for an eye. I am sending you as your husband and Alpha\" I ordered.\nA light chuckle left her mouth, and the door opened revealing Luca. He walked in, his jaw tightened seeing me with Lia.\n\"Never!\" She said and left.\nShe walked towards the door and stopped \"And lest I forget. I would be asking for a divorce\" she said",

Well, Lorenzo is quiet for the first time since I knew him. His mouth is slightly open, revealing his extent of surprise. Luca's eyes are wide in the face, and I think it is about to fall out of his eye socket.\nI burst into laughter. Dean narrows his eyes, and for some reason, the scene is very funny. I burst into laughter the second time, I laughed and laughed and laughed. I stopped to examine their faces and burst into laughter.\n\"Are you joking?\" Luca asks. His voice is soft, almost like a whisper. \nMy smile widened. Luca's voice is never soft. It's always rough even in his vulnerable moments.\n\"He asked you a question!\" The obnoxious twat called Lorenzo shouts. I roll my eyes. Seriously, why does he always have to be this annoying every time?\n\"Lia\" Dean growls. I smile. Last week he was trying to rape me and this week I am rendering him speechless.\nI stop smiling; the smile washes off my face in a second and is replaced with a blank, emotionless face.\n\"You heard me, Dean. I need a divorce. I am asking for a divorce. We are not even mates, so it's not going to affect you, \" I explain in a cold voice.\nI should also tell him that if he does not do as I say I would tell the whole park the way he treats me or maybe ask the moon goddess for a curse on him.\nMen like him are not meant to live. \"Who convinced you into this? Luca? You want to leave an Alpha for a rogue?\" He asks his tone laced with mockery.\nI am tempted to tell him that Luca is not just a rogue anymore that he is a hybrid but that would make Luca angry with me so instead I bit my tongue till it almost drew blood.\n\"Well, whomever I want to follow after leaving you is none of my business, and just so you know. If you took your time to examine Luca's face when I made the announcement. You would discover that he was as surprised as you are\".\nJust as I expected, Lorenzo opened his mouth to talk. Gosh! I don't even know how I hate Lorenzo more than Dean despite all he did to me.\nMaybe it is because Lorenzo is like a baby who is clinging to Dean for help and would do anything to remain in his good books.\n\"You do know that is not possible. He can banish you\" \nMy eyes darted to Luca's own. He swallows hard at the threat, his hands tighten around the door knob and for some reason, this is suddenly too attractive to look at. He is wearing a white long sleeve but I can still see his muscles inside.\nLorenzo bangs the table .\"Answer me, and, stop staring at your husband's cousin when he is here!\" He shouts his voice containing venom and anger.\nI roll my eyes as I reluctantly take my eyes off Luca and back to Dean.\n\"Lorenzo!\" Luca warns his voice is lethal with anger.\nLorenzo stands up and walks towards him \"What? What are you going to do? Kill me because I called her a whore? Or what. Huh, you are the one who convinced her to this nonsense idea you should at least stand up for her!\" He shouts as if he made any sense from what he just said.\nLuca releases him from the door, his hands fall to his waist,  and then he pinches the bridge of his nose. \"I did not conceive her into this and I don't even know what she is doing. I can't read her mind, but what I do know is that if you say another humiliating word against her, there will be a bloodbath here, and trust me, I will win. I might be a rogue but I will win\" he warns.\nLorenzo curls his hands into a fist and sits down. The whole time Dean's eyes have been on me.\n\"If I divorce you, who will you be with?\" He asks calmly, drumming his pen on his table.\nI shrug. \"Luca,\" I answered. The name flows out of my mouth in melody.\n\"Luca\" he repeats as he nods his head. His hands are still drumming on the table.\nHe moves his eyes from mine to Luca's own. \"Is this what you're doing?\" He asks.\nLuca shakes his head. \"No,\" he answers. His voice is low as if he is gaining cold feet about it.\nI sigh. He could say before everyone that he did not want me. Will I be heartbroken?. Yes. Will I be surprised? No. Why? Because all Attic men are hypocrites. \nI would just either tell Finn when he comes that I have a child for Dean or run away. Either way, I am escaping. I don't think I would be able to watch his betrayed face for a while.\nAs if Dean senses my insecurity, he asks, \"Do you want to? Do you want to marry her? Is she a sort of vengeance for Jenny? I thought my mother was enough?\" He asks, and for some reason, Dean's voice is filled with pain.\nA moment of silence passes, and then another passes; dread creeps into my skin. I closed my eyes for a while waiting for him to tell me no. To show me that, for once, I have done something stupid again.\n\"Answer me!\" Dean shouts.\n\"At first I did it as revenge to you for Jenny. Then I truly fell for her regardless of who she is to you. So she is not for vengeance,\" he says, leaving the part of marriage.\nTears flood my eyes as I suddenly realize my worth to him. He has indirectly said he loves me, but I am not someone to keep.\nDean opens his mouth to talk again but I open the door and leave.\n\"Lia! Lia!\" Luca calls but I am already running to my room.",

I have to get to my room on time without him following me. \nImmediately I get into my room I lock the door. I press my back against the cold door and gradually squat on the ground. Fresh tears flowed more than I thought it would.\nI curl my hand into a small fist as I hit the tilted floor. I have been a fool. A big one to think that a hybrid would ever make me his wife.\nIf I am being truthful I don't even know what I asked for a divorce. Maybe I was tired of being a side piece. Tired of being Dean's wife and Luca's side Chick. I wanted to be someone's whole option.\nWhere they would pick me against anything. I curse under my breath. \"Fuck!\"I shouted.\nWhat the hell was wrong with my thinking? \n\"Lia open the fucking door!\" Luca shouts, hitting the door. His voice seems like a voice that is filled with pain but Luca can't be pained. He would be jubilating, he just passed a bullet.\n\"Go away, Luca. Go away!\" I scream at him. What does he want to tell me? I love you but I can't wed you. You are my cousin's wife but I would love to keep you because your pussy fits into me and swallows my cock like it is made for me.\nOr maybe he would issue a live note like most of the boys only that his love confession would be filled without emotions.\n\"No lie. I am not going until I talk to you!\" He shouts back, hitting the door the more. The vibration sends warmth to my body, not my heart.\nJust this morning, he had fucked me my pant is still in his room. Maybe he has thrown them away.\nA rush of guilt mixed with shame rushed through me. I would have just stayed with Dean as his wife. Even though I do not love him, at least I have a child for him. I am meant to be securing Merlin's place in the palace; instead, I feel like a heartless rogue.\nI rush to my phone and dial Dean's number while I have the chance to do so.\n\"Lia I am about to break this door so if you are there either you leave or you open the door. I would not want you to get hurt!\" He shouts.\nHurt indeed. He has already shattered my heart beyond repair. What else does he want, or maybe he does not understand the meaning of hurt.?\nBang! Bang! I can feel his full weight against the door as he tries to break in. I look at Dean's number with shaky hands. It is ringing.\nI close my eyes as I say a one-minute prayer. Please moon goddess. Let him pick before Luca enters. Before he convinced him against me and my child.\n\"What do you want, lia?\" he asks as he picks up the call, and the door falls open. Luca walks inside.\nFor some reason, I grow cold feet about what I am about to do. How would Luca feel? Then I remembered what he said. There is no way he is going to feel bad.\n\"Lia, I am a very busy person. What do you want?\" He is lacking impatience.\nLuca furrows his eyebrow, confusion laced over his face as he mouths, \"What are you doing? \" to me.\n\" I am sorry-\" I begin, but Luca snatches the phone for me, smashing it on the wall. O  as I watch my phone on the floor with a broken screen. I don't even think I can repair that screen \n\"What were you about to do?\" He asked me. His voice was laced with anger and disbelief.\nI cross my hands around my chest. \"What do you want?\" I ask.\nI bend my head to avoid me from staring at him. I seem to be filled with desire anytime I do so, especially with the fact that he is currently sweaty.\n\"Lia, I am asking you a question! What were you about to do? Tell Dean that you are sorry and what?\" He shouts at me, his voice echoed around the room.\nAnger well up within me. He lost the right to shout at me when he did what he did just now.\n\"Yes! I wanted to tell him that I was sorry and that I would not want to divorce him. At least with all I have done, he has never asked me to divorce him. He tolerates the fact that I am having an affair with his cousin, and he is my child's father, which you are not and would never be!\" I shout back at him. Frustration is breeding in my veins.\nA glint of anger passed through his eyes \"Really?\" He asks his voice low with pain. \"I might not be his father but I have sacrificed my life for him. Do you think Dean is going to accept you with his child? He does not even recall that night of you guys together. And do you know why he would never value you or even treat you right?\" He asks me, his face a few meters away from mine as he stares into my soul.\n\"You don't know what you want. He is the father of your child today, and by tomorrow, he is not. He is a twat today but you want him on your bed tomorrow. You want a divorce today, you don't want a divorce at the moment. You loved me yesterday, you don't love me today.\" \n\"I loved you! I loved you. That was why I asked for a divorce. That was why I shamelessly offered myself to you, but each time I do that, you remind me that I am just a piece of trash.

I would have said yes. Of course, I want to spend my life with you, travel with you around the whole wolf lands, take you on your fancy date, and share your annoying room with you.

We were like an actual couple but Dean could banish her from the park. If Dean banishes her, she would have to take Merlin with her, and Dean would finally know that she had a child with him.\nHe might ask for the custody of the child or might kill him. As illegitimate heirs are not allowed and this would break both me and him.\nI knew I was kind of wrong by being quiet when Dean asked me if I wanted to marry her or when I finished  my love confession leaving the part out if me willing to marry her\nBut in my defense, the question came suddenly. The fact that they thought I convinced her added more shock to me but I am happy that she wants me.\nI was happy that she was finally craving me as much as I did. So imagine my surprise when she left the room with tear-filled eyes. I followed her out of pure instinct only to find out that she was on a phone call with Dean, trying to tell him she was sorry.\nSorry for what? Sorry for wanting me as much as I wanted her. Sorry for asking for a divorce from someone who has never treated her right. Anger filled up in my veins when she said she was trying to do it for Merlin.\nA needle of pain stabbed me when she said that she would rather be with Dean because he is his father. Like seriously? How would she ask to say such a thing?\nI loved her. I always did. I have taken everything that belonged to her as mine, including Merlin who by the way would end up reminding me of the same Dean she asked me to kill the other day.\nI am not saying that she should be selfish; what I am saying is that she should love me and choose me as her first, not her second or last.\n\"I should not lose faith in you? You don't want to be with me? You want me to be your dirty little secret for only you to know and no one else. You don't want to be seen with me in public, you deny all my requests for a date or a Cinema, and when I ask you for a date to the museum, you are not even delighted. You just agreed, maybe because you are bored, or you were angry and wanted me to leave you alone, \"she said, tears streaming down her eyes, making her blue eyes darker.\nMy chest is filled with pain at the thought of visiting the museum with her. At the thought of having all those memories replay in my head.\nI heaved a sigh as I pinched the bridge of my nose and explained calmly, \" I am not the type who goes on dates, lia. It is not as if I don't want to be seen with you. I do. I would want the whole world to know you are mine if you wish. And although all this sounds foreign to me, I would go because it is you. After all, every moment I spend with you is worth more than anything, and I was not reluctant with the Museum date. I would go with you. It just reminded me of something I wanted to forget. But I love you, Lia, I do. And it would pain me if you decide to leave me for Dean because of some quarrel or because of Merlin. You asked me to kill him; I will for your sake, I will, but please don't leave me,\" I pleaded with her. Her eyes softened for a while as she stared at me with disbelief.\nI can't imagine I am the one being this vulnerable. I am never vulnerable but here I am doing just that.\nI lean forward and cup her face as I press my forehead against her own \"Please, don't leave, me\" I whisper in a soft voice.\nI don't think I would be able to survive if she left me again. Or chose Dean over me.\nWe stayed in that moment for a while before she gradually warped her hands around me. \"I am not going to leave you, Luca,\" she says in a soft, reassuring voice.\nMy heart melted at the assurance. \"I won't leave you\" she adds. She removed her head from mine and looked me in the eye.\nHer eyes scan my face and land on my lips. I swallow hard as emotions flow through me. An overwhelming urge to kiss her feels my body.\nBefore I can remove my mouth from her she kisses me. Her soft lips pressed against my mouth, and I smiled; I bit her lip a little, and a moan escaped her lips. She opens her mouth for me as I gain access to her lips. We kissed each other for a while, unlike my other kisses which are rough and filled with lust. This one is gentle and filled with love.\nWe break from each other, panting. A smile tugged on her lips. \"That means you are going to go to the museum with me,\" she says.\nI nod my head in acceptance. I would rather spend time with her than allow my memories to snatch her from me.\nHer smile widened, and for some reason, that sent warmth to my heart. I smile at her back. She places a soft kiss on my lips.\n\"I made a reservation for two,\" she tells me as she walks away.\nI grab her wrist, drawing her back to me; this time, my grin is wider. \"I would do that in one account,\" I say.\nShe furrowed her eyebrows. \"And what is that, my love?\" She asked.\n\"When we come back, you will reward me with sex.\"\nA chuckle escaped her lips. \"No way,\" she answered, still laughing.\nI glare at her. \"Okay, okay. I would reward you with a lot of sex,\" she replied.\n\"Good,\" I say as I let her go. She runs toward the bathroom door and stops \"Get dressed and make sure you are putting on a suit\" she says.\nI burst into laughter. I am always in a trouser or sweatpants, but I now need to arrange a suit for this date. Maybe we will visit a restaurant or cinema afterward.",

        "content": "Luca POV\nI look at my reflection and I can't help it as a chuckle escapes me. I am wearing a three-piece suit, and a diamond wristwatch and all I can think about is how Lia has reduced me to this.\nDon't get me wrong, I usually wear shirts and trousers but it is only for meetings even when I have decided to ask a girl out on a date. I had never worn a suit or put on my favorite perfume to impress her. Everybody knows who I am and every girl would kill to have me on her bed.\nBut here I am trying to look as perfect as I can for Lia. This is the first time I am going on an actual date with someone.\nA knock on the door interrupts my thoughts, my muscles tighten, and I take one last look at myself. Hope she would be okay with my dressing.\n\"Come in,\" I say and the door opens slowly revealing a breathtaking lie. She is putting on a sky-blue satin gown with matching shoes. Her hair is packed high in a bun decorated with some hair pieces. My eyes travel around her body before it lands on her perfect oval face. \nMy breath seize for a bit, I am normally used to Lia's beauty. She is just simply beautiful. It is as if God created time to create her but with the addition of the makeup on her face and the red lip gloss on her lip.. damn. She looks breathtaking.\nShe clears her throat, drawing me to my present. \"You look handsome Luca\" she complements me with a smile.\nPride gushes over me at her compliment. I find myself really happy that I can meet her expectations.\nI clear my throat as I compliment her \"You. You look breathtaking Lia. So beautiful\" A pink hue covers her face at my complement and my groin twitches in reaction.\nWhat the fuck. How can her blushing affect me this much? I smile and stretch forth my hands. \"Let's go,\" I say.\nImmediately we are outside, I return to my usually masked face. All the guards bow at us as we pass. I am pretty sure they are going to gossip about us immediately when they get to their private room.\nThey might see me as a home wrecker or even call me one, but to hell with their opinion. The one way I would lose control is if I hear someone call her a whore or a loose girl. That would be the death of the person.\nImmediately we got to where my car was.. I open the door for her to enter and close it behind her. I turn around and get into the car.\nImmediately I entered the car, and she handed over our ticket to me with a smile. \"You do know that frowning on your date is seen as bad manners. Especially for the men,\" she says her voice laced with amusement.\nA silly smile shadows my face as I turn on the car. \"You could just ask me to give you a smile and I would\"\nShe nods and studies my face for a while, with her eyes all over me I find it hard to control myself. \"I know, Luca. But I want it to come naturally. You are always guarded. You really smile and-\nBut I cite her off. \"I always smirk at Lia. Especially after I have made you come,\" I say and move my hands in between her gown. Thank god she is wearing a short gown.\nA hiss escapes her as she tries to control herself \"Luca I am serious, smile often\" she commands with a stern voice.\nA smile appears on my face when I hit her g-spot and a loud moan escapes her mouth, filling my car with her rhythmic voice \"I am smiling lia\" I say and thrust in deeper.\nShe tightens her grip on her dress as I thrust in deeper and faster. \"Please,\" she moans. \"Luca, please,\" she pleads.\nI slow my pace down and remove my hands from her pants. I shove it into my mouth and lick every bit of her juice. I am seriously tempted to shove to the back of the car and fuck her.\n\"Luca, please,\" she begs, her voice filled with desperation. Desperate to feel my hands on her pussy.\n\"Please what,\" I ask and creep my way back to her pants and tease her clit.\n\"Please let me cum,\" she begs. \nWith that, I thrust my hands into her pants and started increasing my pace. Satisfaction burns in me as she moans my name. A few minutes later she cums in my hand. I watch her for a while as her breathing is steady.\nI stop our car at the museum. \"we are here,\" I announce.\n\"Where?\" she asks as she scans our environment. Her eyes widened with realization. \"We are at the museum,\" she says.\nI nod with a smile. \"You were fucking me while driving?. What if we had an accident?\" She asks anxiety mixed with anger dances around her face.\n\"That would never happen, princess. Besides, I use my fingers, not my cock, and be rest assured my driving skills are the best,\" I assure her.\nShe scans my face for a while before leaning forward to place a kiss on my lips. Surprise fills my face, and my heart dances with excitement. I tighten my grip on her hair before she can stop me. I deepen the kiss and a moan escapes my lips.\n\"Fuck Lia,\" I say and stop before I lose control. I stare at her swollen lips as desire rushes through me.\nShe moves her hands to my trousers. My eyes widen. \"What are you doing?\" I ask, my voice laced with hesitation.\nA smirk appears on her face \"You've got a boner\" she says. I look at the time and at her. \nI grip her hand. \"That would be later,\" I say. She would stare at me with disbelief. \"You can't be serious,\" she says.\nI nod \"I am serious,\" I say and open the door.  She walks toward me and takes.  my arms with a frown.\n\"I never knew you were so bent on satisfying my sexual needs,\" I say as we stroll towards the museum.\nPeople walk past us. Some pass without recognizing us and others shoot us with a surprised look.\n\"And I never mistook you for someone who would reject sex or blow job,\" she replied her voice still masked with feigned anger.\nI burst into laughter as I stroll inside. Contentment fills my face.\nShe takes my card from me and gives it to a woman. \"Luca, another one,\" she says with a knowing smile.\nMy muscles tightened as I recognized her face. She was here when I brought Jenny and she knew everything about her death.\nPainful memories rush within me and I've got a bad feeling that this might not end well.",

        "content": "Luca POV\n\"Celeste,\" I say and she gives me a knowing smile. She seems to have captivated Lia or maybe she is usually smitten by old people.\n\"Isn't she our Luna?\" she asks.\nI glare at her, and she returns it with a smile. She was there when I swore to Dean that I would take everything that gave him happiness and I guess she is mistaking my vow on the date, but it is far from that. I want to spend time with Lia and make her more happy.\n\"Yes,\" I nod. Daring her to speak one more word. But she presses her lips into a tight line. \n\"I see\" She nods and shows us inside. By the time we enter, the place is almost empty. \nMy eyes scan the place immediately. Wow! The place has changed since I last visited here. I hate visiting this place because it reminds me of Jenny, my mate. I met her here; she broke my trust here, and I was here reminiscing our memory when I got the call that my cousin and my best friend who was Lorenzo killed her.\nAlthough Lorenzo did not kill her, he played a role in her death. Lia let go of my hand and rushed towards a solar eclipse painting hanging on the wall.\nShe turns to me, her eyes lit with excitement. \"Luca, come and see this photo,\" she calls out.\nI shove my hand into my pocket shake whatever memory I had about Jenny and walk towards Lia. Lia is the future and she will always be the future.\nHer hand caresses the photos with a smile. Just the same way Jenny always caressed hers. \"It's so beautiful,\" she said, her voice filled with awe. I have never understood what girls love about painting. It was boring. I preferred the sculpture to the painting because it felt realistic, not abstract. Perhaps that was why I enjoyed sculpting to painting. It assures me that it is always there and not a fallacy to me.\n\"Beautiful right?\" An icy voice asks from behind me. I flinch to see Celeste standing beside me. Lia's attention is still focused on the painting.\nI groan in frustration as I try to hide the annoyance that is going up within me. \"What are you doing here? I whisper to her, making sure not to distract Lia, whose entire attention is focused on the paintings, \"What are you doing here?\"\"\n\"Annoying, don't you think? It seems the moon goddess has a way of punishing you. All your mates have a thing for painting. She is not even bothered about seeing the sculpture. They are so different for you and I would tell from experience. People who have different desires and love different things never end up together,\" she says.\nI shoot her a burning glare. This old woman always pisses me off. I take a step to meet her, but she grabs me by my arms, drawing me back to my former position.\n\"You have a brother\", she says.,\"\nMy eyes widen and it says,\" On her face.\" A what?\" I ask with disbelief.\n\"A hybrid brother,\" she says. My eyes threatened to fall from my eye socket. I furrow my eyebrows. The air seems too thick to breathe, says in for a while.\nShe taps my shoulders. \"Witches know everything. We are on your side,\" she says and walks away. I stared at her, so she was a witch. No wonder she always behaved like a creep.\n\"Luca!\" Lia calls me, bringing my attention back to her. She has a small sculpture in her hands. Her face brightens with a smile.\n\"Look what I found. It's an incredible sculpture, it brightens,\" she says, caressing it. I listen to her explanation with rapt attention.\nShould I tell her I am the one who did it? No. She would ask me so many questions and I really do not have any answer to them. So I just let her explain.\nShe snaps her finger before my eyes, making me blink. \"you haven't been listening to me. Have you?\" She asks.\nI nod. \"Of course, lia. You have been analyzing the whole sculpture,\" I said my voice laced with amusement.\nI never knew you had a thing for sculptures\"\n\"I do. I have a thing for art although I prefer drawing. It's a gift passed by my mother. That is the only thing I took from her.\" she says, her voice sounding distant.\nMy heart tightens with pain. We both shared equal losses. We both lost our mother. The only difference was that I grew up to know my father. She never did.\n\"Wow, I never knew you could draw perhaps you could draw me too. While I am naked,\" I whispered into her ear as I encircled my arms around her waist.\nShe looks at me in disbelief. \"Luca! We are in the museum!\"\n\"I never said you should draw me here. Maybe when we get to the palace. In fact,\" no sex till you draw me\" \nA light chuckle escapes from her lips as she says, \"You are going to be sex starved if you embark on a no painting, no sex policy,\" and leans into my chest.\n\"Why? Am I not sexy enough?\" I ask.\nShe bends her head to her finger, a thing I notice she does when she is nervous. \"I don't like drawing that much. I don't think I am good enough,\" she says and walks out of my arms.\nShe moves inside to the place where they keep delicate sculptures. My breath seizes as I stare at the beautiful sculptures. \nI give into my desire and take one of them, caressing them. I wonder if I would still come alive if I started sculpting again.\n\"I enrolled for a class. You know, a drawing class, but all I could think about was my mum. She would have thought of me if she were alive. To make it worse, the teacher told me she knew my mother, \" she said, her voice filled with pain.\n\"I stopped drawing but I would give it a try when we get home,\" a smile caresses my lips at the idea.",

        "content": "Lia pov.\nEver since I mentioned the museum date, Luca had been behaving strangely. Seemed distant, always lost in his own thoughts. It's as if the museum brings back memories he wants to keep behind. Memories that are hurting him. \nSeeing him this empty and distant leaves me with an overwhelming desire to crawl underneath his skin find out what is wrong and take it away. At first, I thought it was because he did not want me or maybe he was scared of being seen with me but right now, it seemed I have never been the problem.\nWhen I notice it I try asking him about it but he cleverly dodges the question by giving me a mind-blowing orgasm in the car. The fact that he let me fill his car with my moan while he drove, drives me insane and for some goddamn reason, I find it incredibly attractive.\nThen we got to the museum, and he immediately became tensed. Though he tried to hide it, I could feel it through his sweaty palm and his tightened muscles, although I refused to ask him. Is not as if I ask him he would answer me.\n\"Luca!\" I call out when I discover that he has zoned out again.\nHe flinched a little as his attention fell back on me. His forehead is sweaty and his blue eyes are darker, like a troubled sea. \nI walk up to him, closing the distance between us. His eyes fall down to my face and it softens for a while. \"You have not been listening to me. If you are not happy about the date, we could leave,\" I say, my voice soft with worry.\nHe tilts his head from my eyes. \"Lia, I'm fine,\" he says. but I know he is lying. His voice sounds deep with rumble.\n\"No Luca, you are not fine. You have not been listening to any word I said\"\n\"I have been listening. You said you would draw me when you get back. You would use me as your muse to begin drawing again,\" he says with a soft smile.\nHis smile reaches mine. Although he got it wrong, I can't help but smile at the importance he attaches to me being his muse, nevertheless, he is hiding something. I can tell.\n\"Am I right?\" He asks with a smile that brightens his eyes.\nI shake my head \"No, I was telling you that I would only draw if you sculpture,\" I said.\nThe light in his eyes dims, and he removes his eyes from mine as his face dampens \"I am not a sculptor\" he lies.\nLike Luca is actually lying to my face right now. \"That's a lie, Luca. You are a sculptor. I know you are a sculptor. I have seen the hidden sculptures you hide and the unfinished ones. I don't know the reason you stopped, but I believe that you can start again. That was why I brought you to the museum, so you can regain your passion,\" I explained.\nHis eyes widen for a while before it returns to normalcy. \"It's not that easy, lia. You don't just gain a passion for something because I visited the museum,\" he replied.\nI nod. I knew what he was saying was true, but I still wanted him to gain a little inspiration from the museum. Maybe seeing what he loved will help him.\nA smile cracked his lips as he drew me to himself. \" You can be my inspiration, you know?\" He whispered against my ear in a teasing tone.\nI lean against his comforting abyss even though I know he is trying to avoid the question with a joke.\n\"How?\" I ask, returning his teasing tone with a smile.\n\"By this,\" he says as he uses his hand to caress my neck down to my breast. He grabs it for a while. Excitement rushes towards me and my nipples stand piercing my gown.\nI close my eyes for a moment even though we could get caught. A moan escapes my lips. Excitement when he pinches my nipple, sending delicious pain around my body. I clench my thigh to avoid the throbbing reaction in between my legs.\n\"Luca, we are in the museum,\" I whispered, trying hard to control myself.\nHe nods. His lips find their way to my neck and he bites it a little. He cups my boobs in his hands \"Look around\" he orders.\nI immediately turn around. There are still a few people around, but not that much. \"There are people around,\" I whispered back.\nHe nods. \"Come with me,\" he orders as he drags me to a room. He locks the door immediately behind him.\nImmediately, he grips my hair and drives me into a passionate kiss. I murmur amidst it \"We could be caught, Luca\" \nHe remains silent for a while. He lifts my short gown and runs his hands over my wet pants. His eyes darken with desire. \"More reason we need to be fast,\" he says and shoves his hands into my hole.\nA moan escapes me, I grip his hair as he increases his pace. He places a soft kiss on my lips.\n\"Please,\" I moan \"Luca please\"\n\"Please what?\" He asks against my earlobe.\n\"Please fuck me. I need you inside me,\" I plead.\nA smile crooked his lips \"I thought you were worried about us getting caught?\" He asks.\nI nodded as I bit my lips to stifle my moan. I am about to come. Just when I am about to come, he removes his hands. My eyes widened. Don't tell me he is about to leave me unsatisfied.\nHe unbuckles and removes his trouser as he brings out his dick, which is already erect. He grabs me closer to himself as he thrusts himself into me.\nA scream escapes my lips as he covers my lips to prevent my moan from coming out.\nHe groans immediately as he has entered fully. \"Fuck lia. He groans immediately upon fully entering and says, \"Your hole was made just for me,\" before starting to thrust deeper.\nThe room temperature increased. Thank God this place is quiet. The probability of getting caught having sex increases my excitement driving me to pleasure.\n\"Fuck!\" he groans as he comes. Our breathing reduces back to normal. He stays there for a while, leaning against me, his dick still in my Virgina.\nAfter some minutes, he removes his dick and tucks in. He cleans my thigh with his handkerchief before pressing a kiss on my forehead.\n\"Let's go,\" he says with a smile. We walk out looking innocent. The ride back home is silent, just filled with him stealing glances at me and smiling.\nImmediately, we step outside. I immediately feel something is wrong. The atmosphere feels tight and heavy.\nAs we stepped into the hall, I froze. Finn is standing in the middle with Dean and Lorenzo by his side.\nHe grins at me, and Luca tightens his grip around my waist. \"hello love\"",

        "content": "Lia pov\nMy jaw dropped immediately as I entered the palace and saw Finn standing in front of Dean and Lorenzo, who had a frown on their faces. Luca immediately tightened his grip on my waist. What was he doing here? He said he would give me three days, so why the hell was he here? For days, I haven't even gotten the chance to see Merlin or Lexie. I was not even ready to leave Luca. Is not as if I was going to follow him, anyway. The mate bond was there. I felt the pull. It was nothing to compare to what I shared with Luca. My clothes still had his musky scent around me.\n\"What are you doing here?\" I asked in an evenly calm voice. Trying to hide whatever anger was welling up within me.\nHe strolled towards me, his bodyguard at his back. All armed with daggers and guns. He was wearing a three-piece black suit and a black shoe. He would normally look attractive to others, but not to me. The only attractive wolf I knew was Luca, and I intend to keep it that way.\nHe reached out to caress my face, but Luca pushed me behind him. Making him stand in front of him. I could see Luca's tensed shoulder. He was tense, I could see it. We had discussed this several times, and I had promised him that I would stay with him, and even with my promise, he was still scared. Scared of losing me and so was I.\nFinn's face changed to a frown immediately as he dropped his hands to his side. He inhaled and exhaled, trying to maintain his self-control.\nHe cleared his throat. \"Lia, I came to take you. Let's go home,\" he said with a warning voice.\n\"The only home she knows is here and not your pack. Alpha Finn,\" Luca replied with great disdain in his voice.\nA smile crept onto Finn's lip. \"She is my mate, Luca, and your cousin's wife. Have you no shame?\" He asked in a teasing voice.\nI could feel the anger evaporating out of Luca's body. He was clearly trying to control himself from doing something drastic and revealing his identity.\n\"That is a business, not yours,\" he said.\nHe tried to take me, but I hugged Luca from behind. Trying to make sure I was safe.\nWhen he discovered that I was not moving an inch from Luca's body. He decided to tease the version of Luca that he knew \"I wonder why your brother has not killed you. You are a useless tyrannic rogue. Let go of her now or I will kill you before all of them,\" he warned.\nMy eyes moved to Dean. He had a smile on his face as he watched the argument between them. Lorenzo was by his side. He whispered something into his ear, but I read his mouth \"Just as we planned\" he said.\nWhat could they have planned? Were they the ones that sent Finn here?\n\"First, Dean Is not and would not be my brother. And secondly, I am not letting go,\" he growled.\nDean and Lorenzo nodded with amusement. Finn approached Luca with the white stake. Then it dawned on me. They wanted to make sure Luca got Finn angry and then killed him. It would be that Luca challenged an Alpha and not the other way around.\nI let go of Luca's body and stepped in front of Luca. \"Lia, what are you doing?\" Luca asked in a pleading tone. Like he was saying, saying, please don't leave me again.\n\"I lia Pierce, Luna of the Attics pack rejects you, Alpha Finn of the Bloodhound pack,\" I said and added \"Leave the palace immediately,\" rejecting orders.\nA glint of pain passed through Finn's eyes. He dropped his gaze to my eyes, staring at me with his intense blue eyes. My heartbeat increased, and my knee got weaker. He was trying to use the mate bond to manipulate me.\n\"I Alpha Finn of the bloodhound pack reject your rejection,\" he said calmly and added \"You are my mate lia! I waited for weeks to have you! You said you would come with me! Not the other way round! You and I know that mate bond is stronger than the flung you have for him! He is a fucking rogue!\" He shouted, making me flinch.\nI wanted to tell him to get out, wanted to reprimand him for calling Luca a rogue and for calling whatever we had a fling!\n\"Do you think if he had his mate, you would be important to him?\" He asked.\nI swallowed hard. Would Luca sacrifice his mate for me? Whatever. It's been seven years since Dean killed his mate, but he still hates Dean for years. As if on cue, Luca wrapped his arms around my waist, soothing me.\n\"We love each other and I would not leave him\"\nFinn chuckled. \"Well, I have also come to love you, Lia. To crave your cinnamon hair scent. To watch over you. To count the freckles on your face and everything. You have made me obsessed with you. I would be damned if I let him have you,\" he confessed. My heart weakens a little with his confession. I was not even sure that Luca knew my hair scent.\n\"I am not letting her go,\" Luca said in an oddly calm voice.\nFinn shook his head. \"how about we renegotiate,\" he said. \"A mate for a mate,\" he said.\n\"What?\" Luca said. Dean and Lorenzo gave him a questioning look.\nJust then, a lady walked in from behind, the sound of her high heels echoing around the room. She stood beside Finn and Luca immediately left me. Like he actually stepped back.\nShe had blonde long hair, and brown eyes with a one-sided dimple. She wore a white gown.\nHer gaze hovered around me, and she stretched forth her hand \"You must be Lia. The one everyone wants,\" she said.\n\"Well, I am Jenny. The one everyone needs\" she said.",

How come she was alive, and,\" no one knew?\nI glared at Finn, who returned it with an intense smile. Was this all a game to him? A game to separate me from Luca?  Well, he was a fool if it was ever going to happen.\n\"Jenny?\" Luca called in a soft pleading voice. I never thought his voice could be this soft for someone like him.\n\"Luca, soft,\" she answered and walked up to him, pushing me aside. I staggered, but Finn grabbed my waist, helping me gain balance.\nLuca's eyes softened immediately. He has never looked at me this way. His gaze roamed around her face. He raised his hands to caress her face but held it mid-way. His eyes bore fear. What would happen if she was not real? It was as if he was praying for her to be real.\nHe finally touched her face, letting his finger roam around her face before he cupped her cheek. Jenny leaned into his touch and his expression softened the more. He has never been this loose around me.\n\"They. They said you were dead. I.. and thought you were dead\" he said. His voice broke, he was almost at the point of crying.\n\"I am alive, \" Luca said. I had to hide,\" she said. Her voice was sensually soft. Not like mine which was high-pitched and sounded like a faulty piano when working.\nHe drew her into his arms for a hug. His arms wrapped around her tightly, as if he wanted to cling to her for life.\nAnger welled up within me. I have been trying to get him to let me in and he never did, but here was Jenny who disappeared for years. He was letting her back.\nI bit my mouth as it threatened to flow blood. This was someone who had said nothing could come between us. Someone who deceived me into rejecting my mate.\nI have been fooled once more by a man. What I previously said was the truth. He only kept me for sex and nothing more. I even had to persuade him to go on a date and he still ended up fucking me.\n\"Daina,\" I called one maid. She rushed towards me and bowed her head before me. \n\"Get my bags ready. Pack all my things. I am leaving with my mate,\" I ordered.\nImmediately, I said those words. Luca left Jenny and went to me. \"What do you think you are doing?\", he asked.\n\"Going with my mate as I should have done, \"I said and walked past him. He immediately followed me to my room.\n\"Lia, let's talk about this,\" he begged, as he locked the door behind me.\nI ignored him as I joined Daina to arrange my clothes.\n\"Daina, leave,\" he orders. She dropped her clothes and bowed.\n\"If you step out of this place. I would make sure Dean punishes you severely. It would be my last wish for him,\" told her.\nShe immediately stopped. \"Seriously Lia\"? He asked. Anger is written all over his face. It was obvious that he was not used to being opposed.\n\"Leave now!\" He barked.\nShe stood looking at me with imploring eyes. I would not let him punish her for my decision. I nodded my head, and she left.\nImmediately, he locked the door behind him. He walked toward my bed and threw my arranged clothes on the bed. \n\"You can't leave lia. You can't leave me behind\" he begged.\nI scoffed behind, \",\" scoffed. Oh, please. Are you not tired of pretending? Let me leave so that you can go back to your mate,\" I said in a pained voice.\n\"Look lia, is not what you are thinking. I was just seeing her after a long while. That was why I hugged her. It is you I want. It is you I love!\" He proclaimed. His voice filled with pleading pain.\nI shook my head. Why does everyone think I am a fool? That I am easily convinced. \"I saw the way you looked at her. Luca. You have never and will never look at me that way!\"\n\"I can't look at you that way! Whatever you are seeing is not real. I have never shared a bond with anyone. Yes, she is my mate, but she is not the love of my life and she would never be. Do you know I was content with having a threesome with her, but I could not even bear the thought of sharing you with anyone? When I first came. I knew you were Dean's wife, but I could not stop myself from wanting you. I decided to go against my morale and have you. I can't live without you,\" he pleaded.\nA sigh escaped my lips. His confession softened whatever anger was within me, but I could not. \"I am leaving with Finn. You will stay with Jenny for a while and when you are sure you will know where to find me but with what I just saw. I can't stay here and besides, she has come to stay. I need to go,\" I said. \"Luca, please. Let me go,\" I pleaded. If he said one more word, I was going to melt away.\nHis eyes softened with pain, and his neatly combed hair was already rough. He was still wearing the suit we used for the date. How come we were separated on our date?\nHe walked towards me and cupped my cheek. \"Here is what I will propose. You can stay with him but I will come for you lia. I would kill him and my mate for you. Burn the pack and reveal who I am. Consequence be damned,\" he said.\nI nodded \"Okay,\" I said. He raised my head to meet his and kissed me. Claimed me, marked me. The kiss was rough with pain and desire.\n\"I will miss you,\" he said amidst the kiss, then he broke it. Leaving me for more. See you soon. He said and walked out, leaving me wanting more, carving for more.",

        "content": "Lia pov\nI called Daina and watched as she arranged my clothes for my departure. I haven't seen Dean ever since Finn came. Guess he never cared for me.\nA knock on the door interrupted my packing session. \"Come in,\" I said.\nThe door opened, revealing Lorenzo. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes and ask him out. What had he come here to do? To ask me out of the palace, if that was the case I already knew because Finn was waiting for me outside, or maybe he had come to rub it on my face and call me a whore.\nI focused on zipping my luggage while the silence existed. \"If you are here to watch me leave, I would advise that you go because it is not going to help. I might as well snatch your head since I am leaving\"\nHe sighed a little and took a quick glance at my room. His eyes filled with something like pain or regret before it landed on mine again.\n\"You could stay, you know. We could fight him. After all, you have already rejected him.\" He said.\nMy eyes widened. Is this the same Lorenzo I had always known or is my mind playing mind games with me? What changed? I thought he hated me.\n\"If you can't stay with us. Stay for Luca. He needs you,\" He said in a pleading tone.\nI scoffed. \"He has a mate. I have a mate. I see no reason he should be missing me when he has someone warming his bed,\" I said as I took my frame from the wall.\nHe heaved a sigh \"Lia, you know that there is some bond that is stronger than mate bond.\" He said.\nA chuckle escaped my lips as I turned my attention towards him again. \"What do you gain from my stay?\" I asked.\nHe shook his head. \"Luca was my friend before all this incident. I have never actually seen him this broken,\" he informed me. \n\"He is acting strong but we all know the bond between them is over,\" he said.\nPain clutched my heart at the reminder of Luca's pained expression even after he kissed me, but he will get over it and move on. After all, he had always kept some part of himself for her.\n\"He will be fine, Lorenzo. You should be happy that you are finally getting rid of the whore,\" I said, giving him a sad smile.\nHe smiled back and gave me a weak smile. \"I just feel your going would bring doom, but goodbye,\" he said and left.\nDaina carried my luggage. I took one last look at the room before leaving. I wonder if Jenny would be the one to take over the room after I am gone. Maybe Luca would make love to her instead of fucking me.\nDean, Lorenzo, and everyone stood around the hall, watching me as I rolled my luggage. I scanned the room for Luca, but he was nowhere to be found.\nFresh paint paved my heart. Was he so anxious to go that he could not wait for me to leave before going to her? \nDean walked towards me and hugged me before whispering into my ear, \"He said I should tell you goodbye. He hopes you guys come back once again. And for The first time I am in support of you Guy's reunion,\" he said with a little chuckle.\nHe pulled me out of the hug and gave me a kiss on my head before walking away. Maid putting on the Finn park uniform,\" came to carry my bag, but Daina held it tight to herself.\n\"I would follow you,\" she said firmly. Her voice was laced with pleading and loyalty.\n\"Daina-\" I began, but she cut me off.\n\"Please, my Luna. Please,\" she pleaded.\nI nodded. Since she actually wanted to follow me, besides, I needed someone by my side. Besides, I was going to start a new life elsewhere, and I knew no one.\nMy heart dropped elsewhere because of all this preparation. Merlin had not crossed my mind. Would Finn be okay with him coming? No. He would never want him, and Merlin's presence would cause a problem in the pack.\nBecause he was Dean's problem child. I would beg Benedicta to stay with him till everyone was settled, but I needed to stop at her place before leaving.\n\"Lia,\" Finn called. He was standing behind me. I turned to him. \"Let's go,\" he said, stretching forth his hands.\nI turned to look at Dean and Lorenzo once more. They nodded their heads at me but I did not need their approval. I wanted to see Luca once more.\nAs if on cue, Luca came outside with Jenny. Our eyes locked for a while. I wanted to hug him, wanted to tell him that we could fight for ourselves. His eyes looked pained, and his blue eyes looked watery.\n\"I would look after him, myself,\" he said, staring at me. I smile a genuine smile for the first time. He smiled back and nodded at me. Signaling me to go.\nGosh! I never knew I would miss this place. I hadn't even stayed here for two years but I had already gotten used to the place. I got addicted to Luca.\nI turned towards Finn, who gave me a smile and took my hand. It surprised me that he was so patient with me after all this while.\nThe guards escorted us with Daina by my side. I entered the car and Finn entered through the other way.\nImmediately we entered, his smile vanished as he looked at me. \"We are going to my pack, Lia. You would have to leave everything about Luca behind. You are going to be my wife and Luna, and I really don't love sharing. It would be good for us if you leave everything behind,\" he warned coldly.\nI nodded. \"I would like to see a friend,\" I informed him",

        "content": "Lia pov\nThe ride towards Finn Pack is enveloped in heavy silence. Just the sound of our breathing and the car engine sound. He would occasionally steal a glance at me and then go back to his iPad.\nHow did I get here? I was meant to go back with Luca to the place. Take off his shirt, have cool sex, and then draw him, but here I was with a man I did not know taking me to a place where I knew nobody. Why did the moon goddess decide to be this wicked and separate two lovers from each other when we are usually mated within our pack? \nMaybe the moon goddess knew that Luca did not love me that much. How come Jenny resurfaced after seven years of death? Could she really be the one, or maybe an imposter? The only person who would give me an answer to that question is Finn, And I don't think Finn would tell me. He hates the fact that I am into Luca already.\nI wonder if Luca would take his interest in sculpting. Maybe he will. After all, already he has his muse.\n\"Penny for your thoughts?\" Finn asked, drawing me back from my thoughts.\nA smile tugged the corner of my lips. \"You don't even have a penny,\" I said, even though I knew he had money with him. All Alpha is rich.\n\"And besides, my thoughts are not that interesting,\" I said with a shrug, trying so hard to maintain my smile.\nHow would he feel if he found out that I was daydreaming about drawing Luca's body? Will he ever take an interest in what I do?\n\"Everything about you is interesting, lia,\" he said  \"Tell me what you were thinking about? Was it Luca?\" He asked with a hint of anger and jealousy.\nI swallowed whatever was in my throat. \"No. I just wanted to know If I can visit my friends before I go. I mean, none of them know I am leaving and then I want to see my guardian. She took care of me. That's if you please\" I pleaded.\nHe stared at me for a while and I wondered what he saw when he looked at my face. \"Fine, but don't try to escape, I will find you\" he warned.\nI nodded. Escape you,  where would I run to, and he seems to be watching my every move? I would not do something like that again.\n\"I won't run. I have no one to run to,\" I said.\nHe nodded. The car went back to its comfortable silence. We both to our thoughts.\n\"Please stop,\" I told the driver when we got to Lexie Street. I can't imagine that I am going to tell Lexie goodbye again.\n\"Should I come with you?\" He asked with concern as I tried stepping outside. I shook my head.\" Don't worry. She does not know you.\" I said. He nodded, he opened his mouth to say something,,  but immediately closed his mouth.\nI closed the door behind me and went to Lexie's house. I took in a heavy breath as I knocked on the door. For years she had been my best friend and had protected me even before I became Luna and I usually missed her a few times.\nIf I am being truthful, I preferred when I was not Luna. Life was easier without it, but then again I would not have met Luca.\nI knocked on the door thrice before it opened. She was putting on a shirt black leather band applied some makeup.\nHer face turned into a frown as she looked at me. She stepped aside for me to enter.\n\"What happened? You don't look happy?\" She asked, her voice laced with concern.\n\"Did something happen to Merlin? And where is Luca? Don't tell me he played with your feelings again? I thought you said you were convincing him to go on a date with you?\" She asked.\nI nodded as tears gathered in my eyes. \"I am fine, Lexie. I.. I just wanted to tell you,\"\" I informed her.\nShe raised her eyebrows \"Goodbye, eyebrows. Goodbye? Where are you going?\" She asked as she led me to a couch.\nShe disappeared into the kitchen came back with a glass of juice, and gave one to me.\n\"You know Finn is my mate,\" I said, and she nodded her head. I remember how she had asked me to stay with Luca instead of Finn.\n\"He came to take me today. I am going to his pack\" \n\"Why?\" she asked, then her eyes widened with realization. \"Oh, no,\" she muttered.\n\"Did Luca let you go just like that? what did Dean say, or did Luca betray you?\" She asked.\nI shook my head. \"He has a mate, Lexie. Jenny is alive,\" I announced.\nShe spat out the juice in her mouth as she coughed, hitting her chest a little. \"Jenny is alive? But she died seven years ago. That was the reason behind the feud between them.\"\n\"I know but she is in the palace right now with Luca\"\n\"How? I mean, how did she enter? What was her story? Why did she disappear?\" She asked.\nI shook my head. I did not know about her story. Luca had refused to open up about them. All he told me was that Dean killed his mate, who he loved and he, in return, killed his mother.\nHow come she had been with Finn all this while? Something did not just sound right between them. Could this be a ploy? \n\"Finn had her. He asked Luca to let me go and Luca refused. So he said a mate for a mate-\n\"And Luca, let you go? Seriously?\" she asked.\n\"Ahh, not exactly. He let go of me to meet Jenny. Although he begged me to stay, I refused. There was no reason to stay when he had a mate. So I left. I am going to Benedicta's place\" to tell her about the news and leave\" I informed her.\n\"So, when are we going to see each other again?\" She asked.\n\"I will always call you and maybe I will visit you one day,\" I said.\n\"Okay, I will miss you,\" she said with a trembling voice as she hugged me tightly.\n\"Me too\" I whisper back.\nBy the time we pulled away from each other, my eyes were already filled with unshed tears.\nI took a gulp of the drink and walked towards the door. \"I will see you soon,\" I said and hugged her for the last time before leaving.",

I would not want Finn to see me like this, but thinking about the fact that I might not see Lexie again brings in a fresh flow of tears.\nImmediately I got into the car, I turned my face towards the other side and pulled my hair to one side, preventing Finn from seeing my face or my pain.\n\"Do you hate me?\" Finn asks me, his deep velvet voice sending shivers down my spine, he seems closer than usual. Goosebumps cover my body, why is he so close he is me. when did he leave the other end of the car?\nI shake my head and clean the tears.  \"No, I don't. You are my mate why would I hate you?\" I ask.\n\"I don't know. Maybe for taking you away from your friends, in a short period. You have been crying since you got into the car. Seems like she was pretty close to you\"\nI nod, unable to say anything. Of course, she is close to me. She was my best friend. \"She's my best friend. It means a lot to me,\" I reply.\nHe nods and I feel him return back to the end of the car. Having him close was already enough torture. The fact that he is my mate and I am drawn towards him but I can't stop myself from thinking about Luca, and. I run my hands around my kind black hair in frustration.\nI hate when I don't know what I want.\n\"Lia, look at me,\" he commands softly. I turn around to meet his honey-brown eyes.\n\"You haven't said a word since we left the place and it's kind of sickening. I am your mate. I can feel your feelings and sometimes place my hands on your thoughts. Luca has been filling your thoughts and I know it's difficult for you, but it's hurting me. You told me that you wanted more time with the people you love. You never told me you were asking for more time with your lover. While I waited, you warmed another person's bed,\" he complained, his voice soft with pain.\nMy anger melted at once at his speech. It was true, in reality, I was his mate. He deserved some space in my heart, but I had a lot of shared memory with him.\nTo make up for my misconduct I said. \"I'm sorry\"\n\"Don't be. Just open your heart and try to give me a chance. It would be worth it,\" he promised.\nA smile tugged my lips as I nodded. \"Are you still going to see your guardian?\" He asked.\n\"Yes, it is some meters away from here,\" thanked the moon goddess reminding me about my visit.\nA few minutes later, the car stopped at Benedicta's cottage. I stepped outside, grateful that he did not offer to follow me in.\nI rang the doorbell twice, and Benedicta opened it. Her face turned into a frown as she stared at me and the convoy of cars that were at her door.\nShe stepped aside for me to come in. The nostalgic scent of herbs hit my nostrils. My foot felt so soft on her rug. The television was on, but Merlin was not in sight.\n\"Is it true?\" She asked me as I took my seat. She was standing before me, her hands on her waist. A habit that she protested anytime she was angry.\n\"About Finn?\"\n\"Yes, about Finn, and also about Luca and Jenny. Is Jenny actually back and why'd Finn take you away? I thought Luca said he would never let you go. He looked happy whenever you were around\" she inquired,,\" a hint of worry laced her voice.\n\"Yes, inquired,,\" and he truthfully did not want me to go. Besides, you don't expect me to stay there with an unloving husband, a liver who has a mate who was his first lover, and a beta who hates me, and besides, Finn seems sincere.\" I explained.\nHer face softened gradually as she inspected me. Her eyes searched my face, looking for any sign of discomfort.\n\"Do you really want to go with him?\" she asked.\n\"Yes, Finn is my mate. I don't think the moon goddess would punish me twice,\" I said and added, \"Where is Merlin?\" I asked \nMerlin ran inside from the corridor with a car toy in his hands. He hugged me tightly as he mumbled, \"Mummy\"\nTears filled my eyes. He had grown taller than last time. Tears filled his blue eyes. He broke from my embrace and took a quick glance at the room.\n\"Where is Dad?\" He asked. My heart sank at the mention of Dad. He was talking about Luca for sure.\nI cleared my throat. \"He is quite busy. I came alone\".  I informed him.\nHe looked at me with a frown for a while before he shrugged. alone, \"Okay. Come, let me show you my toy house. I made it a week ago. Benedicta helped me and Dad brought the woods for it,\" He said as he dragged my hands.\nI followed him to his room. To see the wooden house he had made with little wood. He had his cars placed around it with a doll inside.\n\"Who is this?\" I asked, opening the door.\n\"Bella. She's my friend. Dad named her,\" he informed me with delight in his voice. \nLuca never told me he visited him this often. He showed me around his wooden house for a while before Benedicta knocked.\n\"It's almost seven, lia. You have kept him waiting enough\" \n\"No. You never come by and you are to leave so early. It has not been up to two hours,\" Merlin complained.\nMy heart broke at the thought of leaving him, but I had to. \"I will be back. Next week Saturday. I promise\"\n\"No! If you leave, I will not talk to you again. I keep on asking about you and you never visit!\" He shouted.\nTears welled up in in my eyes. I felt like a failure right now. I should be with my son and give him motherly love, yet I was running away with a mate who did not know about his existence.\nHis eyes softened at my tears. \"Don't cry, mom.\" He said and cleaned my tears with his thumb.\n\"Bye,\" he said lowly and returned to his house. He did not even bother to give me a hug. He was used to letting me go.\n\"Bye, I love you,\" I said and hugged him.\nI washed my face in the washroom to make sure I looked okay and then left the house after hugging Benedicta. I would find a way to come and see him.\nI entered the car to meet Finn, still on his laptop. He just glanced at me and returned to his laptop. \nThe driver started driving. I watched as it passed the symbol of the Attic Pack. I had finally left my home to a place I did not know.",

        "content": "Lia pov\nBloodhound pack is an entirely different pack from my home. When I say they are different, I mean they have their own law and norms, but they behave differently.\nFor instance, we have an organized pack. We all know where the market is, and where the cinema is, and most of them dress according to their rank, making it easy to identify, and every commercial institution is owned by the Alpha family.\nWhereas, in Finn pack. There are different little stalls, with various cinemas and other locations and they bear different individual names lastly, I do not see anyone dressing according to their rank.\nThis is strange. I mean, how do they make their money if they don't own things and how do I know that I am not about to run into a rogue or greet a council elder with a little respect?\nClearing my throat, I decided to ask Finn, \"Who owns the cinema and other commercial places?\" I ask, clearly making sure I do not sound insulting.\n\"The wolves\" he really likes it means nothing. To me, the investment of the pack is what gives the Alpha and his family power.\n\"So how do you make your money if everything is owned by the wolves?\"\n\"We tax them and they pay,\" he replied nonchalantly his eyes still on his laptop.\n\"You mean you charge people for their hard-earned money?\" nonchalantly, I asked. My palm closed my mouth immediately the words escaped. Seems like I sounded like I was accusing them of stealing from the people.\nI remembered the only time when Dean's father had tried this policy, the elders had succeeded in almost running the pack bankrupt with high taxes. It ended in a shamble.\n\"No, lia. We have an organized system different from the ones you have. It has been in existence for a while. So be rest assured that we are not exploring them,\" he explained with a smile while his eyes gracefully grasped my body.\n\"You would make a good Luna. You seem so interested in making sure the people are well taken care of,\" he added with a smile.\nA pink hue caressed my cheeks, and I turned to the other side, noting the landscape.\nWe finally stopped at the palace. I watched as the palace gate opened, revealing a castle. It was made up of three different mansions. Beautiful birds such as peacocks stroll around. Everyone seems to be doing something. All the maids are wearing uniformed material.\nImmediately the car stops at the car pack. A guard opened the door for me to step aside. A young girl around Daina's' age rushed to me with a bowed head.\n\"My name is Annabel and I will be your new handmaid,\" she introduced herself.\nMy eyes scanned her from the hallow of her shoes to her ponytail-packed hair. Then it found dainas. She had followed me because she wanted to be with me. She is the only loyal servant who was by my side.\nFinn stood beside me. It seems they had already known that I was coming today. The walkway already had flowers adorning it.\n\"No need Annabel, I already have a handmaid who followed me from my pack,\" I said with a smile.\nShe looked shocked but kept a blank face. Her face moved to Finn's. \"She would be your second one, lia. You are a stranger here but she is the most trusted amongst all,\" he said.\nI nodded quietly and took his palm. My palm felt so small on its own. The guards and the maid followed us at our back in absolute silence.\nWe got to the center building and entered inside. Everyone was so busy, that they immediately bowed and continued their duty.\n\"This is my house. This is where we are going to be staying,\" he said.\nAs if in a clue. The other servant rushed upstairs. Maybe here, in to arrange my thing.\n\"Do you like the palace?\" He asked and added, \"If you don't, we can change the decoration to suit your taste,\" he said.\nI shook my head even though I loved white than the black aesthetic that his house had. Later,. Maybe later, added, when I had gotten comfortable with it, I would ask for a change.\n\"Come, let me show you around, \" he said. I followed him to a large room upstairs. It had canvas and different paints. \n\"This is our gallery. You can paint and draw in it,\" he said.\n\"A gallery?\" I asked. Who the hell had a gallery in his house? Seems their pack is way richer than mine.\n\"Yes, I figured out that you are an artist and decided to have a gallery for you,\" he said with a smile.\nI narrow my eyes to a split. How did you know I am an artist\" I asked.\nA dark chuckle escaped my lips \"Trust me Lia I know everything about you including things Dean never knew about\"\nOh, my god. With the way he talked with confidence, Oh, it meant he knew much about me.\nPanic rose between me. What about Merlin?",

She just left with Finn.\nI know I was kind of a coward for hugging Jenny when she came, but I missed her. I had always missed her. I missed her to the point that my heart ached at the mention of her name. So it was only natural to hug her, but I expected Lia to understand and not just decide to leave me alone. \nDoes she think she would be happy there? With a man that she does not know? Finn might even try to harm her and she has no one.\nI rake my hands on my hair as different thoughts cross my mind. Jenny is in my room waiting for me to come and talk to her as usual. If it was the former me, I would have done that. Maybe kiss her all the way to the bedroom and make love to her, but I was different. Lia had changed me and left with a part of me.\n\"You know you eventually have to talk to her?\" Dean said, breaking me from my thoughts.\nI glared at him with disdain. \"Since when did my life become your business?\" I asked him. I knew Jenny was the root of the problem, but that did not change the fact that he tried killing me a few times. He was the one who started with the stabbing saga.\nHe shrugs. \"Come on, man, she is alive. What is the reason for the beef? I let you have Lia even though she was my wife because I was sorry. But now she is here and Lia is gone. You have your mate and I have no one, no mate, no wife, no Luna,\" he explained.\nA part of my heart melted at his pathetic speech but that did not change the fact of what he did over the past years. He talks as if he mistakenly tried to kill Jenny when in reality it was worse than that. He wanted to have sex with her and even asked her to cheat on me several times.\nI blame him for everything. If he had not done this, I would have not bothered following Lia to take revenge. And if I did not follow her to speak, avenge him, I would never have fallen for her. My life would have been so simple, with no feelings attached to it, and I would have gone back to Jenny immediately. She returned instead of pacing around here, trying to remember why I fell for her the first time.\nI know she is my mate but the bond I shared with Lia is stronger than this. What should I do?\nAs if in a clue, Jenny strolled outside to meet me and Dean. Our eyes locked with each other, with no feeling attached. Normally my heart would have been out of my chest by mating low, but our gaze felt empty and irritating.\nI drew my eyes from her face and gazed down at her body. Fuck! Not moved. I didn't even get a lustful erection, now, which was strange because only looking at lia eyes, I would have been on the ground by now.\n\"Luca, you can't even look at me,\" she said slowly with pain.\nMy jaw clenched as I looked at her, forcing myself to say the obligatory word \"I'm sorry. I have been busy,\" I lied. \nI have not been busy. I do not just want to see you. You are not my lia.\nThe maids came in with boxes and advanced towards my room side. \"Where are you going with this luggage?\" I asked.\nAnnabel answered, \"She instructed us to take it to the room next to yours,\" she said.\n\"No! You wouldn't. You would not move her things into Lia's room. Take it elsewhere,\" I said without thinking. It felt like a sacrilege or like I was cheating on Lia for me to move my mate's things into her room.\nI can't. I can't just let everything go like that. That room held memories. Memories I would not want to erase.\n\"Why? Lia has a mate, Luca. She is gone,\" Jenny said as a matter of fact.\nI walked past them and turned towards them. \"Take it to the guest room,\" I ordered and turned to Jenny. \"We are not yet married. You do not get to disappear for seven years and reappear and think I would accept you\" \n\"But-\" she began.\nBut I raised my palmitate,, years signaling her to shut up. \"I have had enough for today,\" I said and walked towards my room.\nEverything still reminded me of her. Her lavender hair scent still lingered around my room.\nI sat on my bed with an empty soul. I picked up my pillow and sniffed it, without exhaling. I let her scent intoxicate me and remind me of how her long black hair caressed my face when I tickled her.\nA knock on the door interrupted my thought. I groaned as I saw Jenny walk inside with a calm look. She still has that milky creamy body and blue eyes. Eyes, but nothing felt attractive again.\nShe stood before me with soft eyes \"What do you want?\" I asked, lacking patience.\nShe sat beside me and I felt tempted to send her out, saying, \"You have changed, Luca.\"\nI scoffed. out, \"What were you expecting? For me to sit here and wait for you. Were you expecting me to still be in love with you?\" I asked her. \nShe nodded \"Yes. I was away for seven years and I am still in love with you,\" she said in a gentle tone.\nWhat the hell? Did she take me for a fool or what? She expected me to remain in love with her after catching her in bed with my cousin? Seriously",

Or has cheating also eaten your interpretation aspect?\" \n\"Luca, I am sorry,\" she apologized.\nA chuckle escaped my lips \"You cheated on me and left without a single word and you expect me to still be in love with you? You still expect me to worship your cheating ass?\" I asked angrily.\nA glint of anger passed through her eyes as she took in deep lips. sorry, breath to control herself and spoke in a sensually soft voice, \"I am sorry Luca, Dean left me with no choice\"\n\"Well, I left you with a choice, and that is to be with me. Be my mate and stand by me, out of choice, but you didn't. instead, you opened your legs for my cousin the moment I was gone and claimed he killed you\"\nShe scoffed, looking unapologetic. \"You criticize me as if Lia did not open her legs for you while her husband was here\"\nThat was it. That was the sign I needed to throw her out of my room. I grabbed her by her hair and dragged her up.\n\"Say another word about Lia and I would make the lie you told about your death come to life. Get. Out.\" I ordered.\n\"Seriously? You are sending me out for lia?\"\n\"Yes, and I would have sent you out for anyone. Now Get out and make sure you're in the guest house and not in the Lia room.\nShe rearranged her clothes and walked toward the door and opened it. She stopped on her track and turned to me.\n\"We are not yet over and for your information. Lorenzo is here,\" she said and left.\nSeriously! Can I be left alone for a moment? Like, just one moment without anyone offering me sympathy or showing their whorish presence.\nWhat on earth did Lorenzo want from me now? I thought I had told Dean to stay away from me. \nLorenzo walked inside with squared shoulders and his permanent poker face oozing his cowardice. He stopped before me with a grin. He scanned through my entire room and returned to my face. His grin is still intact.\n\"If you knew how stupid you look with that grin you would wipe it off and say whatever brought you here\"\nHis grin grew awkwardly wider before it disappeared immediately. \"I see you haven't gotten over Lia. You actually fell for her?\" He asked, his voice softer than usual.\nI struggled to defer if he was saying this out of pity or amusement. What happened to his sarcastic badass tone?\n\"What do you want?\" I asked with a serious tone. I did not care if he was here as a friend or as a beta or as a coward.\n\"We have an enemy inside, sarcastic,\" he pointed out. I furrowed my eyebrows. What did he mean by an enemy inside? All our minds were asked to swear an oath of loyalty before the moon goddess asking her to take their life if they ever turned against us in any way.\n\"And who is this enemy?\" I asked.\nHe cleared his throat, and looked at me for a while as if he was trying to predict how I was going to react to what he was about to say \"Jenny\"\nMy eyes narrowed to a split. \"Jenny?\" I asked, and he nodded.\n\"How?\"\nHe took a step towards \"\"She is an enemy. We are not even sure if she is a witch. We are not sure if she is an imposter and why would she come back to the pack if not because she wanted something and believe it or not? \"Dean was not the one who ordered her death. Do you think if Dean was pursuing her, he would give her a chance to write a letter to you claiming that Dean was after her? Yes, he might have slept with her, but he would not want to kill you. We were like brothers back then and you and I know he loved you,\" he explained.\nI raised my eyebrows as I glanced at him. Wondering where he was going. \"So,. What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\"Dean wants us to meet at his office right now and talk. We need to know what Jenny wants before we accept her,\" he said with urgency.\nI nodded and followed him to the Dean's office. He sat in his chair while a maid poured wine into three fresh glasses.\nHe gestured at both of us to sit down. I sat beside Lorenzo, still carrying a frown on my face.\n\"What do you have that is so important to say?\"\nHe raised his glass to the air. \"First, I would like to offer a truce to us,\" he said.\nLorenzo raised his glass to the air, waiting for me to raise mine. I glared at them. \" And how am I sure that this drink is not poisoned?\" I asked with a frown.\n\"It is not, Luca. We were friends and brothers,\" Dean said.\nI looked at them for a while, studying their expression before I raised the glass. Not like I trusted them. The only person I trusted was gone, so there was really no need.\nHe clicked the glass and took a gulp before he said, \"What do you know about Jenny? Her appearance is so sudden,\" he said.\nA smile crept on my lip. I leaned into the chair. \" Well, I know she was my mate. I know you fucked her and I know you wanted to get the dead,\" I said nonchalantly.\nDean pinched the bridge of his nose. \"Luca, I am being serious. Does she have any background or anyone outside here that she might have gone to?\" He asked.\n\"Well, I think that question should be for Finn because he was the one that brought her back and took my life with him\"\nHe raised an eyebrow. \"You do realize that you are talking about my wife,\" he said with a tone of entitlement. \nI scoffed and tilted my head. \"Whatever,\" I said and sat up. \"I don't know anything about her, but I think we can ask Sabrina. But for the time being, I don't want her in Lia's room and I am serious. If we are to remain friends,\" I declared. \nHe seemed taken aback by the tone of my voice or how obsessed I was with his wife but that's none of my business.\nHe could call her his wife for all I cared. We both know who owned her. She was mine immediately, I set my eyes on her.\nA knock came on the door and a guard entered. \"Sabrina is here,\" he said\n\"Let her in,\" he ordered.\nSabrina walked in with a smile and she was dressed in a long flowing gown, and a long coral bead necklace. She turned to me with a smile.\n\"I have a message for you,\" she said in a dreadful calm voice",

        "content": "Luca pov\n\"I have a message for you,\" Sabrina said smiling at me. \nI looked at Dean and Lorenzo. They both had raised eyebrows on their faces as they scanned Sabrina's face, trying to detect what was wrong. Why would she be here?\nI sat up, facing her. \"Go on,\" I said with a tone of nonchalance. Trying my best to convey to her that she could say anything before them.\nShe glanced at them and then at the office. She walked around the office, her heels making a sound.\n\"serious?\" She asked with a raised eyebrow, her voice deepened with anger as she glared at me.\nI nodded. She plastered a smile on her face and continued walking around.\n\"Nice decor,\" she said in an overly bored tone. I rolled my eyes in return. She has been to the place before. Why would she be saying that?\nI heaved a sigh \"sigh. Sabrina, you have been here before. Don't you think that is an unnecessary compliment?\" I asked.\nShe stopped and smiled at me, then used her fingers to caress the shelves. And don't you think it is foolish of you to join hands with your enemy?\" She asked.\nDean's nostrils flared. He had never liked Sabrina right from time. \"We are one now,\" he said. \nA chuckle escaped her lips. \"Why?\" She asked.\nDean opened his mouth to talk but she shunned him \"Oh, I know the reason. Jenny is back, so everyone is back to being friends. Right?\" She asked \nDean curled his hands into a fist on the table. This was the reason he hated witches. If it was a wolf talking to him like that, the wolf would have been dead before saying the next word. But Sabrina was a witch. The highest witch in the pack. She can never be tamed.\n\"Get. Out\" he ordered.\nShe glared at him and turned to me. \"Come with me,\" she said.\nI looked at them and at her. Lorenzo nodded his head in acceptance and I left with her.\nShe strolled towards my room and closed the door behind her as soon as I entered.\n\"What is the meaning of that?\" I asked, feigning ignorance.\n\"What is the meaning of what you just portrayed in the Dean's office? How did Dean form an alliance with you?\" She asked, her voice deep with anger.\nI moved from the door I was leaning on to my bed. \"Jenny is back. It means that there is no need to hold Dean responsible for her death. So I decided it's time we go back to the way we were before Jenny came,\" I replied. I knew she would be angry with me for becoming friends with Dean after what he did to me, but I also wronged him. I also tried to kill him.\nShe moved towards me, her veins throbbing by her neck as she tried to curtail her anger. She bent towards me, glaring at me for a while before taking a calm breath.\n\"Let me remind you about your life before Jenny came. You were a rogue and were occasionally mocked by Dean and Lorenzo. In fact, they insulted you in front of the entire pack. While you took it as a joke, they gradually mocked you before everyone's eyes. Everyone knew you as a weak rogue and when you found your mate, he became jealous. He mocked your affair and advised you to leave her whenever you and Jenny quarreled only for him to jump back to her bed the moment you were gone and when you tried to attack him. Lorenzo told you to loosen up and that she was just a girl while you and I know that if anything were to happen to his mate. When the time came to choose sides, he chose Dean's side not because he likes Dean more but because it is safer. Dean tried killing you so many times, all in the name of Lia and you, and I know that he doesn't love her that much, and let's not forget that Lorenzo attacked you when you tried to save Lia. I was the one who rescued you. Now that Jenny is back, do you think she is back because she missed you?\" She asked.\n\"Do you think she would choose you over the opportunity of becoming a  Luna? choose You are a hybrid! Luca! a hybrid! But they have looked down on you for so long, calling you a rogue. You are a hybrid! Be a hybrid and not a rogue! Be as cunning as Jenny and Dean and as wise as Lorenzo. Don't ever make the mistake of trusting them and I thought you loved Lia? She asked in a hoarse voice.\nI swallowed hard. \"I do,\" I replied in a deep voice. With Jenny around I have not thought about Lia.\nShe shook her head. \"No, you don't,\" she said, her voice filled with disappointment and blame.\n\"I do! You know I love her, but she left me! She left me for Finn. She just walked away even though I told her to stay,\" I retorted. I can't believe she is the one blaming me. I sacrificed a lot for Lia. Gave up my identity for her.\n\"Stay? Stay with a man who has a mate. A man who hugged his mate passionately?\" She asked in a sarcastic tone.\nMy nostrils flared as I curled my hand. \"You were not there\" \n\"Oh yes, I was. I saw it. What is the use of my magic if not to use it for my advantage\" she asked.\nI inhaled sharply. So she knew. Why was she blaming me? I pinched the bridge of my nose.,\" \"Sabrina, okay, fine. You have blamed me for all you want. What do I do? And since you are omniscient, why is Jenny here?\" I asked.\nA smile of satisfaction tugged her lips. Of course, she loved being acknowledged.\n\"Firstly, always put lia first. And Jenny, never trust her. She does not seem pure. Make sure no one knows about your ability,\" she warned.\nI nodded even though I was disappointed because she did not know what Jenny wanted.\nShe opened her mouth to say something but shut it when a knock interrupted our conversation.\n\"Are you expecting someone?\" She asked.\nI shrugged \"I am a Royal. I am always needed\"\nHer face changed into a frown as she pointed at me. \"Be careful,\" she warned and walked towards the door.\nI followed her back to see who was at the door. My face turned into a frown when I saw Jenny.\nSeriously? Can I be left alone?\nSabrina looked at me with a warning gaze and left me to my ex-mate.",

        "content": "Luca pov.\nI groaned in frustration immediately I saw Jenny's plastered smile. Seriously? What did this girl want? I thought I drove her out of my room a moment ago. Frustration washed within me, itching my skin. I needed time to concentrate, time to think about what Sabrina just said. To know which side I should be on. What I needed was a cool bath, playing Lia's white Mustang, a song I felt was too feminine till now. Now that she was gone, I would gladly attach myself to anything that would give me a close connection with Lia. Not this twat that was standing before me with a fake smile.\n\"What do you want?\" I asked with a bored expression. I did not even try to hide my anger.\nHer face fell as I spoke. \"you seem so in a hurry to dismiss me,\" she said in a disappointed tone.\nI nodded, too tired to kid or feign concern. \"Yes. Jenny, I want to be left alone\"\n\"But I am your mate and we need to work things out. You know that. Lia is gone and I am here. She is properly fucking Finn\"\nAnger itched within my skin. I closed my eyes to unheard what she just said. And block my mind from the image that flooded my vision. Images of Lia's pink full lip wrapped around his cock.\nI knew what she was trying to do. She was trying to get into my head, trying to make me hate Lia but that is something that was never going to work. I would never hate Lia.\nI faced her this time ready to watch her disappointed face \"Keep Lia out of your mouth and keep this at the back of your mind that not everyone is like you. Some people are loyal. Now get out,\" I said, banging the door against her.\nShe put her feet in between the door, stopping it from closing. I raked my hands through my hair as irritation spiked within me.\n\"I have heard what you said, but we are not done. I am not leaving here until we talk like couples\"\n\"That's the thing, Jenny. We are not couples and we will never be now leave!\" I shouted as anger burst within me.\nThe guards by the side of the door flinched at the impact of my outburst.\n\"No! Luca. We are not done. We are not over! I came back for you and I will not stop till I get you,\" she shouted with desperation as tears filled her eyes.\nAnd for a moment I was tempted to believe her that she came here for my sake, but I knew she did not. For the past seven years, she did not bother contacting me or anyone at all. She left everything behind.\nI heaved a sigh and stepped aside for her to come in, not because my heart had softened but because I knew Jenny. She never gave up.\nShe walked in and sat on the bed. I stood in front of her, refusing to leave.\nHer eyes softened as she looked at me. \"Look Luca, I know you hate me, but people make mistakes. I made a mistake by having an affair with your cousin but believe me when I say he tricked me. You also cheated on me with Lia but I would forgive you and put everything behind if you will. I still love you, Luca,\" she said. She looked at me for a while, waiting for an outburst from me before she continued.\n\"You know, when I escaped from Luca I wanted to die. To give up and leave this world, but each time I did that, I imagine the raw pain you would feel if I died and I lived. I knew we were going to reunite together, and that we were going to have Vermont,\" she said.\nA smile tugged my lip at the hearing of Vermont. It was a place I had foolishly promised her that I would take her to after my marriage.\nWhatever she just said was true. I felt pain when she left for a while. I thought of consuming suicide. Especially when I was sent out of the pack for treason, but Sabrina saved me. That is why I would always be grateful to her, even though she is a pain in the ass.\n However, what pissed me off in this heartfelt speech she just gave was the right she had to tell me that I cheated on her with Lia. It is ridiculous. You don't ever refer to love as cheating.\nI turned to her to examine her face, her brown eyes, and those lips I once lusted after. I obeyed every word that came out of my lips, but I would never do that again.\n\"Lia was not a fling Jenny. I fell in love with her. You know how I used to allow you to have a threesome with Bianca. I could not bring myself to have the thought of seeing anyone with Lia but me. I could not cope with the idea of someone having her body, be it male or female. Ask Dean I fought with him because he tried to have her. That is love, Jenny. I wanted a smile on her face over everything. We are different, Jenny,\" I said.\nHer jaw tightened with anger. \"Luca you can't deny that you never felt a thing for me but since you have decided to, I would leave you at that for now. Soon you will come crawling towards me. You have always enjoyed my pussy over others,\" she said, then smiled at me.\n\"Till then I propose I offer a truce. We become partners and I can help bring down Dean and Finn together. He wronged me and I want to get back at him, Finn also Wronged me and they deserve to die,\" she said with a creepy smile.\nBile welled up within me. I can't believe that I was once in love with this girl. She came back to seek revenge on Finn and  Dean. \nI leaned toward her only keeping a little space between us \"Now listen to me you obnoxious brat if you lay a hand on Dean I would have your head and if you kill Finn or try to do that and harm Lia I would use your name to make a perfect horror story. The Luca you know is gone now,\" I said and grabbed her by her hair as I dragged her out.\nGood riddance.",

        "content": "Lia pov.\nDread crept into my skin at Finn's words. He fixed his gaze on me with a permanent creepy smile. What was he talking about? What did he know about me that others did not know?\nI swallowed hard as I tried to pacify whatever was willing up within. I cleaned my hand on my skirt even though I knew my face was filled with guilt already.\n\"What are you talking about?\" I asked in a sudden, calm voice that contrasted how I was feeling inside.\nHe shrugged and strolled towards me, his arms wrapped against his chest. \"Well, I did a brief check\" up on you. I got to know about who raised you. What is her name again?\" He asked.\nFear blocked my throat as I tried to speak \"Benedicta\" I said.\nHe nodded.\"Thanks for the correction. Don't mind me, I forgot about her nod. But with time, I would meet her. You know, I don't have a mother of my own, so my wife's mother would automatically be mine. Who is that boy that lives with her?\" He asked.\nAt this time, sweat was already tricking down my spine. Heat cloaked my skin even though the air can was on. Maybe it was because he was really close and also because of the question he just asked.\nHe knew Merlin. Someone knew about Merlin's existence. It was really dangerous. Imagine he got to know about him. Would he kill me and my son? Would he seize him and take him as a hostage to mock Dean? Gosh! Dean might even deny Merlin. What would I do? Images of Merlin shouting my name to free him while he was locked behind bars filled my head.\n\"Lia!\" I could hear Merlin or Dean shouting at me. \"Lia!\" The voice came again, this time closer than usual.\nThe snap of fingers at my front brought me back from my thoughts. \"I asked you a question,\" Finn said.\nI flinched and turned to him. \"What?\" I asked in a scared voice.\n\"I asked who it was. the boy, Benedicta is always with\"\n\"He.. He.. he is her sister's son. The sister died while giving birth,\" I said.\nSympathy watched his face as his eyes softened. He placed his hands on my shoulders. I am so sorry. Was that the reason why you seemed uncomfortable when I asked the story? Look lia. I would never bring it up again. Just wanted to know more about you\" he said.\nI nodded with understanding. Of course. He did not know the implication of what he just asked.\nHe drew me in for a hug, wrapping his arms around my waist. I sniffed his scent and reasoned the scent that filled my nose was identical to Luca's scent. I closed my eyes to the comfort of the scent as it calmed my fear. Gradually, I wrapped my arms around his back.\nHe stroked my back trying to soothe me, but all I could think of was Luca. He used to comfort me this way, especially when I got scared of Merlin's safety. \n\"Aww, you are already hugging each other,\" a high-pitched feminine voice said.\nI quickly drew myself out of the hug even though I felt reluctance rumble over his body. I turned to meet a girl standing at our front with a wide, white smile. A man stood close to her, his arms on her waist. Maybe he was her husband.\nShe was wearing a long blue bodycon dress, enhancing her shape. She packed her hair high ponytail with a dropping blue earring. Her bag was also blue, and she had shades of blue blush on her face. She seemed to have a\" blue color.\nFinn cleared his throat as he introduced her\" Lia, meet Ava, my younger sister\" he said.\nShe threw her hands into the air.\" I am his twin sister. He is not older than me. I just let him go before me to see the world, then came out two minutes later.\" She said with a playful smile.\n\"Blab for all you want, Ava. I am your older brother,\" he said.\nI looked at the both of them, brother, trying to see the difference between them. They actually looked alike.\n\"I am lia. His mate,\" I said.\nShe nodded with a knowing smile. Of course, she knew that I was his mate. I don't think her twin brother would keep such a secret from her. \nThe man beside him walked towards me and stretched forth his hands. \"I am Killian, Ava's mate, and Finn's best friend\" he introduced while I took his handshake. They seem to be united.\n\"Oh please, you are my brother-in-law \"\" Friend,, you seized being my best friend the day you looked at my sister with lustful eyes, \"\" Finn replied with a smile even though anger laced his tone.\nKilan gave him a tight smile. \"Losen up man. It would do you some good,\" he said.\nFinn's muscles tightened as he glared at him, while the killer \" returned his look with a smile.\n\"Let me show you around,\" Ava said to brighten up the tense mood. I guess Finn had refused to forgive his best friend for fucking his sister.\nFinn drew me to himself as he tightened his arm around me. \"She just arrived.\"We're not done talking,\" he said in a deadpan serious tone. Then, to ease the tension, he said, \"Stop looking at me like that. You have your husband. Let me spend time with my mate,\" he said.\nAva nodded. Mate, \"Yeah, spend all the day with her. I would still be closer to her than you,\" she said and hugged me. \"I am so happy. I finally have a sister,\" she said and walked away with Killian.\nAs soon as they were gone, Finn turned to me. She can be clingy sometimes,\" he apologized.\nI nodded my head with understanding. \"And what about Killian? You seem to have a tension between the both of you,\" I said.\nOf that, his eyes darkened for a while as he looked at me. He broke my trust. Slept with my sister. I would have forgiven him for that, but he broke her heart again and when he discovered she had a mate, he killed the mate. He denied her that, the comfortable late bond,\" He said, his voice filled with pain.\n\"My sister might have forgiven him but I can't,\" he said.\nI opened my mouth to say something but,\" he dragged me \"Come,, but let me show you the other side of the palace\"",

We would be having a party tomorrow where I would introduce you to everyone as their Luna,\" he said,,\" his arms wrapped around my waist as we stood inside the hall. \nI restrained the urge to remove his arms from my body. How can he be so comfortable? I mean, we just met, and he is already all warm and cozy.\n\"They have all been waiting for you. You don't know how thankful I am that I met you and that you agreed to follow me even when you had a thing with your husband's brother,\" he said in a nonjudgmental tone.\nI bit my tongue from telling him that he was the love of my life and probably the only man I would ever give my heart to. Luca had shown me how great love can be. Just the thought of him comforted me.\nInstead of telling him those words, I asked, \"You talk as if I am some savior you have been waiting for. Surely you would have been sleeping with someone else\"\n\"Nahh. I am not really the flirting type and it scared the shit out of me when I could not find a mate especially since my sister and everyone around me have found one and you know the power of an Alpha is his mate,\" he said.\nI nodded even though I did not understand how the power of an Alpha lay in his mate\n I did not bother asking. Although I felt thankful that he had been waiting for me.\nFor a moment, I wondered what it would be like if I fell in love with him. Would he treat me like Luca did? Would he put me first before everything?\n\"I did not have a wolf when I met Dean. Or I had a wolf, but it wasn't a strong one. Dean was disappointed. Very disappointed. He rejected me immediately, but his father insisted we get married,\" I said and turned to him.\n\"Would you have rejected me if you found out that I did not have a wolf?\" I asked. I needed to know. Because Luca loved me even when I did not have my wolf. He was the one who persuaded Sabrina to do the ritual that made me regain my wolf. I wondered what life would have been like without him. I would have still been in the restaurant serving wolves.\nHe turned towards me, and his eyes scanned my face. \"I would have loved you for who you are,\" he said as he caressed my cheek. \n\"Let's go,\" he said as he took me round the palace.\nWe stopped at the third building. \", This is the staff quarters, and this is also where the main cooking takes place.\" He explained as we entered inside.\nAll the maids bowed down as we walked past them. The place suddenly became quiet. It felt strange to be accorded such respect. I mean, in Dean's palace; they bowed before me but gossiped at my back. They never kept quiet because of me.\nA tall model-like lady walked towards me and bowed at the both of us. She took my hands and said \"My Luna\" before kissing it.\nThen she turned to Finn., they maintained eye contact with each other for a while \"I will be back\" he said and left me in the middle of everyone's attention.\nShock filled me. Who could be that girl that he willingly left me for? He could have said he was busy or had the courtesy to return me back to my room? I didn't even know the way around.\nI stared at the clock. It was seven o'clock. Pain bottled my chest at the thought of what I and Luca would have been doing. \nWe would have been in his room or mine eating our meal and after that I would play Lana Del Rey's music just to annoy him and we would talk till it was eleven before we had sex or maybe he would have started the foreplay after food. He seemed to have joy teasing me, making me beg for more.\nI closed my eyes as my nipples tightened at the thought of his tongue on my nipples. Sometimes he bit to share and other times he just teased them, making me ask for more.\nI wondered if he would share the same routine with Jenny.\n\"My Luna, I would like you to go back to your room. Seems the Alpha had more pressing matters to attend to,\" Annabel nodded, said,,\" drawing me out of my lustful thoughts.\nI turned to her and nodded, her words ringing in my ear. It seems the Alpha had more pressing issues to attend to.\nWhat could be so pressing that he left me for? As I walked back, the chilly breeze caressed my skin. It made me realize how lonely I was here. Luca would never leave me. He would either forgo what he had for me or explain the reason he had to leave me. Then he would peck me on my forehead before leaving. Here I was with no attention from anyone.\nI walked back to my room in silence. Immediately after I got to the door, I turned to \"Annabel. \"Tell Daina I need to see her,\" I said.\nShe nodded before saying, \"I could help you with whatever errand you want to send her. I am also at your service, \"she said.\n\"Don't worry. I just need her to do something for me. I will call you if I need your service,\" I said and closed the door.\nA few minutes later, Daina came inside with a smile. \"You called me\"\n\"Yes. Have you ever been to this pack before?\" I asked.\nShe nodded \"Yes. Once\" she added.\n\"Okay. We would go for a stroll this night,\" I said.\n\"A stroll?\" She asked,\" clearly surprised. I have thought and asked for her company, but I was surprised, I did not need it.\n\"Yes, Daina, a stroll. You are the only one that can keep me company. He left me and I have no one to talk to,\" I explained.\nHer eyes softened, and she nodded with a smile and left.\nImmediately after she left, my phone beeped. My heart skipped at the name that popped on my screen. It was Luca.\nI clicked on the message. Tears filled my eyes as it read.\n\"I know you are meant to be with your mate and it is honestly rude of me to text you at this time, but I just wanted you to know that I missed you a lot. I can't imagine that I am playing Lana Del Rey while on the bed alone. Do you remember what would have happened if we were together? I guess you would. We had an unfinished conversation before we left. I was wondering if we could meet and talk,\" it read.",

After so many years I had finally gotten Luca to my side. During this year I had come to discover how cruel he can be if he is angry.\nWith him by my side together with Lorenzo, we could withstand anything Jenny had in mind. Because if there was one thing I was sure of is that Jenny had a hidden motive. She did not come back because she was in love with Luca or she missed him. She came back for something and was trying to use Luca's weakness to get and thankfully Luca had outgrown his bond for her.\nAlthough he did not tell me I got to know when he ordered her to stay in the guest house. The Luca I knew would never do that. He would rather die than spend a night without her.\n\"Do you think he is still going to be on our side?\" Lorenzo asked a few minutes after Sabrina had successfully whisked Luca out of our mist.\nI looked at him and nodded. \"He has no one except us,\" I said. With Lia gone, he had no one to truly rely on and whether he liked it or not, not, we were family.\n\"No, Dean, you are getting it all wrong. He has Sabrina, he has Jenny and we all know he still has a firm hold on Lia, \"he countered anxiously. Fear laced his tone as if he was scared of the possibility of having a dangerous duo formed from Sabrina and Luca.\nI was tempted to believe him, but I refused. I knew that he was trying to play the safe game. He always wanted to be on the safe side. \n\"He is not like that. He wants us to be united,\" I said with a little hope.\nLorenzo stood up and walked close to me before sitting at my table. \"Yes, I would agree with you, but feel that in this case, it is different. Sabrina would stop at nothing to get him to the throne because he resonated with the witches. His mother was her friend\".\n\"She is on his side and not ours, and don't even make the mistake of telling me that she is going to be on our side if Luca is with us. It would be a big lie. She despises you. You wanted her dead at a point. We can't afford to be too trustful. There is already a hybrid lurking in the shadows. We have Jenny and the witches all fighting for the throne. Let's not forget that you could not produce an heir. Your reign is threatened,\" he explained.\nI leaned back in my chair as I absorbed what he said. Even though Luca wanted peace, Sabrina could not convince him to do otherwise.\n\"So what would you have me do?\" I asked, clearly tired. I wanted peace, wanted the former bond we had with Luca and not the current one. Sometimes I miss him.\n\"Firstly, you would look for a wife, someone who could bear an heir for you, and then you find a way to get on Sabrina's good side. We are supernatural, but they hold us together,\" he said.\nA knock on the door disrupted our discussion. Lorenzo walked back to his seat while I asked whoever was there to come in.\nThe door opened, revealing Sabrina. I curled my hands into a fist as I stared at him. What did she want from us?\nShe strolled in with her usual smile. \"What do you want?\" Lorenzo asked in a sharp tone. Thank goodness. I wasn't the only one who found her annoying.\n\"I just wanted to inform you that there are whispers everywhere,\" she said.\nI raised an eyebrow. Whispers about what? They never got tired of whispering. Or was she just here to pull my leg? I shook my head as I pushed the thought away. \n\"About what?\" I asked.\n\"About the crown and the legitimacy of the crown. They feel you are weak to allow an enemy to take your wife all in the name of him. Being her mate. And also the hybrid has started killing more people on the outskirts of the town. Go for a walk tomorrow morning and you will find out that half of the people would not respect you the way they usually do. They now see you as a failure,\" she said in a mocking tone.\nMy nostrils flared as I tried hard not to believe her. She could be lying. The people can't see me as weak. I was too strong for that.\n\"Why are you telling me?\" I inquired, knowing fully well that she never loved me.\nShe shrugged. Inquired, \"I just felt like sharing it with you to disrupt whatever evil thought you have of killing Luca. If he gets hurt now, they would see you as a tyrant. So guide him from you, your beta, and Jenny,\" she said, then bowed slightly. \"My alpha,\" she said and left.\nImmediately she left Lorenzo banged his fist on the table,\" a \"moment I thought the table would crack from his force.\n\"That twat is playing a scheming game,\" she needs to go. She is trying to protect Luca after poisoning his mind against us and we can't do anything about it\", he complained.\nI nodded, too tired to reply. I knew whatever she was saying was true. It could be a cloud by Finn. To mock me by taking my wife from me. At first, I was not bothered because I did not have a bond with her., and Luca did. That was why he was devastated and I was not.\nBut I can't be weak before people. I needed to do something. I needed to do something about it.\nI turned to look at Lorenzo, who was still pouring his hatred for Sabrina.\n\"We need to act fast. My father was feared and respected and I want the same for myself\"\nHe furrowed his eyebrow as he tried to detect what I was saying.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"We need to bring back Lia. She is my wife\"\n\"Have you gone mad? How do you expect Luca to react to Lia and Jenny with him?\" He asked.\n\"He will have to forgo one,\" I said and added, \"Ask one of our maids to get Luca's phone. I need to send a message to her through his phone. I need to talk to her,\" I said \n\"She is going to be Finn's wife,\" Lorenzo said, trying to convince me to change, but I disagreed.\n\"Not yet. For now, she is still my wife and I need to see her\"\n\"You know Finn is not going to let you in,\" he said\nI shrugged, not like I care. \"He would not know that I am out. Now do,\" I ordered in a curt voice, stopping him from probing further.",

        "content": "Dean pov.\nI watched Lorenzo's shocked face as I professed my desire to bring Lia back. I knew it was risky but what was more risky was allowing Finn to get away with what he did. Up until now, I had always thought it was better for Lia to go. She brought a side of Luca that no one brought a raw side that can be activated by her tears or complaints. Yes, he was a rogue, but I would rather not have issues with him. Even with him being a rogue he had perfectly managed to send my mother to the land of no return.\nI stared at my laptop screen as I waited for Lorenzo to bring in Luca's phone. Did I know how he would get it? No. But will he get it? Yes, because he was a cunning twat.\nAs expected Lorenzo knocked on my door an hour later when I was already engrossed in my work.\n\"Come in\" I  and he walked in with a frown on his face. He glared at me; sometimes, I forgot he was my best friend.\n\"Did you get what I asked for?\" I asked my attention still on the screen.\n\"Y,e,s but-\" he begged,  but I held my hands in his hand, signaling him to stop. I have had enough of his convincing today. If he could not see what was going on then it was not my fault. I would not lose my respect and fear before the eyes of the people.\nI stretched forth my hand, willing him to bring the phone. He placed the phone in my hand as satisfaction watched over me.\nI took out the phone and started typing, \"I know you are meant to be with your mate, and it is honestly rude of me to text you at this time, but I just wanted you to know that I missed you a lot. I can't imagine that I am playing Lana Del Rey while on the bed alone. Do you remember what would have happened if we were together? I guess you would. We had an unfinished conversation before we left. I was wondering if we could meet and talk,\" I wrote and clicked send.\nI tapped her WhatsApp to see her beautiful photo. She was standing in the museum caressing a photo. Seems she had things for painting.\n\"You are making a big mistake,\" Lorenzo said, and I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. Seriously, I thought he had gotten the message. I will not back down until I have Lia by my side. Maybe I would give Lia a chance since Luca should be with his mate, although I doubt he still loved her.\nIf so, I need to call Jenny and make sure she turns Luca's attention to her side. I would not want to continue the banter with Luca.\n\"I have already made a mistake by allowing Finn to take Lia,\" I said.\n\"No! The mistake you are making is trying to win back the lia's heart. You and I know that she doesn't love you\" he reminded me.\n\"Love does not matter. The people want their luna back. this is where she belongs not Bloodhound Pack\"\nI tossed the phone to his side for him to return it to Luca. Instead, the twat took the phone and read the mistake, and started whining as usual.\n\"You are blackmailing her. You know that, right? How do you think Luca would react if he found out you used his phone to lure her out of her place? He is trying to forget her, for Christ's sake. I don't get the reason why you always choose Sabrina's word over mine!\" He shouted \nA chuckle escaped my lips as I raised my head to look at his face, masked with a frown. \n\"Sabrina is a witch and more powerful than us. You said that and you expect me to leave her opinion for yours? Seriously? And besides, if I messaged her, you and I know that she would not come, so put the phone back where you saw it before we alert Luca,\"  I ordered.\nHe opened his mouth to say something but closed he pressed his lips together when he saw my glare.  A moment passed before he answered.\n\"So what are you going to do about the chemistry between Luca and Lia when she comes back? You and I both know that Luca loved her even though you refuse to accept it. He has been finding it hard to live without her\"\nI scoffed and titled my head to the other side \"I seriously don't think that boy likes anyone. Or should I remind you that he was once obsessed with Jenny?\"\nHe narrowed his eyes to a split as he looked at me. \"So you think he would later fall in love with Jenny? No. What I think is that we can ask Jenny to manipulate Luca. His weak point had always been his weak point. By doing so. He would be content with Jenny, and when Lia comes back, I would convince her to do her duty, which is to produce children, \" I explained with a proud smile. Such a brilliant idea.\n\"I feel this is a bad plan. This might turn against you\" he persuaded.\nI rolled my eyes as I suppressed the hiss that tried to escape my lips. I rubbed my hands on my forehead for a while before I asked \"No one will know. So return his phone back\" I ordered.\nHe walked towards the door but the door opened by itself. My breath got caught in my throat at the person standing before us. It was Luca. \nHe glared at me and then at Lorenzo and gradually walked towards Lorenzo. Lorenzo's eyes widened as he moved backward.\n\"Luca..luca what are you trying to do?\" He asked fear dripping from his voice.\nLuca remained silent and kept walking toward him until he hit the wall. Luca took his phone from Lorenzo.\nFuck! I muttered as he opened the phone. He scrolled through the phone and my heart was beating faster than normal.  I fisted my trembling hands. He is not meant to have such an effect on me.\nImmediately he saw the message, his jaw tightened as he glared at me. He dropped the phone on my front.\n\"It is either you tell me who sent this, or I turn my back against the both of you, and trust me, it would not be fun,\" he growled.",

        "content": "Luca POV.\nAfter I kicked Jenny out of my room. Satisfaction filled my body. I could do as I please now. Sleep and think of Lia. I seriously wanted to message her or call her to check how she was coping without me, but because she was with her mate, so I let it be.\nI lay on my bed staring at the ceiling. Everything reminded me of her from my pillow scent that intoxicated my nostrils with her scent to how she had arranged my room last night. After shouting at me for being careless. My eyes scanned my room. I looked like a mess without her.\nThe door opened revealing one of our palace maids. I furrowed my eyebrow and she entered inside, bowing her head.\n\"What do you want?\" I asked in a sharp tone. I seriously wanted to be left alone for just a minute or two without being called or the witches visiting me.\nShe immediately knelt crying, an action that surprised me. \"Why are you on your knees? What happened\" I asked with a concerned voice.\nShe pressed her palms together to look at me. Tears rolling down her cheeks.\n\"Please don't punish me; my mother was sick, and that was why I could not clean the room this morning.\" She pleaded.\nI heaved a sigh of relief. I nodded, no wonder the room looked dirty. Although it reminded me of the way things were before she left.\n\"No problem. You can come back tomorrow\" I said.\n\"If you please, I would love to clean the room today. The Luna asked me to clean the room before she came back\"\nAt the sound of the luna, my heart melted. She still managed to order people to take care of me even in her absence. If that's what she wanted then it was okay.\nI took the key to Lia's room and left the room. \"Once you are done, knock in the room next to mine\" I instructed. She nodded and I closed the door behind her.\nI entered Lia's room and closed my eyes for a moment to allow her scent to caress me. Pain bottled up in my chest with the thought of her being with another man. Jealousy filled me; I did not want her to be with someone else and talk more about Finn. If I had my way she would be with me and me alone. \nI can't imagine life without her. I can't imagine someone taking that beautiful body or claiming her strawberry-scented lip. The reality did not just make sense to me. For a moment, just a moment I allowed myself to be mad. I allowed her laughter to smooth my skin, and sooner than later, the laughter became almost real.\nI raked my hand on my hair as a curse escaped my lips. I can't believe the fact that I could feel for someone like this. I was in pain when Jenny left but the pain I felt now could not be compared to the one I felt when Jenny left.\nWhen Jenny left, I sought comfort by sleeping outside and having a buckthorn, but I could not imagine any other girl taking my dick as she did. Could not imagine myself fitting into a hole that did not belong to her. It was as If she was made for me.\nEverything seemed destroyed: my evening rituals, my sex life, everything. I would go back to my normal routine or perhaps my new routine would be to visit Merlin and Benedicta. He saw me as a father and I have grown a bond with him. Sometimes I forget that he was not my child.\nThe maid knocked on the door drawing me back from my thoughts. Immediately she told me that she was done. I immediately walked past my room to play her Lana del Rey song. Can't imagine I am seeking solace in something I once hated.\nI entered the room and searched for my phone to play her favorite music. Anything to remind me of her. I checked my pocket for my phone but I could not find it.\nThis was strange because my phone was always in my pocket. I searched around for my phone but I could not find it.\nWhere could my phone be? But I saw it a minute before I left.\nOr was it in Lia's room? No, I went with nothing. I scattered the neatly arranged room irritation and frustration itching my skin and every part of my body.\nThen it struck me that the only person who entered my room aside from me was the maid. Could she have stolen the phone? But why would she still have the phone if she had no use for it?\nThen it dawned on me. Those twats were the ones who sent her. They had to be the one. So after the offer they still had ulterior motives.\nI marched towards their office and opened the door without knocking. Courtesy be damned.\nImmediately I opened the door. Dean's eyes widened with fear confirming my suspicion. I scanned the room with my eyes searching for my phone. My eyes landed on Lorenzo's hands. His breathing seized immediately when he saw me. He was with my phone.\nThe bloody twat had tried to steal for me. He murmured something that sounded distant to my ear.\nI took the phone from him and turned to Dean, furry blinded my eyes.\nIt is either you tell me who sent this, or I turn my back against the both of you, and trust me, it would not be fun,\" I growled.\nDean swallowed hard. \"Luca.. We need to talk. We wanted to..\" He said.\n\"We wanted to do what!?\" I asked.\n\"He wanted to talk to Lia's through you?\" Lorenzo revealed.\nI furrowed my eyebrow. \"What do you want with Lia?\" I directed the question at Dean.",

He missed me as much as I missed him. My aches from the absence of him. But what could I do? If Finn found out, he would get angry at me for even considering escaping to see my ex-lover.\nBut then again, he had no right to be angry. He left me on my first night here and eloped with a girl whom I did not know. It was already past eight. I was not used to my companion coming home late. Right from time, Benedicta came home early, Lexie came home early, and Luca found an excuse to ensure I was always with him.\nA knock interrupted my thought. Annabel came inside carrying a food tray with her. She placed it on the table before turning to me.\n\"I figured out that you would be hungry so I brought your food. If you are not okay with it you can tell me. I would ask the cook to prepare another one\" she said.\nA pleasant smile crept on my lips. Even though I had dismissed her the first instant she was trying all she could do to please me.\n\"What did you bring?\" I asked her, trying to start a conversation.\n\"Bread and avocado with egg and tea,\" she said.\n\"Nice\" I replied and walked towards the table. My tummy rumbled from the aroma that filled my nose.\n\"Come and join me\" I invited her even though I knew she would decline. She was good at declining.\nShe shook her head \"Thank you your grace but I can't\"\n\"Why?\" I inquired.\n\". Nothing is just that we are not allowed to eat with others and by the way I am not hungry,\" she said \nI shrugged and continued eating my food. \"Have you seen his grace?\" I asked.\nShe raised her eyebrow \"Do you mean the Alpha, your mate?\" She asked.\nI nodded. She swallowed hard for a while, picking her fingers. As if she was not meant to tell me where he was.\n\"He is with his cousin,\" she answered.\n\"Hmm,\" I nodded. \"His cousin? Does his cousin have a name?\" I asked.\nShe swallowed hard.d \"Her name is Bianca, \" she supplied.\nBianca? \"How are they related?\" I asked her because the last time I checked, he said his only family was his sister and her mate or was it my brain that was trying to play with my feelings?\nShe shrugged, \"I don't know.\" She said,\nShe did not know? It means he could be lying about her identity. She could be his concubine or his true love.\nA fresh needle of pain stabbed my chest at the thought of him having true love aside from me. I did not want to remain in a relationship where I was hated or seen as an ornament or a toy to occupy a position that needed to be filled. I have already had enough of being Dean's wife.\nI dropped my fork on the table and stared at her \"Do you know where they are?\" I asked, impatience flooding my voice.\n\"Yes but the Alpha said he does not want to be disturbed\"\n\"Disturbed? I am his mate Annabel, not a stranger. Take me to their position\" I ordered.\n\"I can't. I might be punished\"\nA chuckle escaped my lips. Here I was, thinking she wanted my favor. I sprang up to my feet and stood inches away from her.\n\"I like you, Annabel, and that is why I would pretend that I did not hear what you just said.it is either you take me there or you give me a location\" I ordered with a sharp tone \nA minute passed before she said, \"They are in the pool\" she said.\nGood, that was all I needed to hear: \"Take your food away. I am not hungry\" I informed her.\n\"But-\"\n\"Do as I say\"\nShe nodded and carried the food away wearing a scared face.\nI pulled out one of my Royal gowns to impose my royalty and stormed off.\nDid I know where the place was located? No, but I would find it. A pool cannot be that hard to find.\nI started asking all the maid questions. As I advanced in the direction of the pool, my heartbeat fastened. What if I caught them in an awkward position? What if he was kissing her?\nAfter a long walk, the pool came into sight. The girl sat at the edge of the swimming pool while Finn swam inside shirtless with only a boxer on.  His sister and her husband sat on the other side discussing.\nShe said something and he started laughing. A burst of genuine laughter echoed around the atmosphere.\nSo this was what he was doing. This was the important thing that he left me for. He preferred to spend time with her than with his mate, whom he left halfway.\n\"Lia\" he called immediately he noticed my presence. His eyes widened with shock. She turned to look at me with a smile. I tried to detect if she was mocking me or giving me a genuine smile.\nHe swam towards the edge, his whole body dripping with water, and his dark hair settled on his face, enhancing his look.\nHe took his towel from her and walked towards me. Worry shadowed his face.\nI took a step back, stopping him from coming closer to me. \n\"Lia I..\" He began trying to give me a silly excuse.\n\"I just wanted to know why you left early. I have seen the reason why, and I would love to go back to my room. my presence does not distract you,\" I said with a trembling, pained voice.\n\"Gosh! Lia, I ..\" he began, but I had already walked away. My heart was beating fast as tears gathered in my eyes.",

I was his mate, and there was a mate bond, but it would never be more than that. He would satisfy me in bed because he wanted to and not because of a passion.\nBy the time I got to the room, tears were already flowing down my eyes. I wiped it off before it dropped. They were not worth my tears, not a single one of them.\nI wasn't even angry with the fact that he might be cheating on me with Binaca. I was angry that he left me on my first day to go and swim with his so-called cousin. What a despicable liar.\nI took in a shaky breath as I tried to calm the anger that was welling up within me.\nI brought out my phone and reread the message again and again. If he was cheating on me I was allowed to do the same.\nI pressed the reply button and typed, \"I have missed you too, Luca. A lot. And yes, I would be free tomorrow; maybe we could meet on the outskirts of the pack. \" I reread it again and again and pressed send.\nImmediately, Finn walked into the room. He had already dried himself up. He stared at me for a while, maybe contemplating on what to say next.\n\"Lia, we need to talk,\" he said.\nI nodded using the we need to talk phrase. They used it every time they wanted to say something annoying or offer a silly excuse.\nI scoffed and tilted my head towards the wall clock on the wall making him do the same. \"It's nine o'clock. Maybe you might not remember, but I am a royalty, and we value our sleep a lot. So I am going to take my bath and sleep while you return to your friend\" I retorted.\nHis eyes darkened. \"You mean Bianca?\" He asked.\nI shrugged. \"Her name is none of my business,\" I replied.\nHe narrowed his eyes to a split, then his eyes widened. \"Are you jealous? She is my cousin. She just visited nothing is going on\"\nI glanced at him from the hollow of his shoes to his dark wet hair. Do I look that dumb or what? How on earth did he expect me to believe such a lie?\nI pressed my lips into an amused smile. \"I know,\" and walked towards the changing room.\nHe followed me inside. \"You do know that you had no right to be angry considering what you had with Luca,\" he blurted out.\nI smiled. That was his excuse. My affair with Luca. But at least he knew I had a history with Luca. I did not tell him that Luca was my cousin.\n\"Oh, I see. So you are trying to justify whatever is going  on between you and her right?\" I asked, sounding amused.\nHe glared at me for a while as he pinched the bridge of his nose. \"No. I am trying to tell you that I was not cheating on you\" \n\"And whoever said you are cheating on me because I don't remember telling you,\" I retorted.\nHe took a step backward. \"Don't take me for a fool, okay? You did not have to say it\"\n\"And don't take me for a fool either! You can't tell me nothing is going on between you and her!\"\n\"She is my cousin!\" he shouted, frustration filling his voice.\n\"Lies! \n\" Don't call me a liar, lia! I am your Alpha\" he snapped\n\"My Alpha is Dean and not you. He is the  Alpha of my pack, not you! She did not act like your cousin. You didn't introduce her to me the way you did to your sister. Instead, you left me in the presence of the staff with no explanation, and you expect me to believe that lie!\" I screamed at him.\nHe closed his eyes and pressed his hands together. \"Look, lia. I am sorry for the way I left you. Something came up, and I had to go. Don't just build an idea about me with just one act. And don't act as if you were not thinking about Luca on our way here because I know you were, and I don't blame you, but I am asking for a fresh start. I have no affair and I never had. I have been clinging on to the day I would see my mate. Did it ever cross your mind how I would feel if you were lying? Jenny was the one who approached me and told me to take my mate, who was having an affair with her mate. You were in Luca's arms while I slept, consumed by the thought of you. still, I am ready to put all these aside and start afresh,\" he implored.\nFor a moment, my heart melted at his speech. It sounded genuine. His eyes looked pure like he wanted to give me a chance.\nI nodded \"Fine, I apologize for lying to you. I am sorry\" I said.\nHe heaved a sigh of relief. \"Good. I will introduce the both of you tomorrow\" he said and pressed a kiss on my forehead before leaving.\nI smiled at him and watched him close the door, but all I could think about was what he said about Jenny. How come Jenny knew he was my mate? And how did she know I was seeing Luca?\nThankfully we are going to meet tomorrow. I am going to warn him about her. She can't be trusted.",

Why did you message Lia through me!\" I shouted, making him flinch. \nI closed my eyes for a moment as I tried to imagine the reason why he would send such a text message to Lia. She just arrived in her pack and I would not want her to get into any trouble.\n\"Sabrina said my reign is at stake\" he answers after a long pause\nI furrowed my eyebrows, glaring at him \"And how does that have to do with Lia?\" I asked.\nIf the people were having issues with his reign then it was his fault and not theirs. I knew rumours would have actually started spreading especially with the hybrid they were trying to discover.\nHe swallowed hard and sat up  staring at me \"Look man I had to do this and trust me it is for our benefit\"\nA chuckle escaped my lips. This man must think I am a fool to believe he would ever do anything to my benefit. How the hell did he think he was going to convince me?\n\"I don't care if you are doing it for yourself or for the pack or even for me what I want to know is why you want to meet Lia after she left with her mate\"\n\"Because she is still my wife. She is still the Luna of this Pack. They now see me as weak because of how I allowed Finn to take away Lia without any opposition. I had been ruling for three years before my father died. Next week makes it my fourth year and my reign is already considered unsuccessful. I have no mate, I have no Luna and I have no child. And to top this I have a hybrid that is doing all he can to ensure that I look weak. If I convince her to come back she will do it. And be my Luna and give me an heir. I need a successor. You already have Jenny\" he pleaded.\nAt the mention of his need for an heir, my mind went back to Merlin, who was still with Benedicta and did not know anything about his father. Dean would have been so happy to have him in the palace. He had always had a thing for children but that was not what drew my attention or what made my blood boil. What made my blood boil was the fact that he wanted Lia to come back and give him children. Knowing how I feel about her.\n\"And how do you want to convince her to bear this kid for you because we both know you hate her\"\nHe heaves a deep sigh as he caresses his forehead with his fingers. \"I would find a way to make her come back\" \nThe audacity of this bastard! What did he take Lia for? A breeding machine? Or some toy that they used whenever they wanted to? How the fuck did Lia land in his hands? \n\"So you  had to stoop so low to send a maid to  steal from me\" \nHe shrugged and whirled his chair around \"Would you have helped?\" He asked.\nAnger was bottled around my chest. He knew I was not going to help yet he stole the phone.\nAnger boiled within me at the thought of what he wanted to do. He wanted to take what was mine and yet minutes ago he was offering me lies in the name of truce. \nSabrina was right. The people who loved me were not here. He did not love me nor did Lorenzo love me. They just wanted to be safe with no opposition.\nI walked towards him and pulled him by his collar \"Now listen to me. Lia might be your wife but that is a title and I actually do not care about the title but she is mine. I don't give a fuck if you are her husband or not. She is mine to keep. So if you are convincing her to come back to this palace and bear children for you then be ready to kill me because I would rather drown in my blood than allow her to bed you\" I warned.\nHe tried pulling himself from me but to no avail. I finally let him go after I was sure my words had sunk deep into his head.\n\"You have Jenny,\" he muttered as I turned around.\nI whirled around to face him \"You can have Jenny for all I care but you won't lay your hands on Lia\" I warned.\nAs If on the clue, my phone beeped with a message from Lia.\n I have missed you too Luca. A lot. And yes I would be free tomorrow, maybe we could meet at the outskirts of the pack \" \nA smile shadowed my lips at the text. Part of me was grateful that she still thought about me even when she was with Finn. It meant that I was not alone in longing for her or finding her scent in everything. She still loves me.\nI was against the idea of him texting her. I didn't want her to get caught and get into Finn's bad book. He was her Alpha, he could do as he pleased.\nThat was before, but now. I would visit her to see her face for one last time.",

It seems as if he saw my facial expression.\n\"No!\" I shouted without hesitating. I looked at him and Lorenzo. \"I don't want to see you with Lia today and never,\" I warned.\nI walked towards the door, but Lorenzo stopped me, digging his fingers into mine.\n\"If we don't speak to her, you are not going to talk to her either, Luca. We are not going to let you leave Jenny alone. You have your mate and she is somebody else's mate and wife. Remember that you are a rogue, don't make me force you,\" he warned.\nI gritted my teeth as I restrained myself from doing what I was not meant to do. A chuckle escaped my lips at the thought of Lorenzo's words. You are a rogue. Don't make me force you. \nThis bloody twat. One moment ago, he was professing his need for us to work together, and now he is calling me a rogue, telling me he would keep me under leash. What the fuck did they do? \nI gripped Lorenzo's hand, squeezed it so tight that he whined from pain.\n\"Now let me warn you, you cunning twat. Neither you nor Dean can keep me under a leash. I will see Lia this evening. If you try to stop me, you are going to hate me, and if I should see any of you coming with me to see her, I would make your death look like an accident. I am done caring. I am done saying he is my cousin, or you were my best friend. I would kill you and feast on your blood,\" I warned him.\nHis jaw dropped at my threat, and a pleasing smile crept on my lips as I stared at his expression.\nHe tried twisting his hands around my grip, but it caused him more pain.\nThe door creaked open, revealing Jenny. I focused my attention on Lorenzo. Let me show him who was the boss here. I am a fucking hybrid. Their reign would be easier than they thought.\n\"Luca, I was looking for you,\" she said as she used her long nails to trail my skin. \nI tightened my grip on Lorenzo one last time before letting him go. A groan escaped him immediately.\n\"Jenny,\" I called without looking back. She stopped. \"Yes, my love\"\nI bit my tongue from rebuking her. I turned around to face her. \"What do you want?\" I asked.\nA smile tugged her lips. \"Well, I wanted to see you in person, but since the three of you are in one place, let me make my wishes known to you\"\nHer eyes darted to all of us before focusing on Dean.  \"You look lean. It seems the Alpha title is not benefiting you,\" she said.\nDean glared at her. \"Is that what you wanted to see us for?\" He asked.\n\"No,\" she said and walked towards a chair and sat down with her legs crossed. \"I actually wanted to tell you about my wedding plans,\" she said.\nWhat! We all chorused. I stared at her in disbelief. What the fuck is wrong with the people around me? Can't I just have a day without drama?\n\"you heard me. I came to discuss my marriage with you. I thought Luca had already done that,\" she said in a low voice.\nMy ear itched with irritation at hearing her speak. I had tried to fathom the reason for my change. Once upon a time. I would have done everything to hear her speak.\n\"We are not getting married,\" I said firmly. I can't imagine myself with anyone other than Lia talking more about Jenny that I found on my cousin's bed.\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"But why? You were so bent on us getting married before. What changed?\" She asked.\nOnce upon a time,\" I would have killed to have her as mine. I even threatened my uncle with his death if he did not get us married. The only reason I was not killed for treason was because I was his late brother's child. If it were to be someone else, I would be dead by now. And for what? For Jenny, who took joy in reminding me that I am a rogue and cheating on me. Unlike Lia, who always reminded me that I was a hybrid and even though I was pretending to be a rogue, I should not let them insult me and go scot-free.\nI raked my hair at the thought of her! Everything seemed upside down without her! Was she feeling the same way? Or she just wanted to see me to cut off things with me, tell me I am not worth her time. Had she given up hope for our dreams?\nFor a moment, dreams? Dread crept into my skin at the prospect of not seeing her again or finding out that she had to move on. Although I knew that I would not blame her. Finn was an Alpha after all, and I was just an unknown hybrid.\n\"Is it because of Dean's wife? She went with Finn. She did not wait for you. Let's move on, let's get married so that I can become your legally married wife. We would have kids and be happy. Is her pussy that good?\"\nAnger boiled within me at her question. I have told her to refrain from calling her a slut or even insinuating it.\nI marched towards her and gripped her with her hair. \"How many times have I told you to stop calling her a slut?\" I asked, glaring directly at her eye.\n\"You and I know that she is one. Forget her and come to me, Luca. When we get married, I will satisfy you more\"\nI glanced at her from the sole of her shoes to her hair. This woman standing here is my greatest punishment ever.\nI gripped her hand tighter. \"Now, let me make this clear. We would never get married.\" In fact, I want you gone by the end of this week. Out of my life, out of this palace. And this would be the last time you talk about Lia to me\" I warned and let go of her hair.\nI glared at the both of them, daring them to say a word. When they did not say anything. I walked away.\nMy phone beeped immediately. It was a message from Benedicta.\n\"The hybrid was here,\" it read.",

        "content": "Luca POV.\nWhat the hell! I muttered. How did the hybrid get to their house? Hope he did not harm Merlin in any way.\nI looked at the time. It was already ten O'clock. I can't be outside by this time, but I needed to know if Merlin was okay. I had made a vow to Lia that I was going to protect her son and I had to protect him. He looked up at me as a dad.\nImmediately after I closed the door, I dialed Benedicta's number. It rang twice before she picked it up.\n\"Luca\" she called in a whisper. Her voice shook with great fear.\n\"Are you okay?\" I asked. If the hybrid was still lurking around them, I would be there in a minute. My conscience would hurt me forever if anything happened to her.\n\"Yes. He almost took Merlin, but Luca, I did a spell that prevented him from entering. He has been attacking another household\" she said in a low, fearful voice.\nFear gripped my heart at the thought of Merlin. How would he feel hearing people's bone cracking? It would be a great nightmare.\nI ran my hand around my hair and pinched the bridge of her nose. \"I am so scared,\" she whispered in a trembling voice.\nFuck! I muttered. Benedicta was a great witch, almost as great as Sabrina. If she was scared, that meant it was horrific.\n\"Is that mummy?\" Merlin's little voice asked from afar.\n\"No, it's Luca,\" she said.\n\"Daddy?\" He munched, something I could not make out of.\nMy heart beat fastened at the thought of how he had named me his dad even though Lia kept telling him I was not his dad. This was why I would never get over Lia. She left her presence around me. If it was not her scent on my pillow, it was her Lana del Rey song that she downloaded on my phone, and if it was not that, it was Merlin and the times we spent together like a family.\n\"Yes,\" Benedicta answered. \"Should I give him the phone?\" She asked.\n\"Yes, I answered without hesitation. A minute later, Merlin pressed the phone against his ear as he complained to me.\n\"Dad, there is a man here. He is sort of scary. He has Golden's eyes and is lurking around. Everyone is screaming. He tried touching me, but I screamed and she saved me. I was calling my mother, but there was no answer. Do you know where she is?\" He inquired.\nThe pain was bottled around my chest. A child-like Merlin should not be made to suffer this much. Lia was meant to be with him or at least take him with her. Give some silly excuse. Anything because he wanted closure. He seemed the closure of his Mother more than anything.\nHow was I going to tell him that his mother was far away in another pack doing god knows what with her new mate?\nI wiped my face with my hand. \"Mummy is not well, and she is sleeping, but she will talk with you tomorrow morning, okay? Don't be too angry at her. When it is dawn, I will visit you,\" I promised.\n\"Okay. Goodnight\" \n\"Goodnight,\" I answered back as the line switched off.\nI fell on my bed, my eyes staring at the ceiling. How did my life become this messy?\nThe next morning came quicker than expected, maybe because my night was filled with wet dreams of Lia. As a result, I woke up with a boner.\nBut that was not what woke me up. It was the wailing and screaming of people from afar that woke me up.\nI groaned as I rolled out of bed to meet them. What the hell was wrong with them? what had happened again?\nSomeone knocked on the door and I opened it, only to see Jenny standing before me. Ordinarily, I would have shouted at her or even insulted her, but she was trembling, her skin pale with fear.\n\"Jenny, what is wrong?\" I asked.\nShe immediately engulfed me in a hug. Okay, that is kind of strange and uncalled for. But I did not say anything, instead I circled my arm around her waist.\n\"Jenny, what is wrong?\" I asked in a little sharp tone. My body was already getting irritated at her.\n\"They are so scary,\" she said.\nI furrowed my eyebrows backed myself from the hug and looked at her. \"What is so scary?\" I asked.\n\"The bodies, the hybrid. They are all scary\" \nMy heart sank at the mention of the hybrid, and my mind flashed back to my call with Merlin yesterday. \nThe bodies. The hybrid! That means he killed a lot of people. What the hell did he want? Who could this hybrid be?\n\"What bodies?\" I asked, feigning ignorance.\n\"They brought different bodies. Bodies of children and men. Some were injured and others were dead. I heard their scream from the guest room yesterday. I was really scared,\" she murmured, her body still trembling. This is the first time I have seen Jenny scared since she got back. She had been fearless.\n\"They brought some to the palace,\" she informed me.\n\"Jenny is okay. He is not going to hurt you?\" I promised, and I removed myself from her embrace.\nI walked back into my room picked a shirt and walked towards the hall.\nMy jaw dropped as I stared at the bodies. The hall was filled with people crying and weeping. What the fuck! I muttered as I stared at the bodies and blood oozing from their body. soaking the thick carpet.\nMy eyes moved to Dean and Lorenzo. Dean was sitting on his chair with Lorenzo by his side wearing a scared expression. \nA woman screamed from the crowd.\n\"Your father's reign was not like this; he managed to kill every blood of thirty hybrids. It is either you find a solution or you leave\"\n\"Do you know you are committing treason by threatening the Alpha?\". Lorenzo asked. His voice was laced with fear.\n\"Two of my kids are dead, one is badly injured. Is death worse than this?\" she asked.\n\"He killed throughout the night. He would attack and when you think he is gone, he would come back,\" one shouted.\nMy eyes moved around the bodies lying on the ground. Then, my eyes caught a bracket, the same one I had given to Merlin. It laid on the hand of one of them.",

        "content": "Lia pov.\n\"Mummy, are you ever going to leave me?\" Merlin asked.\nI shook my head as I watched him peacefully playing with his toy on the beach.\n\"You always leave me even when I am scared,\" he said.\nMy heart clenched at his words, but I had work. I had to work to give him a better life.\n\"Mer, I will never leave you. Never!\" I promised.\nA smile tugged his lips as he stared at me. He turned his attention to the toy.\nA wave of satisfaction watched me as I saw his expression. I looked at the peaceful beach, the heat of the sun hitting me, enhancing my olive skin.\nI stared at the beach with peace. My eyes caught sight of a dark figure from afar. That is strange because we were in summer. Then it increased, coming closer, and as It came closer I had a clearer view of what it was. My heart sank into the depths of my stomach. \nWe were having a tsunami. My eyes darted to my side where Merlin was, but he was not there. Dread crept into my skin as I looked for him. Then I caught him at the edge of the beach. Fetching water with his toy can.\n\"Merlin!\" I shouted, but it was already too late. The water was already close. My legs left the ground as I ran towards Merlin. The place was already deserted, and I noticed someone running behind my back.\n\"Merlin!\" I shouted as the water covered where he was. A muscular arm pulled me back from entering the river.\n\"Lia, you can't swim,\" he said. I still would recognize that voice anywhere. It was Luca.\n\"We have to save him,\" I pleaded as I rested my head on him.\n\"Mummy!\" Merlin shouted. I turned to see his little hand in the middle of the water. He raised his head once more to look at me. His blue eyes screamed fear. Then the water swallowed him.\n\"Merlin!\" I screamed, fighting hard to leave Luca's grip. Tears flowed freely as I stared at the river.\n\"Merlin!\" I shouted again.\nSomeone slapped my cheek a little, and I opened my eyes. The rays of the sun blinded me for a minute and I closed my eyes back. It dawned on me that it had been a dream.\n\"Lia\" Finn called again. I opened my eyes to meet Finn staring at me. His eyes are soft with worry.\nI stared at his blue eyes for a moment as my mind tried to read the meaning of that dream. Fear gripped me at the prospect of Merlin dying. Lord, hope he was okay? I prayed.\n\"Lia! Answer me\" Finn shouted again, his voice filled with fear.\nI nodded and sat up. \"It was a nightmare\" I answered. \nHe heaved a sigh of relief and looked at me once more. He opened his mouth to say something, nightmare, but quickly closed it again.\n\"Who is Merlin?\" He asked as I felt Huh? The color drains out of my skin.\n\"Huh,\" I asked.\n\"You kept on shouting Merlin in your sleep, and you refused to wake up. You scared me a lot,\" he said.\nI shook my head.\"I don't know who he is. He was a child in the dream\" I said. Gulit strangled me at the thought of denying my son. What would I do? He couldn't stay with me and the dream did not make it seem as if he was okay with Benedicta, although I know Benedicta would guide him with her life.\n He studied my face for a while before he looked away. He rolled out of the bed and pecked my forehead before leaving.\nImmediately after he left, my mind raced back to Merlin. Could he be in trouble? This dream was not a good one.\nI immediately picked up my phone and dialed Benedicta's number. It rang for a moment and it went into voice message.\nFear gripped me the more. Benedicta always had her phone with her. What could have been so urgent that she left her phone? In moments like this, I wished I had given Merlin a phone. I wished I had taken him with me.\nPanic rolled up with me and without wasting time I dialed Luca's number, but he did not pick up.\nFrustration welled up within me. Why was everyone not picking? What was happening? Luca was meant to pick up my call. He always had his phone with him. Could it be that something bad had happened, and that was why he left his phone?\nI picked up my phone again and called Lexie. A knock on the door stopped me. I did not want anyone to catch me or raise any suspicion.\nCome in, Daina, I entered. She wore a worried look on her face. \"\"What is wrong?\" I asked, sensing her discomfort.\n\"My Luna,\" she said in a trembling voice.\n\"What?\" I asked again, my voice lacking impatience. She was beginning to scare me.\n\"A hybrid attacked our pack yesterday. He killed many wolves at night, especially on the outskirts of the town. There is chaos as we speak. I just wanted to ask for a leave from you to check if my family is alright. They have not been picking up their calls\" she pleaded.\n\"A hybrid attack? At the outskirts of the pack?\" I asked with fear.\nShe nodded. The air within the room became too thick, and sweat gathered on my forehead. Benedicta lived on the outskirts of the town.\n\"Can I go? I promise to come back today\" she pleaded, her palms pressed together.\nI nodded and watched her leave. I picked up my phone to dial Lexie's number again when a message came from Luca \nMeet me at the outskirts of the pack today. we need to talk lia and is very urgent. Please just come and don't reply to my message. It read.\nWhat did he want to tell me that was so urgent? Was it about Merlin or who?",

I raked my hands through my hair, should I ask Daina to deliver a message to me? Would she be able to deliver it? What if Jenny saw her and got inquisitive about them?\nI stood up from the bed and entered our closet. I opened my luggage quickly, took out Merlin's photo, and caressed it a little. I  knew he missed me a lot. I have failed in every aspect of my life, as a daughter to Benedicta, as a mother to Merlin, as a lover to Luca, and as a Luna to my pack. I have not been able to stand for them when they needed someone to stand for them.\nJust then, Finn opened the door and I immediately hid the photo. I wonder how he would feel if I should tell him that I had a son for Dean. Hell! I wonder how he would react.\n\"Lia\" he called, seeing that I was not in the bedroom. I cleaned my tears and faced the mirror. I had to be strong, for Merlin's life. Sometimes I wished I was mated to an ordinary wolf and not Dean. Then I would have never fallen in love with Luca and Finn would have never been able to meet me. An Alpha of his nature hardly met with outsiders.\n\"I'm coming!\" I shouted as I rearranged my skirt removing all traces of sadness.\nImmediately I entered the room he rushed to me and cupped my cheeks.\n\"Are you okay?\" He asked. His eyes filled with genuine concern and worry that softened my heart and made me want to talk. Made me want to share my burden with him then I remembered Bianca.\nI shook my head. I can't trust him besides I have just spent a day. I don't know how he would feel.\n\"I am fine. Why are you asking? You look worried\" I said feigning innocence.\nHe raked his hair on his hair as he cursed under his breath \"A hybrid attacked your pack and killed a lot of people\"\n\"What? A hybrid? When did a hybrid enter our pack? I thought they had destroyed all of them?\" I asked, looking surprised.\nIf only he knew that I know a hybrid. That I was in love with a hybrid and that I cheated on him with not just Luca the rogue but Luca the hybrid. He would never look at me the same again.\nI patted my cheek \"Oh, my Goddess. Could something have happened to Benedicta? She had not been picking up my calls\"\nI paced around the room with Finn hopelessly looking at me. \n\"Lia I could take you to see her If that is what you want\" he proposed with a soft voice.\nI halted to look at him. Was he playing some trick with me? He was the one who said I should leave everything about my pack so what was he trying to say?\n\"You told me to forget about my pack, then why are you offering to take me there\"\nHe glanced at me from the sole of my shoes to my hair. He sucked in a deep breath and looked away with pain in his eyes.\n\"Answer me, Finn!\" I shouted.\n\"I don't know! Okay! I don't know why I am offering to take you to your pack. But Benedicta is your guardian. You visited a girl's house who you said was your best friend. I just want you to check if they are okay and then you can come back. Just see them lia but..\" He paused as I tried to decide if he was genuine or not.\n\"But what?\"\n\"Don't see Luca,lia. You are now my mate and I don't want you seeing your ex-lover or your ex-husband. You look worried that is why I am letting you go\" He said.\nGuilt welled up within me. How would he feel if he knew I texted Luca and told him that I wanted to see him? That I missed him. And I was still going to see Luca today. It was either he came to me or I went to him.\nI needed to win his trust and I know very well that going there means I get to see Luca again. He might even be with Merlin.\nI turned to look at him \"Don't worry. Benedicta will call me and if she does not I will visit my pack tomorrow\"\n\"But you look worried. Are you sure you don't want to see them?\" He asked.\nI scoffed \"Luca never let me go willingly. In fact, if you did not bring back Jenny we would not be here. And if I am being truthful I don't think he would let me go if he knew I entered his pack\" I explained.\nHis muscles tightened at the mention of Luca. So he was jealous? Finn was jealous. How would his lover or cousin react if she found out?\nI can take you with me. He would not be able to hurt you\" He offered.\nBut I shook my head. If I visited Merlin with him, he would discover my secret and besides, Merlin would keep on asking about his father and I would not want to raise any suspicion.\n\"Don't worry. I will be fine\"\nJust then my phone rang and I rushed to pick it up. Lexi's name appeared as the caller ID.\nI picked up the phone and pressed it against my ear while Finn fixed his gaze on me.\n\"Lia, a hybrid, attacked our pack,\" she said with fear.\n\"It was a bad night for the whole pack\" she added.\n\"I know. Finn just told me but are you okay? Is Benedicta and Mer okay?\" I asked.\nMy heartbeat fastened with her silence \"Yes. It attacked their house but they survived. I went there first thing this morning\" she said.\nI heaved a sigh of relief. \"Thanks to the moon goddess. I was so worried\" I said \n\"I know. Are you coming to visit him? He has been asking after you\"\n\"Yes, maybe this evening\" I informed her.",

Fuck! \nAs I moved toward the boy's dead body a guard stopped me. \"You don't touch the bodies,\" he warned.\nI scoffed and my eyes darted to Dean. He nodded telling me to leave the body. What they did not know was that it was Merlin and Lia, that gave me hope for the future. They were the ones who convinced me that I was worth any sacrifice.\nThe day Merlin called me dad I was a little bit pissed about it because he was Dean's child and I felt he was just trying to mess with my head.\nBut after I and Lia settled our differences, the word Dad bore another vision in me. Suddenly I thought I was not worthy of anything good and found myself wanting to have a kid. Someone who would call me father or give Merlin another sibling although this dream seemed far away.\n\"Let go of me!\" I shouted, drawing everyone's attention. The hall fell silent. My eyes met with Jenny and she gave me the What are you doing look.\n\"Luca, I said you should leave them alone. Their bodies have not been identified.\" Dean said.\nI curled my hand into a fist as I called on patience to stop me from doing something I did not want to do.\n\"I have someone I am looking for. And I would advise you to let me find him. Don't try to interrupt me again. You don't have a kid or even a heart to become a father so you would not know what these people are going through\" I retorted.\nDean glared at me, his veins throbbing from his head and neck. \n\"Luca I as the Alpha of this pack am asking you to leave before I do something you don't like\" he growled.\n\"Something like what? You act as if I said a lie that would stand as treason. Do you have the heart of the people?\" I asked.\nI could feel everyone's eyes on me and him. If it was an ordinary day. I would not care but it was Merlin, my son. I cared about him more than anything excluding Lia.\nLorenzo stood up and stood beside Dean. \"Luca, he is the Alpha of the pack  leave the place, and besides you are just a..\"\n\"A rogue. I know! That is why you don't seem to care about the wants of the people. I am just a rogue. There are rogues here whose children and whose loved ones were attacked. Some wolves lost their loved ones last night and you haven't even said a word or addressed them. I want to check on a body and you are threatening me. I stopped caring about your threat a long time ago. You can try to do your worst. But ensure that you kill the hybrid if not you will become an  Alpha without a pack\" I warned breathing heavily.\nDean's nostrils flared as he looked at me. Then someone from the crowd clapped and then another followed and before you would know it the whole pack was clapping for me. It stopped after a while and they started chanting my name.\nSabrina walked to me with a smile and whispered \"Benedicta and Merlin are safe. They are in my house. You can see them\" \nI stared at her with wide eyes unsure if I could trust her at this moment. She might be trying to pull me out of here.\nShe nodded \"I am serious,\" she said. \"Now turn to the crowd and bow\" she ordered.\nI furrowed my eyebrows. Why would I bow? I did it anyway. And surprisingly they bowed to me with respect. Chills ran down my spine at the sight. This has never happened to Dean.\nAs I walked towards the exit, Lorenzo grabbed my hands stopping me on track. \"Game on,\" he said with a glare.\nI immediately went into my room and got out with my car keys. Sabrina was already waiting by the door by the time I got there.\n\"The people have chosen you,\" she said immediately after we entered inside.\nI stopped in my tracks to stare at her and then turned to what I was doing before pretending not to hear her.\n\"Luca, I am sure you heard me. The people have chosen you\" she repeated.\nI bit my tongue from saying something stupid \"I heard you the last time. Now put on your seat belt and let us go. I need to see Merlin\"\nA smile tugged her lips as she wore her seat belt. \"You seem to have grown attached to this boy\"\n\"Yes. I take him as a son\" I admitted. There was no need to hide it.\n\"Good. Back to my topic. The people have chosen you. They bowed to you. It seems as if the moon goddess is in your favor\"\nI doubt I am sure I am the most highly unfavoured human being. First, my mother died at my birth. Then my father died later. My mate slept with my cousin. I found myself falling in love with my cousin's wife who had a kid for him and was a mate to an enemy pack. Can someone's life be more miserable? It has succeeded in taking my loved ones from me.\n\"What do you want, Sabrina?\" I asked.\n\"To challenge Dean. If you kill the hybrid, they will let you be their Alpha and you can take Merlin as your heir since you are getting attached to the boy\" she said.\nI glanced at her and then at the road \"I am not interested in the throne. The only person I wanted was gone. He can have the throne\"\nShe tilted her head \"That is what you would say now but time will tell\"\nI glanced at her and then at the road. What was she trying to say? I can't be the Alpha. They would not accept either a rogue or a hybrid as their Alpha.\nBut first I needed to find what the hybrid wanted and stop him or warn him not to touch the people I love.",

Everyone was at the table except him and Bianca.\nAnd when I asked where Bianca was I was told she had a business meeting. I nodded with a smile. They all seemed to be having a business meeting early in the morning.\nWhat did he say she was to him again? His cousin. His cousin, not his secretary or personal assistant so why did they attend meetings together?\nSomething was going on between them. He was cheating on me with her for sure. That was the only explanation he could give me.\nWhen his sister tried to explain on their behalf, I shunned her. I was not a fool. \nI did not care about them that much. I had a son to worry about, and I still found myself wet thinking about Luca. Even the memory of his laughter caused warmth to my heart, and nowadays, I find myself thinking about him more often than I should.\nTried to find his personality in someone who had blue eyes or average-height hair or someone who laughed or looked at me with such respect.\nFinn does not even care about me and I have accepted that in good faith. What I have not accepted is me being an ornament like I was in Dean's marriage.\nThe way I got rid of Maggie would be the same way I get rid of her. I would not only be his Luna, I would be his wife and also Luca's lover. It was time to be selfish.\nAfter breakfast, I spent a lot of time with Annabel. She seemed more friendly with me and even confessed how she usually feels when she offers to do something for me, and I refused, only to see Daina doing it.\nI had to accept the fact that I had another maid now.\nImmediately it clocked seven o'clock I made my way to the outskirts of the pack without anyone following me or informing anybody. Luca had already told me he would be waiting.\nImmediately I saw him, I ran to hug him, grateful that he had come.\n\"Are you fine?\" he asked with concern. Maybe he was surprised by the way I hugged him tightly as if I was holding on to my dear life which was true. He was my life.\n\"Yes,\" I said in a whisper. I buried my nose in his coat to take in all his intoxicating scent.\nLuca's muscles tightened for a while as I sniffed him in. \"Lia, we need to talk,\" he said as he let me go.\nI frowned. Why was he trying to be uptight around me? Has he moved on so quickly or what?.\nI sat opposite him while he bent his head avoiding my gaze.\n\"I saw Merlin today and he has been asking after you. He is no longer safe with the pack as Hybrid keeps attacking us. You need to see him and talk to him,\" he said, but all his words sounded blurry to my ears.\n\"Did you kiss her?\" I asked immediately if I was done trying. I was not going to hide my jealousy.\nHe furrows his eyebrow \"What?\" He asked with a surprised-filled tone.\nI licked my teeth with my tongue and tilted my head to the side before turning to him.\n\"Did you kiss her?\"\nLuca's eyes narrowed to a split, and he leaned backward. \"Who?\" he asked.\n\"Jenny, did you kiss her?\" I asked.\n\"No. Where is that coming from?\" He asked, seeming genuinely confused.\nI shrugged \"I don't know. Maybe you will tell me. I hugged you and you did not hug me back. Not even a peck on my forehead. No, I missed you. So I was wondering maybe you fucked her while I thought about you\"\nHe cursed under his breath \"No. You are in your mate's pack. I would not want to complicate things the more\"\n\"That did not answer my question?\" I asked in a lethal tone.\n\"No! Okay. We did not even share a room. I slept playing Lana del Rey's song because it reminded me of you. Are you happy now? Can we go back to what is at hand I would love to do what I am here for and go. I would not want you to get into Finn's trouble because I would not be here to save you, and I am afraid that if I touch you, peck your forehead, or stare at you, I would lose control and forget why I am here. That is why I did not touch you. Are you happy now? Can we proceed?\" He blurted out with pain in his voice.\nMy heart squeezed at his speech and his burning gaze on me. He was trying to stop himself from touching me so that Finn would not hurt me.\nI inhaled sharply. \"I am sorry,\" I said, even though I did not know what I was apologizing for.\n\"Don't be. Don't just let him touch you\" he ordered with so much force in his voice.\nI nodded. A moment of silence passed before I spoke \"I plan on seeing him tomorrow morning. I would ask Finn for permission to visit. Have you found the hybrid?\" I asked.\nHe shook his head sadly \"No. I am thinking of taking Merlin in to protect him. Benedicta did a spell but she is human. If she died, all her spells die with her, and we would not be able to do anything to protect him. He would never get hurt with me\"\n\"He would keep on asking about me\"\n\"I would give him an excuse. I just want him to be okay. A hybrid can't kill a hybrid\" he said.\nI nodded, thankful for the fact that he still took Merlin as his son.\n\"How is he treating you?\" He asked after a moment of silence passed.\nI shook my head. \"I think he has a Mistress,\" I said lazily.\n\"Bloody twat!\" Luca cursed.\n\"Don't worry I am fine. However, I wanted to tell you something about Jenny\" I said in a serious tone.\n\"Spill\"\n\"Jenny does not want you or Dean. She wants the throne\".",

        "content": "Lia pov\n\"She doesn't want you or Dean, she wants the throne,\" I said.\nLuca narrowed his eyes to a split \"And where is this coming from?\" He asked with a bit of impatience.\n\"That is what it looks like from the deal she made with Finn. She wants the throne,\" I explained in a pleading voice, praying that he was going to get me. \nHe glanced at me and tilted his head the other way. A chuckle escaped his lips. \"If this is about me and you I have told you that I did not touch her. We don't let our mates touch us until we don't have feelings for each other. So don't try to make Jenny look like a bad guy here. I know you don't like her, and you don't want her around me, but saying she wants the throne? It's kind of selfish\" he said in a light tone.\nAnger welled within me. I was seriously trying to save his life and all he could think about was that I was jealous. That I am being selfish.\n\"I am trying to save you, not being jealous. We have gotten over each other's jealousy. I want you to be happy. I don't want you to fall into her trap\"\nHe scanned my face for a while and took a deep breath. \"Look, Lia, I know you are worried about me, but this is not going to happen. We both know that females can't become Alphas\" he explained as he took a sip of his drink.\nFrustration boiled within me. I was trying to help him and all he wanted to do was make me look foolish. I hated the fact that he was so nonchalant about the issue.\n\"What do you want to drink?\" He asked me.\nI glared at him. \"We are not eating or drinking until we are done with this topic\"\n\"What topic lia. If it is about Jenny, it is over. I have already told you that females don't become Alpha\" he said with a hint of impatience lurking around his voice.\nI sat upright making sure he was looking at me. \" See it this way. She gets married to you, or Dean gets pregnant, kills Dean,, and claims she is carrying his child. She becomes the Alpha because Dean has an heir\"\nHe took a long sip from his milkshake. \"Dean already has an heir, which is Merlin. And she can't kill me and Dean. They don't kill royals that way. And besides I am not going to get married to her neither is Dean\"\nI curled my fist and gritted my teeth \"Merlin is not a legitimate heir. She could kill him if she gets to know and just watch sooner than later she will start asking you to marry her\"\nIt was really annoying that he was not even trying to get me or know where I was coming from. Or has she also started manipulating him as well.\n\"She has already done that,\" he said.\nI furrowed my eyebrows \"Done what?\" I asked, my heartbeat increased. Was he talking about marriage?\n\"Already asked me to marry her but I refused,\" he said nonchalantly.\nWhat annoyed me most about this whole conversation was his nonchalance. I knew he never took anything seriously except it was about me, but he should try to understand me and at least let me know that he got what I was saying. He sees her as an enemy, too, and he would do everything to make sure that she does not sit on the Attic's throne.\n\"And what did you say?\"\nHe shrugged, \"I told her no. We both know I cannot live with her\"\nI heaved a sigh of relief and leaned back into my chair, massaging my head. She was already moving faster than we thought she would.\n\"Why do you think she wants the throne and not me? Who told you that? I mean, she can't just come back from the dead and want the throne,\" he explained.\nI nodded my head \"I know. But Annabel-\n\"Who is Annabel\"\n\"My maid\" \n\"Hmm. So you think whatever she is saying is the Truth?\"\nI hit my hand lightly on the table. \"Let me talk. Stop making assumptions\" I instructed.\n\"She said during the years. Jenny used to visit Finn. They are friends. You know Finn said he would give us three days he came that same day and took me\"\n\"Hmm. I remember\"\nI nodded \"Good. It was because she told him that I was fucking you. She even gave him photos of us in the museum and got a maid from your palace who sent her a photo of us spending time together in the palace. She did that so that she could initiate Finn to take me away. If Finn took me away you would have no choice but to be with her. She is either going to kill you or stab you and make Dean make love to her and maybe kill him and don't tell me she would not be able to seduce Dean. We both know he would fuck anything that does not have a dick. Maybe she would kill you or let you leave. I don't know, but I promise you, Luca, that she did not come for good. Believe me\". I pleaded softly.\nIt would kill me if something happened to him, especially with the fact that I was not there to do anything.\n\"Are you sure about this?\" He asked.\n\"Yes,\" I nodded and showed him the photos she sent to me.\nA curse escaped his lips immediately when he saw the photos of us in the museum. We were having sex when she took the photo.\n\"This bloody twat. I will deal with her!\" He shouted, his muscles tightened with anger.\nI took his palm Into mine and gave it a soft squeeze. \"Please be careful. I don't want anything to happen to you\" I implored.\nHis gaze fell on my face. He nodded. He knew I was serious. He knew I would not be able to take it if anything happened to him.\n\"Let's talk about Merlin. I am thinking of taking him to the palace\" he said.",

        "content": "Luca POV.\nLia's face immediately grew pale with my suggestion. Her jaw dropped as she stared at me. I waited for her to say something, anything.\n\"What? I..I mean why? You can't take him to the palace. Jenny is there\" she said in a whisper, her voice laced with fear.\nI closed my eyes for a moment as I tried to explain Merlin's situation to her. I only told her about Merlin and the hybrid. I did not tell her how much conflict he caused and what Benedicta had told me.\n\"He is not safe outside the pack either. The hybrid attacked his house\"\n\"I know but Benedicta did a spell. If he comes again she would do a spell till he dies\"\n\"And if he snaps Benedicta's neck and she dies what would happen? Merlin needs the protection of somebody. You, me, Benedicta, his dad, and Lexie. He is the price. He needs all the protection we can offer,\" I explained.\nA glint of anger flashed through her eyes as she glared at me.\" You are his Dad and Benedicta can protect him. I would only agree if you give me another option\" \nI took a glance at her face, at her long lashes and beautiful freckles. \"We both know that I am not his Dad. The only option left is for you to take him with you\" I said.\nHer eyes widened \"Are you being serious? Finn would kill me for even keeping such a secret from him\"\n\"He would not care that much. He has a mistress, and besides, he keeps on asking about you every single day. He keeps on complaining telling me he wants to be with his mother. Are you waiting till he asks you if you are his mother before it dawns on you that you have been absent all his life? He needs a parent's warmth, and just so you know, Benedicta got weak; she is not fine, and do you know why? Because she spent all her energy doing spells for Merlin, and just for your information,, he attacked their house thrice lia, thrice, and Benedicta kept on doing spells. Today she might not be able to do it because of her health. What are you going to do? I visited him and all he could ask me was where his mother was. He needs his mother! He needs you\" I whisper. \nShe was seriously getting on my nerves. We both knew how life was without a mother and here she was trying to deprive him of his mother.\nMy mind flashed back to the question he asked me as I fed him cereals.\n\"Are all mothers like this? Bella has a mother, and her mother is always with her and cuddles her to sleep, but I have none except you. No one comes to my school activity. Benedicta is mostly busy. Why is my mum not coming? Does she hate me?\" He asked.\nPain squeezed my heart at his question. Not only because of that but because of how pained he sounded when asking the question. He seems frustrated and helpless. And I knew for sure that he must have tried to convince her.\nShe took in a deep breath, tears stood in her eyes. I closed my eyes as I grained. I have forgotten how soft Lia can be around me.\n\"You know it is not my fault,\" she said helplessly. \"I can't tell Dean; he does not even remember that night, and I can't tell Finn. He would not listen; he might even kill Merlin,\" she said weakly.\nI sucked in a deep breath. I hate seeing Lia like this.\n\"I know but we have to do something. I might spend a night in their house today to protect him but we have to do something. Do you know what he asked me?\"\nShe sucked in her tears \"What did he ask you?\"\nAre all mothers like this? Bella has a mother, and her mother is always with her and cuddles her to sleep, but I have none except you. No one comes to my school activity. Benedicta is mostly busy. Why is my mum not coming? Does she hate me? That was what he said\" I told her.\nHer eyes widened as her hands trembled \"Are you serious? Did he ask that question\" she asked in a trembling voice.\nI nodded. It was obvious that she was in pain but I had to tell her.\n\"Ohh, god. He must probably hate me. My child hates me. I am a failure\" she said amidst tears.\nI moved towards her and wiped her tears before engulfing her in a hug. \"I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I can't live with the idea of my child hating me\" she pleaded.\nI nodded, still patting her back. Sometimes life gives us situations without solutions. I wonder how she survived during her first year till she met me.\n\"Where were you when you met Dean?\" I asked after her sobs had subsided.\n\"At Miami. We had a party and I felt like escaping from the pack where everyone knew me as wolfless. I felt a night of music and tequila won't hurt but it ended up giving me a lifetime punishment\" she said \n\"Shh, Merlin is not a punishment. It is only looking like one because his father does not know him. If he knew you would be treated as a queen and nothing less\"\nThis was true because he was looking for an heir. He would be amazed to find out that he had a son.\n\"I would visit him tomorrow but what do we do?\" She asked me. She looked so pained and drained. Gosh! I would have kept his speech to myself.\n\"I would talk to Sabrina. Maybe she can do some spell or find out why he forgot. It is okay for you not to remember, your world was locked but he is an Alpha. He cannot get drunk\"\n\"So you think someone is behind this?\" She asked.\nI nodded \"That is my guess,\" I said.\nHer phone pepped with a notification. Color immediately drained from her skin. \"Oh my god. Finn is looking for me. He has sent men to search for you. Better get going,\" she said with so much fear and pain.",

        "content": "Luca POV\nI nodded and stood up. \"Bye\", I said, but instead, she ran toward me and claimed my lips. I halted for a while trying to fight the desire that was burning me. This place might be quiet but anyone could see us. She bit my lips and just like that. I lost every will in me. I kiss her back, claiming her, owing her, making sure she never forgot me.\nWe broke from the kiss panting heavily. \"I love you,\" she said, and once again, I felt a strange emotion in my tummy.\n\"I love you too,\" I said and watched as he made her way towards the door.\nI looked around and picked up my phone. Thankfully, no one was around, or so I thought. \nA clap from the side of the restaurant startled me. Goosebumps filled my skin. Someone saw us. Someone saw Luna kissing her ex-husband's brother.\nI turned around to meet a slender talk man. Someone I could break easily.\n\"Who would have thought that the new Luna has a lover? No wonder you booked the whole restaurant. Now I see\" he said with an amusing smile.\nHe shoved his hands into his pocket and walked towards me \"Forgive me. Are you not Dean's brother? The weak rogue\" he asked.\nI looked at my wristwatch and looked around to make sure no one saw me murdering because I would kill him and leave no trace behind or maybe burn him to avoid every hybrid mark.\nHe hit his hand on the table. \"I am sure I said something rogue,\" he said in a drained tone.\nI scoffed \"Seriously? You were talking? Forgive me; I tend to zone out when fools are talking,\" I apologized.\n\"You are rude for a rogue. Imagine what would happen if I told the Alpha that I saw his mate kissing a rogue. He would have your head for seeing her!\" He dared.\nI closed my eyes. This was why I did not want to kiss her back; this was why I just told her goodbye and left, even though everything within me wanted to take her and maybe fuck her against the table. She was no longer mine. It was a painful realization. She was Finn's mate and not mine. Not like she had ever been mine.\nThe toad moved towards me, keeping just an inch away from me. \"Imagine what he would do to you. The way he would kill you for laying your hands on his mate. I always knew something was wrong. She looked like a whore from afar\" he said.\nThat was it. That statement was what flipped my self-control and made anger rush towards me with the need to kill someone growing inside me.\nI burst into laughter, laughing at how unwise he was to do such a thing. To dare a hybrid. His face creased into a frown and my laughter increased. Seriously, I never knew people were this ugly.\"You seem to have so much faith in your Alpha\" I said, my face laced with amusement.\n\"Oh yes. He is an Alpha and not a rogue\" he boasted \nI raised an eyebrow. \"And well, I am not a rogue either,r,\" I disclosed and immediately launched toward him. I could feel my body changing, I could feel my wolf coming out.\nHis eyes widened with fear. \"You are a .. Hybrid,\" he said and attempted to run, but it was already too late. I lunched towards him and snapped his neck before sucking his blood dry.\nIt tasted good and felt so good. The hunger increased in me. To take someone, to drink another blood.\nI made my way towards the bathroom and watched my mouth off the blood. I curled my fist even though I was trying so hard to control myself. Thank the moon goddess that we met on the outskirts of the town. Before someone would visit, it would take time; besides, the pack had already put a curfew, afraid of the blood-thirsty hybrid.\nI walked out and poured the alcohol into his dead body before lighting it on fire. Without wasting time I exited through the back door and drove back to my pack.\nDuring the ride, my mind could not help but go back to Lia and the kiss and to how good blood felt. Even though I had tried to control myself I still found myself craving for more blood and more kisses.\nBefore I knew what I was doing I was playing Lana del Rey music in my car. While imaging Lia's face that managed to calm me down. It surprised me how just the memory of her calmed my nerves.\nI packed at a restaurant and called a guard to take the car home.  Then I followed a route that led to Benedicta's house. It was just seven, and everyone was afraid they had already locked themselves inside the house.\nI knocked on Benedicta's door. She opened it after checking who I was through the window.\nMy plan was to take my bath and sleep and then wait till the night when the hybrid came only for me to get there and see Sabrina sitting on the couch.\nI groaned as I cracked my neck. I was tired. \"Sabrina. What did you want?\" I asked.\nShe smiled \"I came to see Merlin,\" she said.\nI glanced around searching for the Merlin she came to see. \"It doesn't look like that because he is not here\" I retorted.\nHer smile widened to a poker's own \"Manners, Luca. Manners. Where have you been?\" She asked.\nI smacked my lips and rolled my eyes. Seriously? Since when did I get an accountability partner?\n\"I went to see Merlin's mother,\" I said.\n\"Oh, well while you were there. Jenny announced that you both are getting married, the day after tomorrow\" \n\"What? How? I mean.  Who did she tell?\" I asked.\nShe shrugged \"And Dean agreed. Do you know what that means?\" She asked.\nI shook my head, too tired to answer. \"It means that you now have official enemies. Especially with what happened this morning. People that want to see you fall\" she said.\n0094\nDean POV\n\"I told you. Didn't I? I warned you that Luca wanted your throne but you refused. He wants lia and that is all! We would have killed him when we got the chance but you refused. Now, it is almost too late! He did not only talk back at you, he had managed to convince the people that you are a bad Alpha. Now they want him, Dean! They want a rogue over us, the Royal!\"Lorenzo shouted as he kicked the chair in front of him.\nI closed my eyes for a while wondering who to believe between him and Luca. For me, Luca did not want the throne. It was evident in his face. You could see the surprise when they bowed to him. \nThat was not my business. What I wanted to know was why he seemed so interested in checking that boy's body. It was as if he had a bond with him. Could he have kids I did not know.\n\"Dean! I am talking to you\" Lorenzo shouted again disrupting my thought.\nI rolled my eyes as I used my fingers to massage my head. Sometimes, Lorenzo was a whole pack of trouble.\n\"I am listening\" I replied even though I knew that he knew I was not listening but who cares. I am listening.\n\"What do we do?\" He asked with so much anger in his voice, his eyes screaming revenge.\nI whirled my chair around for a while before turning to him with a shrug. \"I don't know\"\nHe narrowed his eyes \"What do you mean buy you don't know?\"\n\"Well, I don't know what to do. You can't change people 's minds in a whole day. They are not going to accept UA if the hybrid keeps attacking people. If we can kill the hybrid then we can talk to the people and convince them\" I explained.\nHe stared at me with defeat before he finally sat down. His hands drummed the table \"How are we going to get him?\" He asked.\nThat was a question I could not answer. How will I be able to get him? He is a hybrid. My father had made sure he had killed all the hybrids after he discovered that a part of them was planning to overthrow him. Now he could not do anything.\n\"We will keep on sending men till they kill him\".\n\" Is that the solution you have?\" He asked.\nI nodded. What's he expecting? A genius idea? I had no idea how to kill a hybrid. Something within me told me that he wanted to take my throne. Maybe he will come back for revenge for what my father did to his kind and the only way to do that was to kill people. Making me look weak.\n\"Do you know the bond between that child and Luca?\" I asked.\nHe raised an eyebrow \"How does that relate to what we are talking about?\" He asked.\nI took shaky breaths and sighs. I sighed and saw this same boy with the same bracelet on his hands and he was calling me father. At first, I thought it was a mere dream until it started repeating itself again and again.\n\"I don't know. He seemed so attached to the body\" I explained.\nLorenzo nodded and took a sip of his drink. \"That does not matter now that the boy is dead. The parents came to take him away\" he informed me.\nHe took a final gulf of drink and sat up looking at me.\n\"What do we do, Luca might become the Alpha\"\n\"He will not\"\n\"He will\"\nI hissed in annoyance. This man had a way of getting on my nerves. He had always wanted us to kill Luca one way or the other. Fond silly excuse to make sure we  killed him\n\"We can kill him accusing him of treason\" he suggested with an amused smile.\nI smile back,not at him but at his foolishness. Like what would someone decide to be this annoying? I have told him times without number that killing Luca was out of the picture. Is it either we lock him, stab him, punish him or not kill him? Like it or not he is the only cousin I had. My only family.\n\" Well he has not committed treason\" I defended.\n\"Really? Did you not see the way he talked back to you? He wanted you to appear weak that is enough treason\"\n\"Well. If we start killing people because they talked back at me everyone around me would have been dead\" I said with a sarcastic tone.\n\"He opened his mouth to talk,\" I added.\nHis eyes widened. It was as if he was trying to digest whatever I said. Trying to wrap it around his head that I had just told him he was living at my mercy.\n\"I am your Beta, Dean. Your best friend. You would cut me some slack\" he said in a weak terrified voice. \nI chuckled \"I know, you are my Beta. But you and I know that you were Luca's Best friend, not mine. You left him after what he did so don't come here telling me what to do, Who to punish and who not to punish. You and I both know that you would switch sides if anything happened to me. So do something for me. Find out who that dead boy is to Luca and find a witch that can help us locate the hybrid \"I ordered.\nHe stared at me in disbelief. Then he shoved his hands into his pocket. \" If this is what I get for my loyalty. Then okay. I would go and find a way to kill the hybrid while you sit here\" \nI nodded and waved my hands at him. Dismissing him. I was already too tired to argue with him. He knows I told him the truth.\nMy phone seeped with a notification. I clicked on it. It was a message from Jenny\n\"I have told the people. I and Luca are getting married\" she informed me.\n0095\nLia pov.\nImmediately I stepped out of the restaurant. Cold caressed my skin causing goosebumps to cloak my skin. I hugged myself tightly. I stopped for a while to stare at Luca's car. That car had brought me so many memories. I had cried in that car, had multiple orgasms, and even quarreled in that same car.\nWithout wasting much more time I went away. Making sure no one saw me, I wrapped my scarf carefully to avoid suspicion. My mouth still smells like scotch. \nFor a moment I wondered what would have happened if Luca just took me to the table there without wasting time or trying to restrain himself. I could tell that he wanted to fuck me hard from the way he looked at me with desire mixed with lust or with the way he caressed my lips after the kiss.\nAfter a while, I stopped at the center of the pack and took a cab to the palace. I wonder why Finn started looking for me. Like he had Binaca he should try to focus on her and leave me alone.\nImmediately, the gate opened, and I stepped outside. Annabel rushed to me with worry masked on her face.\n\"Annabel, what happened? You don't look okay\" I said with a hint of concern.\n\"The Alpha has been looking for you. He is so furious right now\" she informed me.\nI rolled my eyes \"Is that the reason for your fear? I will be fine\" I assured her, squeezing her shoulders lightly.\nShe nodded with a plastered smile. \"I know. It's just that he has anger issues, and he felt you were in danger,\" she said, taking my handbag from me.\nI nodded, heaving a sigh of relief. It was better than him thinking I had gone to see Luca.\n\"Do you have any free clothes?\" I asked if I needed to cover Luca: 's scent around me.\n\"Yes.\" She answered.\n\"Good. Where is he?\" I asked.\n\"In the pool. Alone\" she added with emphasis on alone.\n That was the least of my concerns right now.\n\"Get me some of your clothes. I need to change\" I informed her. She stared at me with wide eyes, I knew so many questions were running through her mind. Like, what did a royalty need maid clothes for or stuff like that, but it was not my business.\n\"What are you waiting for? Get going,\" I ordered, dismissing me.\nShe nodded with hesitation and ran away. I immediately rushed into my room and took my bath, trying to scrub off Luca's scent on me, but no matter how I did it. I could not erase his presence from my mind. His smile still caused butterflies to fill my tummy and even the imagery of his husky voice warmed my ties.\nShe brought the clothes and I put them on. I allowed it to stay on my Body for a while before I changed into my actual royal clothes and made my way to the pool. He seemed to have a swimming \nThankfully by the time I got there, no one was there. It was just me and him and his house guard. Immediately he saw me he swamped outside, worry masked his face.\n\"Where have you been? I have been searching for you\" he said.\nI gave him a polite smile. My body reacted to his touch but my heart did not. When I looked at his eyes, my stomach did not flutter, and I did not find it hard to breathe with his piercing gaze. Everything was ordinary without any emotions.\nWhy did I not get mated to Luca? It would have been an epic love story but then again, I could not be mated to him. He had a mate.\nI cleared my throat \"I went to visit Benedicta and Lexie. Lexie was slightly injured. We needed to take care of her\" I answered.\nHe heaved a sigh of relief. \"Yes, I know, but you would have told me. I could have sent some guards with you. What if they had hurt you?\" He asked with genuine concern.\nIt touched my heart. It seriously did but it was not needed.\n\"They are my pack members. They would never hurt me\" I answered.\nHe nodded. \"Yes, but that was before, but now you are the Luna of another pack. Not just another pack but an enemy who tooked their Luna,\" he said.\nWhatever he said was true. I knew that most of the pack females would hate me because I was Finn's mate but I didn't think they would hurt me. Luca would not let them touch my hair.\n\"Let's go back to our room,\" he said.\nI nodded and walked in total silence. It was only filled with stolen glances from Finn. My mind wandered around so many things like what would I do if he caught me. What excuse was I going to give tomorrow to make him allow me to visit Merlin? Did anyone see me with Luca?\n\"Why did you not tell me you were going?\" He asked again for the second time. Irritation was already building up within me.\n\" you and your secretary. Oh, sorry you and your cousin went to a business meeting. How was I meant to see you?\" I asked, my tone lacking impatience.\nHe glanced at me from the side and tilted his head to the other side. \"Nothing is going on Lia. I don't know what I would do to convince you\" he said softly, as if he was imploring me to trust him to give him a little piece of my heart.\n\"If you say so,\" I said and continued walking in utter silence.\nImmediately we entered the room I pulled my Royal gown and changed to a more suitable outfit.\nBy the time I came outside, there was a card on the table with Finn leaning on the wall beside it.\n\"What is this?\" I asked to open the invitation card.\n\"An invitation to Luca's marriage\" he informed me. Although he tried to sound normal, I could feel the hint of joy in his tone \n0096\nLuca POV.\n\"Oh, well while you were there. Jenny announced that you both are getting married, the day after tomorrow\" \n\"What? How? I mean.  Who did she tell?\" I asked anger mixed with disbelief welled up within me.\nWhat the hell is wrong with Jenny? How would you announce a marriage when the groom clearly disagrees where this is done?\n\"And Dean agreed. It means you now have so many enemies\" Sabrina informed me with delight in her voice. \nI did not blame her. She lived for the delight of war, chaos, and anything that would add importance to her presence in the pack.\nI paced around the room as I tried to wrap my head around what was happening. How the hell did Dean agree to this? Marriage was the last thing on my mind right now. I would never get married to her. I would never become Jenny's husband. She knew I had commitment issues. I sometimes like to taste a different flavour that was why we organised threesomes or a sex party. The only time my sexual desires to one person was when I was with Lia. I still find myself masturbating with just the thought of her in my mind.\nMaybe it was just a rumour Sabrina was trying to pull my legs.\n\"And how did  you hear about this information?\" I asked.\nBenedicta stood up and gave me an invitation letter with my name and hers in it. Frustration filled up within me. I raked my hand on my hair.\n\"How many people did she share this with? Is it only an important member of the pack?\" I asked. \nShe can't just print cards within a day that would curtail the whole pack. We were much.\n\"The whole pack and even the royals in another pack\nDisbelief washed through me. What the hell! What the actual fuck! How the hell did this happen? To all the royals of other packs.\nTo all Royal\nTo all Royal\nMy eyes widened with disbelief. It only meant that she must have asked them to give Finn. Lia must have seen the card. She must have seen the wedding card. Now she would think I was just trying to play with her feelings. \nHow the fuck would she feel. I fucking kissed her and now I am getting married. She would feel used.\n\"That means Lia must have found out about us,\" I said, rather than a statement.\nSabrina nodded \"She and Dean played a fast game\" \nI nodded \"A fast one\"\n\"How are the people taking it?\" I asked.\n\"Well. Some are happy about it. Others are angry. They feel you should have waited for a while before getting married to her\"\nI nodded. I took a glance at Benedicta and Sabrina. \"Where is Merlin?\" I asked.\n\"He is asleep. He slept early\" she said before asking \"What did Lia say\"\nMy heart squeezed at how Lia would react if she found out about this. She was even coming tomorrow. I would have to visit tomorrow. Make her understand me. I would never wed Jenny. Not even at death.\n\"She will be coming tomorrow,\" I said.\nI turned around and walked towards the door but Sabrina grabbed my hands. \n\"What?\" I asked shooting a death glare.\nShe smiled. \"Firstly, remove that glare. I am not the reason you are getting married and secondly, what do you plan on doing when you get there?\" She asked with a serious tone.\nI relaxed a bit trying to hide my frustration.\nI took a step backward and stared at her. \"I would make sure she revokes the plan and then asks Dean to cancel the marriage. I am not getting married to Jenny and I won't!\" I said.\nA chuckle escaped her lips. \"Is that your lame idea?\" She asked with a daring tone.\nI rolled my eyes \"Look, Sabrina. I am tired and I am not up for any game or scheming. So tell me what is on your mind and let me go\"\nShe remained silent, staring at me. Seriously speaking, if she was a younger girl and not my mother's best friend. I would have mistaken her affection and stare for love.\n\"Spill\"\n\"Do you think Jenny printed those cards in just one or two days? Did she plan it down? Does she know what she is doing? She doesn't want you or Dean. She wants the throne. I can see it\"\nI stared at her; she had told me the same words that Lia had told me.\nShe doesn't want me or Dean. She wants the throne.\nGush! This is the most frustrating",

        "content": "chapter of my life how the hell did this happen? \n\"What would you have me do?\" I asked.\nA genuine smoke shadowed her lips. \"Call the whole pack tomorrow and tell them that it is a lie. Make sure she looks manipulative to them, and then we would work on Dean recovering his memory about Merlin and Lia. He needs to know that he has a child. He is not going to have lia. You and I know who she wants. He just needs to crown him the heir apparent to the throne. By this, every other opposition dies down. Including the unknown hybrid\"\nPainful bottle around my chest. Her palm was a genius plan. A perfect plan but I would end up losing Lia. She would never be mine publicly, she would just be Dean's own. I would forever lurk around in her shadows.\nAs if on cue, Sabrina said. \"You could kill Dean and take his wife after he has made Merlin his heir. By doing so, you would have the throne, Lia, and Merlin who you have grown attached.\nI looked at Benedicta and she gave me a nod. She accepted Sabrina's suggestion.\nI turned to Sabrina. \"Thank you so much,\" I said.\nShe nodded happily. It is the first time I have had her.\nI walked out of the house with only one regret, which was the fact that I could not see Merlin. I knew that Sabrina had advised me but I was going to that house with one agenda. Either I burn Jenny or she gets out of the pack.\n0097\nDean pov.\nImmediately Lorenzo stormed off in anger after learning the truth. I called in the bodyguard who I have sent to follow Luca to give me feedback on when he went.\nHe entered inside after I had ordered him to come in. \n\"Where did he go?\" I asked without wasting time. I would pay the place a visit. I needed to see for myself what he was up to. He hardly spent time in the palace again \n\"He stopped at the outskirts of the town but I do think he outsmarted us. He came back with a cab\" he reported.\nFuck! I shouted as I mumbled a lot of curses under my breath. He knew we were following him and had decided to do otherwise.\n\"How could you be so ignorant? He was not meant to find out!\" I shouted.\nThe only grace saving this man was that he was a good soldier to the pack. If not, he would have been dead by now.\n\"I'm sorry. Your grace. Our men also saw him with Sabrina, the witch,\" he informed me.\nI nodded and waved my hands at him, dismissing him.\nImmediately, he closed the door behind him, and I leaned back into my chair. Worry trickled down my spine. Sabrina hated us, that was a fact, and if he was on Luca's side, he would eventually win us. What were they discussing again?\nA knock on the door interrupted my thought. I  groaned in frustration. They should allow me to be left alone.\n\"Come in,\" I ordered.\nJenny strolled inside with a paper in her hand and a smile that was looking so fake. I closed my eyes for a moment calling on patience to come to me.\n\"What?\" I asked. \"What do you want\"\nShe smiled and looked around the office. \"You seem to have changed your office decoration. It's a shame, I preferred the last one\"\nI gritted my teeth in anger. It was getting more difficult to control myself around annoying people \n\"Well, you died. The world does not stop because some whore passed away\"\nA glint of anger passed through her eyes. She narrowed her eyes to a split as a smile of satisfaction tugged my lips. I have successfully hurt her feelings.\nShe shook her head and squared her shoulders before sitting down. She tossed the paper to me.\nI glared at her and then the paper \"What is this?\"\n\"Open it\"\nI curled my hand into a fist \"Look if-\n\" Open it and stop blabbing,\" she said in a nonchalant tone.\nWhat the fuck. In fact, at that moment I had made up my mind that she was going to leave this palace.\nI glared at her once more before taking the paper. I took a good look at it trying to make sense of what was on it. It contained a list of gifts and cooking stuff that summed up to three million dollars.\nWhat she sought was a feast. She needed three million dollars. This was too much.\nI tossed the paper back at her. \"It's too much. If we are holding a feast, cut down the budget. Meet Lorenzo not me\"\n\"It's not a feast!\" She said,\nI raised my eyebrows. \"If it is not a feast then why would you need such an amount of money?\" I asked impatience trickling down my skin.\n\"It's for me and Luca's marriage,\" she said and brought out a card from her purse and handed it over to me.\nI stared at the card in disbelief. It had my seal and signature on it. I don't remember signing any of this.\n\"How? I mean did Luca agree? And how did you get my seal and signature?\" I was shocked by what was going on.\nShe raised a shoulder. \"Well, I would convince Luca about the wedding, and as for the seal, I stole it, and the signature, I forged it,\" she confessed.\nGosh! What have I gotten myself into? \"You just stayed for a day and you are already forging signatures?\" I asked.\n\"Yes, if I had come to you, you would have never agreed so I used another means,\" she said.\nAnger welled up within me. Irritation itched my skin. The fact that she stole the Royal seal, forged my signature, and even lied about Luca's consent made me want to kill her and rip her heart out. She was better dead than alive. I wonder what Luca saw in her that made him depressed.\nI banged my hand on the table \"Have you gone mad? This wedding is not going to be held. I do not approve of it and I never will. Tomorrow morning get out of this palace\"\nShe seemed unaffected and even stared at me in the eye. \"Is it just me or all Attic royalties are the same? They talk to the women they once fucked anyhow without any remorse. Well, for your information, I am Luca's mate, and I am not going anywhere,\" she affirmed.\nJust then, Lorenzo, together with Luca, barged into the office.\n\"Oh, Darling-\" she started but was cut off when Luca raised her with her hair. She winced in pain.\n\"Who told you we were getting married?\" He asked in a lethal voice. \n\"I don't need to. We are getting married, and you waited for me for so many years,\" she said, and Luca tightened his grip on her hair, making her wince the more.\nHe brought her face to his own bite kept two inches apart.\n\"Now you listen to me you bloody twat. I am not your mate and would never be. I Luca Attic reject you as my mate forever\"\n\"I do not accept your rejection and I will not leave,\" she said boldly.\nLuca scoffed and looked at her again. Within a split second, he brought out the white oak and drove it into her heart.\n\"You will remain trapped forever,\" he said and turned to us.\n\"I don't care what plan you had, but if you let her go, just know that I would kill you irrespective of the family bond we share, \" he said and left.\n0098\nLia pov\n\"What is this?\" I asked to open the invitation card.\n\"An invitation to Luca's marriage\" he informed me. Although he tried to sound normal, I could feel the hint of joy in his tone.\nShock cloaked my body as goosebumps filled my skin. My heart squeezed with pain as I stared at the card in disbelief.\n\"What?\" I asked my voice almost in a whisper.\n\"An invitation card to your ex-lover's wedding\" he confirmed with a mocking smile.\nI refused to pay attention to whatever he was saying. I knew he would be happy that Luca was getting married. It would make him have me all to himself. To anyone, it would be cute, seeing your mate wanting to spend time with you, but to me, it was pure torture. He was just a friend or any male friend. His smile did not give me butterflies, his gaze did not make me feel like the only person in the room, nor did his mate's scent make it uncomfortable for me to think about anything. He would never be Luca no matter what.\n\"Who gave you? I.. I mean how did you get this card? Who sent it to you? How sure are you that Luca agreed to this? There must be a mistake somewhere\" I said with a trembling voice. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Luca would not just leave me. We fucking kissed.\nA glint of anger swept through Finn's face. His jaw tightened \"Why? What makes you think that Luca would not move on? Huh?\" He asked.\nRegret swept through me. I would have never said such a word. He is my mate after all. He must be hurting inside.\n\"I did. I did not mean it that way?\" I said in a low voice.\n\"No! You meant Luca would never leave me. He would wait for me. He cannot be with his mate. I thought you said you would give us a chance. I thought you said you would get rid of Luca! I am your mate Lia! Your mate! Not your fucking toy that you lie to and give fake promises away. You don't even know what you want? You see me with Bianca, and you get jealous and mad and even try to give me some silent treatment, so imagine how I would feel if you were crying because Luca is getting married! Your ex-lover is getting married and you are crying in front of your mate!\" He shouted, his voice echoing unbounded the full room. The air around the room became warmer with his outburst, his blue eyes darkened to a stormy sea on a cold night.\nI heaved a sigh. He had every right to be angry and I must have been a fool to think Luca would love me. That he would make sacrifices for me. That he would stay away from a mate he mourned for years even while I was with him. A mate he loved so dearly that he decided to avenge her death by killing his aunt and his cousin, hell he wanted to kill me and Merlin because we were related to Dean. He wanted to kill a seven-year-old boy for a woman that died seven years ago.\nI should focus on my marriage. Focus in Finn desperately craved my trust and attention, and with time, things would get better. After all, I hated Luca when we first met.\nI turned to him. \"I was just surprised, not sad\"\nHe glared at me and took a step back, his fist still in his pocket. He strolled around the room twice.\n\"Surprised huh?\" He asked.\nI nodded with dread. His actions were becoming creepy. What was he planning to do?\nHe walked around again before he stopped in front of me. His breathing increased; he pointed a finger at me as if to warn me, then curled it into a fist and dropped it. His whole body trembled with anger. He opened his mouth to say something and closed it again. He was trying so hard to control his anger.\n\" Oh please, Lia, cut that crap. Who the hell do you want to deceive, huh? Is it me or someone else? Because you can't tell me? I don't know the difference between surprised people and those that are sad. Surprised people don't cry, their hands don't tremble because they received news that their boyfriend was getting married!\" He shouted his veins throbbing out of his head.\n\"I am not lying Finn. It came as a surprise. I would agree that a bit of me was sad but you have to understand. I am human, I have feelings. I was dating his boy just three days ago and now he is getting married to someone else. It feels so annoying and painful. I feel used\" I explained. He had to understand me.\nAlthough I still couldn't understand what was going on. We kissed some hours ago and now I am getting an invitation to his marriage. My mind flashed back to how he resisted kissing me back. How I was the one who imitated the kiss because I thought he was missing me but still wanted me to be saved. \nThe realization crept into my brain slowly, piece by piece. All the moment he had rejected me in anger.\nI could get anyone to sleep with me. \nDon't mistake my kindness for love.\nAnd then the way he denied any ill allegations when I asked him why he did not kiss me back.\nI am used to it. Perfectly used. All those moments were pretense. They did not mean anything to him. Maybe he wanted to get into me, make me trust him, and then hurt Merlin. \nFear gripped me as I thought about Merlin, could he be the one lurking as the hybrid? Could he be the bloodthirsty hybrid?\nA chuckle escaped my lips. The mistake he made was thinking I would not get back at him for what he did. First I would get Merlin out of the place and then kill him and Jenny\nI turned to Finn. \" I trust you and I want you,\" I told him.\nHe raised an eyebrow and glanced at me unsure of what to believe.\nI stepped close to him only an inch apart.\n\"I know you don't trust me but let me prove it to you. Let's get married\" I said.\n0099\nLuca POV\nImmediately I stepped out of Dean's office I went straight towards my room and locked my door tightly behind me. I could feel my eyes changing, my fur coming up. The hunger from before had returned. I closed my eyes as I tried to control my desires. I can't harm anyone and I was a good hybrid, not a bad one, not a bloodthirsty one.\nMaybe I should call Lia. She would be able to smother me. I called the first time but she did not pick up.\nFear gripped me. Was she angry with me? Did she believe what the invitation card said to her? Was she going to leave me again or for the final time? Had Jenny succeeded in tricking both of us\nI called her again but she did not pick up. The second time. Lia always picked up her calls immediately after you called her. She was always on her phone either playing her Lana del Rey song or watching an erotic movie. \nWhat are the chances that she is snubbing me? I texted her.\nPlease pick up my call. I have to explain everything to you. \nShe read it, and for a moment, I saw her typing back. My heartbeat increased in anticipation. What was going to be her response? Anyway, I was going to explain to her and she would understand. We loved each other, we can't live without one another.\nShe sent me a text message with three simple words that flipped my mood upside down.\" fuck you, Luca\" \nNo, no. It can't be. What sound do I say to make her believe me? I started texting back when a notification popped up.\nThis contact blocked you\nFuck! Fuck! Fuck! What the hell just happened? I reread it to be sure of what I was seeing. She blocked me. She Fucking blocked me without waiting for an explanation. Sometimes it felt as if she did not trust me.\nThis felt as if she was ending what we shared. As if she was letting me know that I meant nothing to her. Absolutely nothing. Felt as if she was ending this",

I lay down on my bed completely exhausted as I tried to sleep.\nInstead, the weather decided to be against me tonight. Rain poured heavily and it came with thunderstorms.\nI closed my eyes and pressed my ears together as I tried to stop the sound from entering my brain and stirring up my haunted memories.\nRegret filled me. I would have killed Jenny as soon as she arrived. If I had done so, she would not have been able to destroy my relationship. I was a fool, a big one. I always managed to hurt the people I cared about.\nThe thunder blast came so loud that I felt it was directed at my window. I closed my eyes and curled my hand into a fist as I tried to block the degrading voice that filled my head.\n\"It was a mistake, father,\" I apologized, blood dripping from my lips.\n\"A  mistake? You killed someone and you call it a mistake. Do you know what they would do to you if they found out? They will kill you!\" My father whispered.\nI swallowed hard, trying to stop the tears that threatened to flow.\n\"I did not know. Besides, he bit me and I did not die. I am a rogue and he is a full wolf. How come I could kill him?\" I asked my father.\n\"Because you are cursed. You are a mistake!\" He shouted slowly.\nPain bottles around my chest, sending Adrenaline down my body. Did my father just call me a mistake?\n\"Father! He insulted me. He called me a useless rogue\" I shouted back. \nHe scoffed and bent to my height since he was taller than me. His lips came close to my ear.\n\"For the record. You are useless and a mistake. All you do is hurt those who care about your disdainful existence. You killed your mother while coming to this world. You are just thirteen and you have killed your best friend, the only one who appreciated your unwanted presence. I should never have had you. I should have let your mother abort you. At least she would be alive and not dead,\" he said and raised his head to look at me. His green eyes filled with disgust and disdain.\nHe straightened up and took two steps backward, my body still trembling at what he just told me. All my life, I had tried my best to satisfy him, but to no avail, and to make matters worse, he never wanted me.\n\"Now go and bring a lighter. Let's burn this body before anyone sees it,\" he ordered, his voice filled with irritation.\nI stood there staring at him. I wanted him to tell me he was sorry and that he would not do such a thing. Explain to me how my bite could kill a fellow wolf. Instead, he tilted his head asking me to leave.\nWe burnt his body at night. I stood there watching the fire burn and the only words that could come to me was that I was useless and I hurt the people I loved.\nMy phone's ringing tone disrupted my thoughts. I opened my eyes to see my knuckles filled with blood and a cracked wall. I have been hitting the wall.\nIt was Benedicta. I picked it up and walked toward my wardrobe where I kept my first aid box.\n\"Hello\"\n\"Luca, it is me, Benedicta,\" she said in a trembling whisper.\n\"I know,\" I answered.\n\"Okay. The hybrid has come out again and is lurking around our neighborhood. Merlin is sick like he is shivering, and so am I. Can you come? So that he won't attack us. Please. I beg you\" she pleaded.\n\"I will be on my way,\" I said and stood up, wrapped the bandage around my hand, and walked toward the car pack.\n0100\nLia pov\n\"What?\" Finn asked, his voice filled with uncertainty.\nI crossed my ar around my chest \"You heard me. Let's get married\" I repeated.\nHis eyes widened with shock. Of course, he had not been expecting me to make such a proposal.\n\"Are you being serious?\" He asked, his voice masked with disbelief.\nI nodded and walked toward him, pointing a finger at his chest. \"Of course I am. I have never been this sure of something\"\nHe stared at me for a while and tilted his head to the other side. A mischievous grin shadowed my face. I would show Luca that two can play a game. He did not get to trick me and have a peaceful life ahead of him. It was never going to happen. I would get married to Finn and send men to kill Jenny and him but I would kill Jenny first so that he can soak into the grief of losing a mate.\n\"Are you doing this to get back at Luca? Because if that is what you are trying to do, I am not up for your silly game,\" he warned.\nA smile tugged my lips. \"Why are you bringing Luca into this? I want to get married to you and become Luna. It is time I start performing my duty as a Luna. And also I need to assure you that I have gotten over Luca\"\n\"You can assure me by other means, not marriage. You do not forget someone because you want to get married to them\" he said.\n\"That is where you are mistaken dear husband, I am getting married to you because you are my mate and an Alpha. An Alpha needs his mate beside him at all times. Except you have someone else in mind?\" I asked in a teasing tone.\nHe pinned me with his gaze \"And what does that mean.\"\n\"You know what it means. Maybe you are in love with someone else, and you want to get married to that person,\" I said.\nThis way he would want to get married to me to prove me wrong. I would rub it in Bianca's face when I see her. \n\"Fine but on one condition,\" he said.\nI sucked in my breath. Why the hell was he giving me a condition? We were normally going to get married. What is the need for terms and conditions?\n\"We will get married in three days. That way, you don't get to change your mind,\" he said.\nConfusion filled me. What the hell did he mean by three days? I can't plan a wedding in three days.\n\"What? Why three days? Who plans a wedding in three days? I have to invite my family and friends from another pack, I need a gown and decorations. Everything can't happen in three days\" I reasoned.\n\"I have enough people to take care of that. Three days or no marriage till I decide\"\nI raised my eyebrows, he was trying to stop the marriage so that he would continue flirting around with his fake cousin. \n\"Fine. I will visit my family tomorrow\" I said.\nHis eyes widened in disbelief. \"You agree to a three-day wedding?\" He asked Uncertain filled his voice.\nI nodded \"Yes. Do well to tell Binca about it\" I said and walked away before he could say anything.\nThe next morning came quicker than expected. Maybe because I spent half of the night turning around trying to find sleep and push Luca from my mind whose kisses still clouded my thoughts. I wondered how he would react to such news. Happy or sad. Well given the fact that he was getting married. I am sure we would be happy for one another.\nBy the time I woke up, Finn was gone. Maybe he went to tell Bianca that we would be getting married.\nI rolled out of the bed. Washed my face and put on my yoga pants as I settled to begin my new morning routine. It would be entirely different from the one in the other pack.\nAfter doing thirty minutes of yoga, I stood up, took my bath, dried my hair, applied my perfect makeup, and put on my blue trousers and blue handless top.\nI walked toward the dining table expecting to see everyone except Finn and Binance but to my surprise, they were both seated there. He smiled at me as I said a gesture I found creepy.\nSooner than later the servants began to serve breakfast. We had bread, meat, and avocado with coffee.\nWe were in silence for a while before he broke it. \n\"I have an announcement to make,\" he said and everyone stopped eating, dropping their cutlery. I followed suit.\nA smile tugged my lips as I  waited for him to announce our engagement.\n\"The Attics Pack had called to inform us that there would be no wedding again,\" he said and fixed his gaze on me.\nMy jaw dropped at this revelation. Why would they cancel the wedding? I thought they wanted it. Could it be that Luca did not know about the wedding or what? Something had to be wrong somewhere.\n\"Lia, are you okay?\" He asked with faked concern.\nI nodded with a smile. \"Were the reasons given?\" I asked.\nHe shook his head. \"No, but rumor has it that the groom was not aware of the wedding, and when he discovered. He called off the wedding,\" he said.\n\"That is bullshit how would the Luca call of a wedding like that. Does he know how much Jenny wants him? She would kill for him\" Bianca said.\nI raised my eyebrows as I looked at her. \"For someone who claimed to be a visitor you seem acquainted with Luca's resurrected mate. Tell me, Binaca. Is there something I need to know?\" I asked.\n\"I would tell you if it-\" she began but Finn cut her off.\n\"With that being said, I would love to announce to you that Lia and I will be getting married,\" he informed, and the table fell silent.\n0101\nLia pov\n\"What!\" Binaca asked. She was the first to break the peaceful moment of silence.\nShe glared at Finn. \"What did you just say?\" She asked.\nHe swallowed hard as he stared at her. His eyes softened for a moment before he masked it with his usual wall face.\n\"You heard me. We would be getting married\" he said.\n\"When was this decided?\" She asked.\nI gripped my knife restraining myself from stabbing her. In our pack, if you killed someone you would be killed. I am new here, so I don't know about the laws of this pack, but I am a Royal. The future Luna of this pack killing someone would not amount to death. \nI would ask Annabel later. I needed to know if I would be safe or if I should order one of the guards to do the job.\n\"Yesterday\" he answered with finality in his voice and went back to his food. It was clear that he was uncomfortable and wanted this discussion to be over. But the bitch refused.\n\"Yesterday? Finn yesterday you were in the library with me and after that you went shopping then you came back looking for her. When did you make such a decision!?\" She shouted.\nI raised my eyebrows and turned to Finn who appeared to be stuck in his food. It was as if he did not know what to say. I thought he said he had a meeting. Wow, so visiting the library was tagged as a meeting.\n\"Finn! I am talking to you!\" She shouted again. The servants widened their eyes in surprise.\nThis was becoming interesting. \"Bianca\" Finn's sister called in a pleading voice.\nBut she raised her hands in the air signaling her to stop talking. \"Stay out of this, Finn, I am talking to you.\"\nFinn took a shaky breath and dropped his cutlery. He turned to her with a glare.\n\"Firstly I do not appreciate you shouting at me. You are not my mate or my sister. You are a distant cousin who should know her boundaries. Secondly, when the decision was taken is none of your fucking business. We decided whether you live by it or you go back to the pack where you are coming from, and thirdly, this could be the first and last time you question me in front of everyone. And just so you know the marriage is happening in three days. If you can't bear to see me and my mate happy, you can get the hell out of the palace\" he blurted.\nSilence fell on the table again. Her eyes filled with tears. Finn focused on his food, avoiding her gaze.\n\"Three what?\" She asked.\n\"I don't appreciate repeating myself,\" he answered curtly.\nShe excused herself and walked away leaving the table.\n\"I have delivered the message to Dean,\" he said after she left.\nI nodded \"Thank you. That was so thoughtful of you\" I said with a smile. She said he was disappointed at my reaction and he did not show it.\nThe others continued eating, no one tried congratulating me, not even his sister. It was evident that they did not want me in the pack. His sister had been pretending all this while.\nI stood up and walked away. My appetite had disappeared. I called Diana to follow me to my pack.\nI had to see my son and see Benedicta's advice.\nThe drive to the pack was a silent one. Diana stole glances at me. She must have heard the news about this morning's quarrel from the servants. Nothing spreads faster than gossip.\nImmediately we stopped at Benedicta's house. My heartbeat increased, and beads of sweat surrounded my head even though the air can was on.\n\"It would be okay, \"Diana assured me as she gave my hand a light squeeze.\nI nodded with a smile. To her, breaking the news to Benedicta would be the most disturbing thing, but I did not think so. The most disturbing event would be if Luca or Sabrina was there. They would immediately convince me out of the marriage plot.\nI had been angry at Luca all night long only for me to hear that he never knew about the marriage and that he had called it off. It did not take a soothsayer to tell me that it had all been Jenny's plan and I had made a rash decision out of anger.\nI smiled at her and told her to wait for me while I talked to her. She nodded with understanding.\nI walked toward the house and knocked on the door. After knocking twice she opened.\n\"Lia! Is something wrong? Are you okay?\" She asked with concern and filled her voice.\nI nodded and closed the door behind her. \"I came to see Merlin and to also tell you something important,\" I said.\nShe nodded and whipped her wet hand on her cloth. \"Okay. Lexie took Merlin for check up and would soon be back\" she said and gestured for me to sit down.\n\"If it is about Luca's wedding they have called it off. When I got the invitation I was so surprised. Unknowing to me. He did not know about it. He was unaware. I knew it, I knew Luca could not just get married to someone like that. He loves you\" she said.\nMy heart sank deeper. How would she react if she heard about my wedding?\nA bang on the door started us. She stood up and went to answer it while I sat down. The bang came again. Immediately, she opened the door, and my heart stopped beating. The familiar scent filled the air. I was sure he was the one.\n\"I heard Lia is here,\" he said and walked past her.\nI bent my head in defeat. \"Lia, tell me, is not true?\" He asked, his voice filled with pain.\n\"What is not true?\" Benedicta asked.\n\"Tell me it is not true!\" He shouted but I remained silent. \"Are you getting married to Finn?\" He asked with a trembling voice.\nI nodded, too sad to look at him.\n0102\nLia's POV:\nI couldn't bring myself to look him in the eye. Instead, I kept my gaze fixed on the floor, the silence stretching painfully between us. The air felt thick, and every second felt like a thousand tiny cuts slicing through my resolve.\n\"Lia,\" he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper, \"you're actually doing this?\"\nMy throat tightened. The words felt impossible, tangled up with every bit of anger and hurt that had brought me to this moment. I wanted to be strong. I wanted to look him in the eye and say it with conviction, but the truth was, my heart was rebelling. And I wasn't sure I had it in me to face him.\n\"Yes, Luca. I am.\"\nBenedicta gasped softly behind me, her hand going to her mouth. She knew how much I had once loved Luca, how he had been my everything. But she also knew what I had endured-how his loyalty to me had faltered, how he'd left me in a darkness I had barely crawled out of.\nLuca's face twisted with pain, his fists clenched at his sides. \"So, this is revenge?\" he asked. \"You're marrying him to hurt me?\"\nI wanted to scream that it wasn't, that I had every right to seek my happiness. But my chest felt tight, emotions warring inside me. \"It's not about you, Luca. It's about me moving forward. Finding my place and my purpose.\"\nHe took a step closer, his intense gaze locked onto mine. \"And you think Finn is going to give you that? You think he's capable of loving you the way you deserve?\"\nI swallowed hard, feeling my defenses crumble. \"He may not be perfect, but he respects me. He's willing to stand beside me, not leave me questioning every step of the way.\"\nLuca's jaw tightened, his eyes flashing with anger and sorrow. \"I made mistakes, Lia. I know that. But I never stopped loving you, not for a single day.\"\n\"Then why did you let Jenny's schemes come between us? Why didn't you fight for me?\" My voice cracked, the hurt slipping out despite myself. I had tried to bury it, but here it was, surfacing in all its rawness.\nHe exhaled slowly, his shoulders dropping as the fire in his eyes softened. \"I thought I was protecting you. I thought... keeping you away from the mess Jenny had created was for the best.\"\n\"And look where that left us,\" I replied, bitterness coloring my tone. \"I was ready to fight for us, Luca. I was ready to stand by you, no matter what. But you left me out there, alone, with nothing but broken promises.\"\nThe room felt colder and quieter as if even the walls were absorbing our pain.\nBenedicta cleared her throat, her voice was soft but steady. \"Maybe it's best if we all take a moment. Clearly, there's a lot unresolved here.\"\nBut Luca didn't back down. He took another step forward, his gaze unwavering. \"If you go through with this marriage, Lia, I won't be able to just watch from the sidelines. I'm telling you now-I won't give up.\"\nMy heart raced, a storm of emotions swirling within me. I wanted to hate him for everything he had put me through. I wanted to be strong and move forward with my life, just as I had decided. But his words-they stirred something I had buried, a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, he still cared.\n\"I can't change what's already been decided,\" I whispered, though even I could hear the doubt in my own voice.\nLuca's gaze softened. \"It doesn't have to be this way, Lia. You don't have to marry him just to make a point. Come back to me, and we'll start over. We can fix this.\"\nI took a shaky breath, torn between the past we'd shared and the uncertain future I was creating for myself. Part of me yearned to believe him, to give him one last chance. But the other part, the part that had been scarred and hurt, wasn't so quick to forgive.\nJust then, the door swung open, and Finn strode in, his expression darkening the moment he saw Luca standing close to me. \"What's going on here?\" he demanded, his voice a low, dangerous rumble.\nLuca straightened, meeting Finn's glare with equal intensity. \"I was just having a conversation with Lia.\"\nFinn's lips twisted into a sneer. \"That's enough. Whatever you think you have with her, it's over. She's made her choice. She's marrying me.\"\nLuca's eyes narrowed, defiance flaring within them. \"I don't think you understand. Lia isn't some possession you can just claim. She has her own mind, and if she chooses to walk away from you, there's nothing you can do about it.\"\nThe tension between them grew, the two alphas practically vibrating with unspoken aggression. I could feel it in the air-the rivalry, the desire to prove themselves. But I wasn't some prize to be fought over. I was done being torn between them, a pawn in their power struggle.\n\"Enough,\" I said, my voice surprisingly calm despite the storm inside me. \"Both of you, stop this.\"\nThey turned to look at me, each waiting for my next words, as if I held the power to end this feud once and for all.\n\"I made my choice,\" I continued. \"Finn and I are getting married. It's not a decision I took lightly, and it's not one I'll change because of unresolved feelings or old wounds.\"\nFinn's gaze softened as he reached out, gently taking my hand. \"You heard her, Luca. It's time you accept it.\"\nLuca's jaw clenched, his eyes filled with unshed pain. For a moment, I saw the vulnerability in him-the boy I had once fallen in love with, the boy who had once been my everything. But that boy was gone, replaced by a man who had let me down one too many times.\nHe took a step back, nodding slightly. \"If this is really what you want, Lia then I'll respect your decision.\" His voice was barely a whisper, and I knew that surrender had cost him more than he wanted to admit.\nAs he turned to leave, a part of me wanted to call out, to stop him. But I didn't. I couldn't. This was the choice I had made, and I had to see it through, even if it meant letting go of the past we had once shared.\nThe door closed behind him, and the silence that followed was heavy and suffocating. I glanced at Finn, who gave me a reassuring smile, but it did little to ease the ache in my heart. I had chosen a path, one that would lead me away from the man I had once loved. But at that moment, a part of me wondered if I had truly made the right choice.\n0103\nLia's POV \nThe drive back to Finn's pack was tense and silent. Every bump on the road felt like a reminder of the conversation I'd had with Luca. The look in his eyes haunted me, as did the uncertainty that still clawed at my heart. Yet, here I was, making this choice. Choosing Finn.\nAs the car pulled up to the grand stone entrance of Finn's estate, I took a deep breath, steadying myself. We stepped out of the car, and before I could fully gather my thoughts, I turned to Finn, unable to contain my frustration.\n\"Why did you follow me?\" I asked the edge in my voice surprising even me. \"I don't remember telling you to tail me.\"\nFinn raised an eyebrow, his expression hardening as he looked at me. \"I have to know you're serious about this, Lia. I'm not about to let myself get played.\" His tone was calm but firm, his words hitting a nerve.\nI folded my arms, narrowing my gaze at him. \"You think I'm playing games?\" I shot back, feeling a mix of indignation and something else-something more vulnerable, though I'd never admit it. \"If I didn't want this, I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't be doing any of this.\"\nHe sighed, the tension on his face momentarily easing. \"Maybe. But I need to be sure. And you haven't exactly made that easy.\"\nJust as the words left his mouth, I caught a movement out of the corner of my eye. Myles was standing by the main entrance, watching us with a curious yet unreadable expression. I could only imagine what he thought, witnessing us throwing daggers at each other with our eyes. I glanced upward and saw Finn's sister standing on the balcony, her gaze piercing and calculating as she watched the exchange between Finn and me. A chill ran through me, though I couldn't tell if it was from the cool evening air or something else entirely.\nFinn's voice brought me back. \"I need to be certain, Lia,\" he said, his tone softer now. \"I can't afford to get this wrong. Not again.\"\nI looked away, staring at the grand archway that led into the house. The doubts I'd buried were surfacing, threatening to pull me under. He didn't trust me-not completely, anyway. And why would he? Our whole situation was built on fragile ground, held together by decisions I couldn't quite understand myself.\n\"Fine,\" I replied, exhaling slowly. \"But maybe next time, don't sneak around and follow me. If you want to know something, ask.\" I hesitated, my gaze hardening as I met his eyes again. \"And while we're on the subject, going to the library with your cousin? That's suspicious. Maybe next time I'd like to tag along.\"\nFinn's face went blank, and he didn't respond. He just held my gaze, his expression as unreadable as ever. After a long, tense silence, he simply turned and walked away, leaving me standing there, the unspoken words between us feeling heavier than ever.\nI watched him go, feeling a strange emptiness settle over me. The desire to trust him, to believe in the life I was trying to build here, clashed with the nagging voice in the back of my mind that reminded me of everything we'd both been through. We were bound by necessity, by choices that had already been made, but was that enough?\nAs I walked into the house, my gaze drifted around the hall, its grand yet cold beauty somehow mirroring the unease within me. The ache in my heart grew sharper as I thought of my son, the one person who had given my life meaning through all the chaos. Being here, trapped in this confusing situation, away from him-it was more painful than I'd imagined.\nI forced myself to hold my head high as I moved through the house, even though I was painfully aware of the eyes following me, the silent judgment from Finn's family, his pack, even from Myles and his sister. To them, I was an outsider. A stranger with questionable motives.\nAnd yet, I'd made my choice. I'd decided to be here, and tomorrow tomorrow I would make sure I saw my son, no matter what it took.\nLater that evening, as I wandered through the vast, empty halls, I found myself drawn to the small parlor at the end of the corridor. The room was quiet and dimly lit, the flickering light of a single candle casting soft shadows on the walls. I sank into the armchair by the window, allowing myself a moment to breathe, to feel the emotions I'd been bottling up all day.\nI closed my eyes, imagining my son's face, his laughter, the warmth of his tiny hands in mine. My chest tightened, a tear slipping down my cheek before I could stop it. I'd missed him more than I could bear, and being here, in this unfamiliar place, made that ache all the more unbearable.\nThe soft click of a door opening made me look up, and I quickly brushed away the tear. Finn's sister entered, her expression unreadable as she took a few steps into the room.\n\"Lia, isn't it?\" she asked, her voice cool, yet oddly polite.\nI nodded, studying her carefully. She was beautiful, her features sharp and elegant, with the same piercing eyes as her brother. I could tell she was assessing me, and I met her gaze steadily, refusing to show any hint of vulnerability.\n\"Welcome,\" she said after a pause. \"I suppose I should officially greet you, seeing as you're Finn's guest.\" The way she said it, with a slight hint of hesitation, made me realize she wasn't quite sure how to define my presence here.\n\"Thank you,\" I replied, keeping my voice steady. \"I appreciate it.\"\nShe offered a small, almost reluctant smile. \"I hope you find your time here worthwhile,\" she said, her words carefully chosen. \"Our family isn't accustomed to outsiders, as I'm sure you've noticed. It takes time to build trust.\"\nI nodded, understanding the unspoken message. She was warning me, in her own way, to tread carefully, to be mindful of the delicate balance in this place.\n\"I understand,\" I said quietly, meeting her gaze with as much confidence as I could muster. \"I'm not here to disrupt anything. I just want to build a life, a place for myself and\" My voice trailed off as I hesitated, not wanting to reveal too much.\nShe seemed to notice, her eyes softening slightly. \"Your son,\" she murmured, her tone surprisingly gentle. \"I can only imagine how hard it must be to be away from him.\"\nThe kindness in her words took me off guard, and for a moment, I felt a flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, there was someone in this place who understood, who might support me.\n\"Yes,\" I whispered, unable to hold back the emotion in my voice. \"It's it's difficult.\"\nShe nodded, a hint of sympathy in her gaze. \"Well, if there's anything you need, don't hesitate to ask. And good luck, Lia.\" With that, she turned and walked out of the room, leaving me alone once more.\nI stared at the closed door, her words echoing in my mind. \"Good luck, Lia.\" The warmth in her tone had been unexpected, a rare kindness in this cold, unfamiliar world. Maybe, against all odds, I'd find a way to belong here. Maybe, in time, I'd be able to carve out a place where I could feel safe, where I could be myself.\nAnd tomorrow tomorrow, I would see my son.\n104\nBianca's POV\nI took a deep breath as I stood outside Jenny's door, the soft sound of muffled sobs reaching my ears. My chest tightened. Jenny didn't cry often. She was the strong one, the one who would always find something sarcastic to say even in the darkest times. But now, hearing her like this, it was as though a cold hand had wrapped around my heart. I pushed the door open gently.\nThe sight of her sitting on the edge of her bed, hair falling in wild waves around her face, eyes puffy and red, made my stomach churn. She didn't even look up when I walked in, just kept staring down at her hands clenched in her lap. It was like the life had been drained out of her.\n\"Jenny?\" I said softly, crossing the room to sit beside her. The mattress dipped under my weight, and she finally turned her head, eyes brimming with fresh tears.\n\"You know, don't you?\" she whispered, her voice hoarse and broken.\nI nodded slowly. \"Yeah. Luca rejected the marriage.\"\nThe silence that followed was thick, both of us lost in the implications of those words. Jenny took a shuddering breath and wiped at her face, but it did nothing to hide the anguish etched into her features.\n\"Why would he do that?\" she asked, her voice cracking. \"What reason could he possibly have, Bianca?\"\nI reached out and took her trembling hand in mine. The warmth of her palm felt fragile like it could shatter at any moment. \"I don't know, Jenny. But we have to find out. There's something we're not seeing here.\"\nShe nodded slowly as if each movement took all the energy she had left. Her gaze shifted, searching my face for reassurance, for some sort of stability to cling to.\n\"I can't stop thinking about everything we've been through,\" she muttered. \"I thought we knew where we stood with him, that all of this had a reason.\" She let out a bitter laugh, almost a bark. \"Turns out I was wrong.\"\n\"I wish I could say you weren't,\" I whispered. The frustration in me bubbled up, pushing against my chest. I needed to tell her the rest, the thing that had been gnawing at me ever since I heard. \"And there's something else.\"\nShe frowned, a glimmer of worry flashing in her eyes. \"What?\"\n\"Finn and Lia,\" I said, my throat tightening around the words. \"They're getting married.\"\nJenny's eyes widened in shock, the pain momentarily eclipsed by surprise. She shook her head as if trying to make sense of it. \"What? Finn and Lia? How-when did this happen?\"\n\"I don't know,\" I admitted, feeling my own disbelief knotting with anger. \"But it's real. I can't believe it either, Jenny. It feels like everything's spiraling out of control.\"\nShe leaned back, pressing her palms to her eyes. \"We can't just let this happen,\" she said, her voice gaining a thread of strength. \"We have to do something about it.\"\nA determined silence settled over the room. The quiet between us now felt different, heavier with a shared purpose. Jenny dropped her hands from her face and grabbed her phone from the nightstand. I watched as she swiped through her contacts, her fingers moving with new resolve.\n\"I need to talk to Luca,\" she said firmly, meeting my gaze. \"Face to face.\"\nI nodded. \"We both need answers.\"\nWith a shaky exhale, Jenny pressed the call button. The phone rang, each chime stretching out like a drumbeat, echoing the thump of my own heart. When his voice came through, muffled but clear, she sat up straighter.\n\"Luca, we need to meet,\" she said, the command in her voice belying the tears that still wet her cheeks. There was a pause as she listened to his response, and I strained to catch the tone of his voice, but it was impossible to tell from her expression.\n\"Tonight. It can't wait,\" she continued. Another pause. Finally, her shoulders sagged slightly, a small nod signaling his agreement. \"Okay. I'll see you then.\"\nShe hung up and dropped the phone onto the bed with a soft thud. For a moment, neither of us said anything, the room steeped in tension, as if holding its breath.\n\"He agreed?\" I asked, my voice hushed, afraid of breaking the thin veil of calm she'd managed to weave around herself.\n\"Yes,\" Jenny confirmed, wiping her eyes one last time. \"We're meeting tonight.\"\nI reached over, squeezing her hand once more, a silent vow. Whatever came next, we would face it together.\n___\nLuca's POV \nThe soft creak of the front door pulled my attention away from the window, where the last hints of dusk painted the sky in streaks of purple and orange. Lexie walked in first, her expression cheerful as always, followed by Merlin, who was already mid-sentence, eyes wide with excitement.\n\"and then the doctor said I couldn't believe it, but there was a whole room full of sunflowers! Can you imagine, right in the middle of the hospital!\" Merlin's voice carried through the room, filled with the kind of wonder only he could muster.\nI couldn't help but smirk. Merlin always found a way to see the world through a kaleidoscope of curiosity, even in places like hospitals where people were more likely to notice beeping monitors than wildflowers.\nBenedicta, sitting in the armchair with a book balanced on her knee, looked up with a warm smile that faltered when her gaze landed on me. Her eyes narrowed slightly, not in suspicion but in that knowing way of hers. I barely had time to wonder what she'd say before she spoke.\n\"Who called, Luca?\" she asked, voice laced with the sort of concern that left no room for evasion.\n\"It was Jenny,\" I replied, exhaling slowly. \"She wants to meet tonight.\"\nA beat of silence followed the air in the room tightening like a coiled spring. Merlin's chatter had stopped, and even Lexie glanced between us with a frown, the weight of unspoken questions pressing down on everyone.\nBenedicta set her book aside and leaned forward. \"Be careful, Luca,\" she said, her tone serious, her eyes searching mine for a hint of reassurance. \"Don't do anything reckless, anything that might hurt you. And remember Lia.\"\nI swallowed hard at the mention of her name, the invisible line I'd been straddling for weeks suddenly sharp and glaring. I gave a small nod. \"I know. I'll be careful.\"\nBut the words felt hollow as if uttered from behind a mask. Guilt twisted inside me, a constant companion these days. I pushed it down and forced myself to stand, reaching for my keys on the table. The metallic clink cut through the silence.\n\"I won't be long,\" I said, aiming for a confidence I didn't quite feel. Merlin's gaze followed me, brows drawn together like he wanted to ask more questions, but even he stayed silent.\nBenedicta's eyes stayed on me as I turned to leave, their warmth underlined by an edge of worry that I carried with me out the door. The cool evening air bit at my skin, the quiet of the street offering no comfort. I climbed into the car, the driver's seat as familiar as my own shadow, but tonight it felt different-like a threshold I was crossing into something uncertain.\nI started the engine, the low rumble settling into my bones as I gripped the wheel tighter. The faint scent of Lia's perfume lingered in the fabric of the seat, a bittersweet reminder. I clenched my jaw, pushing the thought away. Tonight wasn't about Lia or the promises I'd made that felt like knots around my chest. Tonight was about facing Jenny, facing whatever she knew, and hoping I could find a way to navigate through this without sinking deeper.\nThe road stretched ahead, illuminated by the glow of the streetlamps and the soft wash of headlights passing by. I took a deep breath, feeling the miles spool out beneath me, each one carrying me closer to answers I wasn't sure I wanted but knew I couldn't avoid.\nBenedicta's parting words echoed in my mind as I drove: Don't do anything harmful, Luca. Remember Lia.\nBut the question that kept circling back was simple and sharp-what if facing the truth was already a kind of harm, one that no precaution could prevent?\n105\nLia's POV\nThe room felt too small, too suffocating. I paced back and forth, the rhythm of my steps doing nothing to soothe the chaos in my mind. The ticking of the clock on my desk seemed louder than usual, its sharp ticks matching the pounding of my heart. Just as I was about to circle around for the hundredth time, the door creaked open, and Finn stepped inside, his presence filling the room with an air of quiet intensity.\n\"Lia?\" His voice was gentle but probing. \"What's wrong?\"\nI turned to face him, forcing a smile that felt more like a grimace. \"It's nothing.\"\nFinn's eyebrows shot up, and he folded his arms across his chest. He was always perceptive, too perceptive for his own good. His green eyes searched my face, looking for cracks in the façade I worked so hard to maintain.\n\"Really?\" he said, a hint of disbelief lacing his words. \"Because you've been pacing for the last hour like you're trying to wear a path into the floor.\"\nI let out a breathless laugh. It was easier to deflect, to mask the discomfort swirling inside me. \"It's just nerves, I suppose.\"\nHe leaned against the doorframe, his expression softening. \"I still don't get it, you know. Why do you suddenly want to marry me.\" He hesitated as if measuring his next words. \"But if it's what you want, then it's cool.\"\nI laughed again, the sound sharper than I intended. The tension between us was palpable, but there was also an absurdity to it that I couldn't ignore. \"And I don't understand why your so-called cousin Bianca got so angry when she found out we were getting married.\"\nFinn flinched at the mention of Bianca, and I caught the subtle twitch in his jaw before he smoothed it out. He shifted uncomfortably, unable to meet my gaze. My smile widened, a predatory satisfaction creeping into my expression. He was nervous. Interesting.\n\"Are you going to tell me why she's so upset?\" I asked, tilting my head as if I were genuinely curious. \"Because I'd love to know.\"\nHe swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing. \"It's... complicated,\" he muttered, the word barely audible. His fingers fidgeted at his sides, a rare crack in his usually composed demeanor.\n\"Complicated,\" I repeated, savoring the weight of the word. \"Well, that makes me even more interested. You know, I'd love to join you and Bianca next time you go to the library. I think it could be... enlightening.\"\nFinn's eyes met mine for a fraction of a second, wide with surprise before he dropped them again. The room seemed to hold its breath, the air between us charged with silent tension. Without another word, he turned on his heel and left the room, closing the door behind him with a soft click.\nI watched him go, a chuckle slipping from my lips as soon as I was alone. This was getting more intriguing by the second.\nLuca's POV\nThe streetlights cast long, pale shadows as I stood by my car, the night air biting into my skin. I stuffed my hands into my pockets, watching as Jenny's car pulled up a few feet away. She stepped out, her heels clicking against the asphalt with a sharp, resolute rhythm. Even in the dim light, I could see the determined set of her jaw and the way her eyes flashed as she walked toward me.\n\"Luca,\" she said, stopping a few feet away. Her voice was firm, a demand masked as a greeting. \"Why did you reject the wedding?\"\nI looked at her, the weight of the question pressing on my chest. How could I explain what I barely understood myself? \"Because you didn't get my consent first,\" I said, my voice even. It was a partial truth, one I hoped would be enough to stop this conversation from spiraling out of control.\nHer eyes narrowed, a spark of frustration flickering within them. \"Well, now you know,\" she said, crossing her arms over her chest. \"So, the wedding must push through. There's no reason to delay it.\"\nI shook my head slowly, the chill of the night seeping into my bones. \"No, Jenny. It can't happen.\"\nA silence fell between us, heavy and suffocating. She tilted her head, a faint sneer curling at the edge of her lips. \"Do you have someone else in mind?\" she asked, her voice laced with mock amusement, as though daring me to confirm her suspicions.\nI hesitated, the question slicing through the layers of my resolve. The truth teetered on the edge of my tongue, dangerous and exposed. After a beat, I spoke, my voice low but clear. \"Yes. And you know who it is, so stop pretending, Jenny.\"\nHer eyes widened, the mask of control slipping for just an instant before she composed herself again. She opened her mouth, ready to lash back, but I didn't give her the chance. I turned and walked away, the echoes of her stunned silence trailing behind me.\nThe drive back to Benedicta's house was a blur, the darkened streets folding into one another as I replayed the conversation with Jenny in my head. The tension in her voice, the flicker of recognition when I'd said those words-I could still feel it, like an aftershock. But now, more than anything, a singular, fierce determination thrummed through me.\nI parked in front of Benedicta's house and killed the engine, the silence heavy in the wake of the car's soft hum. The porch light was on, casting a warm glow against the night. I stepped out, feeling the gravel crunch beneath my feet, and walked up the steps. Before I could knock, the door opened, revealing Benedicta, her sharp eyes reading my expression in an instant.\n\"How did it go?\" she asked, her voice calm, yet holding an edge of worry.\nI stepped inside, the familiar scent of lavender and old books enveloping me. I ran a hand through my hair, the weight of the evening pressing on my shoulders. \"It's done. Jenny knows the wedding isn't happening.\"\nShe arched an eyebrow, closing the door behind me. \"And what did she say?\"\n\"She tried to push for it, told me it had to go on, but I told her no.\" My voice was firmer than I expected, and I took a deep breath. \"Then she asked if there was someone else.\"\nBenedicta's gaze softened, the faintest hint of a smile playing on her lips. \"And what did you tell her?\"\n\"I told her the truth. That there is someone else. Someone she knows.\"\nHer eyes searched mine for a moment, and then she nodded as if she had expected nothing less. \"You did what you had to do, Luca. But now what?\"\n\"I need to see Lia,\" I said, the name falling from my lips with a mix of urgency and longing. \"I can't let her marry Finn. I won't. I love her, Benedicta. And I'm going to fight for her.\"\nBenedicta's smile grew, sad but proud. She reached out, placing a hand on my arm. \"Then go to her. Don't let fear or doubts hold you back. If you're going to fight, fight with everything you have.\"\nI nodded, the tightness in my chest easing slightly at her words. But the road ahead was still uncertain, and I knew this battle would be more complicated than just confronting Lia. It was the weight of unspoken truths, tangled loyalties, and the delicate balance we'd all been trying to maintain for too long.\nBut none of that mattered now. What mattered was her, and the chance to tell her everything-to make her see that she wasn't just someone I wanted; she was the only one.\nTurning back toward the door, I took another deep breath, steeling myself. The night was far from over, but for the first time in what felt like ages, I knew exactly what I had to do.\n106\nBianca's POV\nThe dim light in my room cast shadows on the walls, dark reflections of the thoughts swirling inside me. I paced back and forth, each step only fueling the anger that had settled deep in my chest since I'd learned of Finn and Lia's sudden engagement. The words felt hollow even as I repeated them in my mind, trying to make sense of it all. How could Finn not see this marriage as a trap, a way for others to pull his strings? He was playing right into their hands.\nA sharp knock echoed through my room, cutting through the silence and pulling me out of my thoughts. I took a deep breath and opened the door, finding myself face to face with Finn, his expression unreadable.\n\"Bianca,\" he said softly, his gaze steady but determined. \"Can I come in?\"\nI hesitated, but then I stepped aside, nodding. He entered, and before I could even process the shift in the room, he locked the door behind him. The quiet click of the lock was a reminder of how far he was pushing me tonight, but I kept my face impassive.\n\"Look,\" Finn began, his tone carrying a dismissiveness that felt like a slap. \"I know you're angry about the marriage, but it's happening. There's no point in fighting it.\"\nMy jaw tightened as I tried to rein in my temper. Without a word, I turned on my heel, walked to the door, and opened it, gesturing for him to leave. Finn watched me, disappointment flickering in his eyes, but he didn't try to argue. He simply stepped out, and the silence in the room felt heavier once he was gone.\nHe paused just outside, glancing over his shoulder. \"Meet me at the library at eight. There's something we need to talk about.\"\nI gave a slight nod, not trusting myself to speak. As he walked away, my fingers clenched around the doorknob, my anger simmering just below the surface. The nerve of him-to brush off my concerns as if they were nothing as if I were the one being unreasonable.\nMoments later, another knock sounded on the door, and I steeled myself for another confrontation. But when I opened it, it was Jenny standing there, her face flushed and tense. She entered without waiting for an invitation, her eyes immediately locking onto mine.\n\"Well?\" I asked, my voice cold. \"What's the outcome of your talk with Luca?\"\nJenny's mouth pressed into a thin line, and she shook her head, her expression hardening. \"He won't marry me. And we both know why.\"\n\"Lia,\" I whispered, her name bitter on my tongue. Jenny's mouth twisted into a snarl, and a dark look passed between us. We didn't need to say it out loud; we both knew that Lia was the reason everything was falling apart. My mind began churning with possibilities, and I clenched my fists, trying to bring some semblance of control to the chaos inside.\n\"Don't worry,\" I said finally, my voice low and steady. \"We'll figure something out. She can't ruin everything for us.\"\nLuca's POV\nThe drive back to my house was longer than usual, each mile stretching on as I replayed my conversation with Jenny in my mind. Her defiance, her frustration-they had all been reminders of the stakes in this tangled mess. It was like being caught in a web where every decision seemed to pull someone deeper into the darkness.\nWhen I finally pulled up to the house, I was greeted by the familiar scent of lavender drifting from the porch. I stepped inside, relishing the quiet, and made my way to the dimly lit living room. The stillness wrapped around me, comforting and foreboding at the same time.\nI poured myself a drink, the glass feeling cool against my fingertips as I sat down on the couch. Silence filled the room, thick and heavy, as I stared at the amber liquid swirling in the glass. Thoughts of Lia crept in, vivid and painful. I took a long sip, hoping it would dull the ache, but it only seemed to sharpen it.\nLia's wedding to Finn felt like a ticking time bomb, one that would explode and take everything I cared about with it. I couldn't allow it to happen, not like this. Not when I knew deep down that she didn't love him-not the way she should love someone she was going to marry. There was something else, something that kept pulling her back, but I couldn't quite reach it.\nI clenched the glass tighter, the cold pressing into my palm. There had to be a way out of this-a way to make her see that this marriage wasn't the answer. I could almost hear Benedicta's voice in my head, urging me to fight for her, to not let fear or doubt keep me from what mattered most.\nBut how? How could I stop her from going through with this when every move I made seemed to push her further away?\nImages of Lia and Finn together flooded my mind, stirring a surge of anger and jealousy that I struggled to control. My mind flashed back to the last time I'd seen her, the look in her eyes when I'd tried to tell her how I felt. She'd been so closed off, so guarded. And I knew that if I let her slip away now, there would be no second chances.\nI forced myself to take another drink, hoping it would clear my head, but the thoughts kept coming, relentless and unforgiving.\nLater that night my mind kept circling back to Lia's face, the way her eyes softened whenever she thought no one was watching, the quiet determination in her gaze when she was sure of something. And now, she was standing on the edge of a choice that could ruin everything. A choice that would bind her to someone she didn't truly want, all because of some sense of duty-or fear.\nThe frustration gnawed at me, eating away at my resolve. I couldn't let her go through with it. She deserved a life filled with love and passion, not one dictated by family alliances and obligations. But how could I make her see that?\nThe walls felt like they were closing in, and the silence only amplified the turmoil inside me. My hand hovered over my phone, the temptation to call her almost overwhelming. But I knew that showing up unannounced, demanding she reconsider, would only push her further away.\nI had to be patient, but patience had never felt more impossible.\n107\nBianca's POV\nAfter Finn had left, I sat alone in the dark, staring into the quiet night outside my window. Every fiber of my being screamed that this wasn't over-that I couldn't let it be over. Finn might think he was in control, but I could see the truth: he was slipping through my fingers, drawn to Lia in ways he didn't even understand.\nA dark plan began to take shape in my mind, forming slowly, taking root in the anger and resentment festering inside me. If Lia was going to stand between me and the life I deserved, then I would make sure she paid the price.\nI picked up my phone, dialing a familiar number. The line rang once, twice, before a gruff voice answered on the other end.\n\"I need a favor,\" I said, my tone laced with cold determination. \"And this time, it's non-negotiable.\"\nThere was a pause, then a low chuckle. \"I thought you'd come around. What do you need?\"\n\"Lia. I need you to make her rethink her choices.\"\nThe man laughed again, a sound that sent a chill down my spine, even though I'd heard it countless times before. \"Consider it done.\"\nAs I hung up the phone, a twisted sense of satisfaction filled me. I knew the road ahead was dangerous, that there was no turning back from the path I'd chosen. But I didn't care. If Lia wanted to ruin my life, I would make sure she suffered just as much-if not more.\nI sat there for a few moments longer, the silence of the room pressing in on me. My fingers hovered over the phone again, hesitating. There was one more thing I needed to do-another person I needed to talk to.\nI scrolled through my contacts, stopping at the number I was looking for. Her name flashed on the screen, and I took a deep breath before dialing. The phone rang a few times before she picked up.\n\"Bianca?\" she said, her voice a mix of curiosity and wariness. \"What's going on?\"\n\"Meet me at The Orchid Café in thirty minutes,\" I replied, my tone flat, businesslike. \"I have something important to discuss.\"\n\"I'll be there,\" she said, the line clicking off without another word.\nI didn't wait for anything else. I stood up, pacing the room as the minutes passed by, my mind racing. This wasn't just about Finn anymore-it was about removing any obstacle that stood between me and the life I'd always wanted. Lia had to be eliminated from the equation.\nThe Orchid Café wasn't far from my place. It was quiet and discreet-a perfect location for what I needed to discuss. I grabbed my jacket and quickly left the house, the weight of my plan settling heavily in my chest.\nAt the café, the dim lights and the warm aroma of coffee greeted me as I entered. I scanned the room and found her waiting at a corner table. Ava. The one person who could make things happen when you needed something messy to be cleaned up. Her dark hair framed her sharp features, and her eyes narrowed slightly as I approached.\n\"Bianca,\" she said, her voice tinged with caution as I sat down across from her. \"What's this about? You know I don't like surprises.\"\n\"I know,\" I said, leaning forward, my voice low. \"And this time, I need you to do something for me. Something... drastic.\"\nHer eyes locked on mine. She was a woman of few words, but when she spoke, her words carried weight. \"I'm listening.\"\nI felt the intensity of her gaze, and for a moment, I was reminded of why I always went to her for things like this. Ava had a way of reading people, knowing their deepest fears and desires, and using that to her advantage. She didn't need to be told twice-she could read between the lines.\n\"I need you to get rid of someone,\" I said, barely above a whisper, but the words cut through the air like a knife. \"Her name's Lia. She's... in the way.\"\nAva didn't flinch. She merely raised an eyebrow, folding her arms across her chest. \"In the way of what?\"\n\"In the way of my future. In the way of everything I've worked for.\" I leaned in, my hands gripping the edge of the table. \"I can't have her around anymore. Finn... he's blinded by her. He doesn't see it, but she's trying to steal everything from me. And I need her gone.\"\nAva's eyes darkened slightly, and she nodded slowly. \"What do you want me to do?\"\n\"I need you to pretend to be an event planner. I want you to get close to her. Organize some... kind of event, anything to get her out of her comfort zone. Make her trust you. And once you've done that\" I paused, my heart beating faster as I pictured it. \"You can do whatever you want.\"\nAva's lips curled into a slight smirk, and there was a cold edge to her voice when she responded. \"I like how you think, Bianca.\"\nI leaned back in my chair, feeling the weight of the plan settle in my bones. \"You're the best at what you do, Ava. And once Lia's out of the picture, Finn won't have anyone to turn to. He'll have no choice but to come back to me. Everything will fall into place.\"\nAva gave me a look that made it clear she was already formulating her next steps. \"Don't worry. It'll be done.\"\nI felt a small shiver run down my spine, but it wasn't fear-it was exhilaration. The pieces of the puzzle were starting to fall into place, and I wasn't about to stop now. Lia wouldn't know what hit her.\nWe sat in silence for a moment longer before Ava stood, her movements sharp and purposeful. \"I'll contact you once it's taken care of. You'll be the first to know.\"\nI nodded, watching her walk away, feeling a twisted satisfaction bloom within me. I had all the pieces I needed now. There was no stopping me. No turning back.\nAs I left the café, the night air felt colder, but I couldn't shake the feeling of anticipation that buzzed in my veins. The game was just beginning. And this time, I would be the one to win.\n108\nLuca's POV \nThe minutes ticked by, each one pulling me closer to a decision I knew I could never take back. My heart pounded as I sat there, gripping the edges of the armchair in Benedicta's living room. I'd been over it all a hundred times in my head, weighing every word I might say, every possible outcome. But as the minutes passed, it became clear that thinking wasn't going to get me anywhere. It was time to act.\nWith a surge of determination, I finally stood up, grabbing my keys from the table. I didn't know exactly what I'd say, or how I'd stop this wedding, but I knew I had to try. There was no way I could sit back and let Lia marry Finn. Not when I was ready to lay everything on the line for her.\nAs I opened the door, the cool night air hit my face, and for a moment, it was like a shot of clarity. I could feel a path opening in front of me, even if it was narrow and uncertain. I was done waiting, done standing on the sidelines. I would fight for Lia with everything I had-even if it meant crossing lines I never thought I would.\nThe drive to Finn's territory felt longer than it had any right to. Each mile seemed to stretch, each turn tightening the knot in my chest. The sky was pitch black, with only the faint glow of streetlights here and there, illuminating the road just enough to guide my way. Finally, I pulled up to the gate of Finn's pack, the tall iron bars casting long, ominous shadows across the ground. I parked, feeling the weight of everything I wanted to say pressing down on me.\nI stepped out of the car and closed the door quietly, hoping not to draw any immediate attention. For a brief second, I just stood there, gathering my thoughts. Then, reaching into my pocket, I pulled out my phone and scrolled through my contacts until Lia's name appeared on the screen. I took a deep breath and hit the call button, holding the phone to my ear as it rang.\nEach ring felt like an eternity, my pulse thudding in sync with the sound. Just as I thought it might go to voicemail, Lia picked up.\n\"Luca?\" Her voice was soft and cautious, as if she already sensed something was wrong.\n\"Lia,\" I said, struggling to keep my voice steady. \"I'm at the gate. Please, come out. I need to talk to you.\"\nShe hesitated, and I could almost feel her glance around, torn between my request and the boundaries she now had to respect. \"Luca, I can't. You know it's it's not right for you to be here.\"\nBefore I could respond, I noticed movement in the distance. Two guards and a sentinel were making their way toward me, their steps purposeful and their expressions stern. They must have noticed my car and come to check. My grip tightened on the phone.\n\"Lia, please,\" I said urgently, watching the guards approach. \"I'm not here to cause trouble. Just come out for a minute.\"\n\"Luca,\" she whispered, her tone strained, \"you need to go. If they see you here, it'll only make things worse.\"\nThe guards were close now, one of them motioning for me to leave. \"Sir, you're not authorized to be here,\" the guard said firmly, crossing his arms as he blocked my view of the gate. \"This is private territory. You need to leave immediately.\"\nI could still hear Lia on the other end of the line, breathing softly, hesitating. I turned away from the guards, lowering my voice. \"Lia, listen to me. I put a stop to my wedding with Jenny. I couldn't go through with it, not when not when you're all I think about.\"\nShe was silent, and I could feel the weight of her thoughts as if they were my own.\n\"So, please,\" I continued, desperation creeping into my voice. \"Do the same, Lia. Don't marry Finn. If you're doing this because you thought I was going to be with Jenny, then then don't. Let's stop this before it's too late.\"\nThere was a long pause, and then I heard her sigh, a sad, resigned sound. \"Luca, I can't just stop everything now. This is about more than you and me. Finn it would be humiliating for him if I backed out now.\"\nMy chest tightened at her words. \"Humiliating for him? What about us, Lia? Doesn't that matter to you?\"\n\"It does,\" she said quietly. \"But I went through with this because I thought you'd already made your choice. You can't blame me for that. You can't show up here now and ask me to ruin everything I set in motion.\"\nI felt a sharp, hollow ache in my chest. \"So that's it?\" I asked, barely able to keep the hurt from my voice. \"You'd rather protect him than take a chance on us?\"\n\"Luca, please understand,\" she said, her voice breaking. \"It's not as simple as that. I have to go.\"\n\"Lia-\" I started, but she'd already hung up. The line went dead, and I was left standing there, the silence pressing down on me like a weight.\nI lowered the phone from my ear, staring at it in disbelief. My hands were shaking with frustration, with anger, with every emotion I'd tried to keep buried for too long. Before I even realized what I was doing, I hurled the phone onto the ground, watching as it shattered into pieces, the small fragments scattering across the pavement.\nThe guards were still watching me, wary but silent. I didn't care. Without another word, I turned, got back into my car, and slammed the door shut. My heart felt like it was being squeezed, a pain I hadn't expected searing through my chest.\nAs I drove away from Finn's territory, the night felt darker and colder, and I realized that, for the first time, I had no idea where to go from there. I'd put everything on the line and left myself vulnerable, only to have her turn away, unwilling to take the same risk.\nBut as painful as it was, one thing became clear at that moment: I wasn't giving up on Lia. Not yet. Not while there was still a chance to make her see what we could be together.\n109\nLia's POV\nI woke up feeling as though a weight had settled on my chest. The conversation with Luca from the night before replayed in my mind like a haunting melody, filling me with an ache I couldn't shake. He'd asked me to call off the wedding and pleaded with me to see the future we could have together. And yet, I hadn't been able to agree, the idea of humiliating Finn and unraveling everything I'd promised myself pushing back against everything Luca had said.\nI sighed, pushing away the lingering sadness as I dressed. My heart felt heavy, but I couldn't let it show. Not today. Finn and his family expected me to play my role, to be the poised fiancée, and I couldn't afford to slip. After fixing my hair and straightening my clothes, I took one last look in the mirror, steeling myself, and headed downstairs.\nWhen I entered the dining room, I saw that everyone else was already seated. Bianca sat to Finn's left, her dark eyes narrowing as they landed on me. Next to her, Finn's sister, Alina, held an equally icy expression. I swallowed, forcing myself to look past the silent hostility in their glares. Whatever issues they had with me, I couldn't let it unsettle me now.\nAs I approached, Finn stood up, smiling warmly. \"Lia,\" he greeted, pulling out a chair beside him. I sat down, offering him a polite smile as he leaned in and pressed a light kiss to my cheek. The gesture, though gentle, felt hollow, as if he were reminding the others of our bond more than sharing a real moment between us. I could almost feel Bianca's glare intensify from across the table.\nThe maid appeared, laying plates in front of us. The scent of fresh herbs and roasted vegetables filled the room, but I had no appetite. I glanced at Bianca and caught the sneer still lingering on her face, a silent reminder of the invisible wall that had grown between us.\nTurning to Finn, I cleared my throat and spoke with a calmness I barely felt. \"Finn, I've arranged to meet with an event planner today to discuss some ideas for the wedding. Since Bianca isn't very occupied around the house, I thought it would be nice for her to join me. She could help me pick out a design and theme for the ceremony.\"\nFinn's face lit up with approval. \"That's a great idea, Lia. I'm sure Bianca would be happy to lend a hand.\"\nFor a fleeting moment, I felt a sliver of satisfaction as I looked at Bianca. Her eyes widened in shock, her mouth opening as if she wanted to protest, but she quickly closed it, casting a look of veiled resentment my way instead. She nodded, though it was clear she didn't want to agree.\n\"Of course,\" she said coolly, barely hiding the displeasure in her tone. \"I'd be honored.\"\nThe table fell into silence as the maids served our plates, and I focused on the food in front of me, picking at it more than actually eating. Finn reached over, his hand resting gently on mine, his smile kind but slightly oblivious to the tension that crackled in the room. It felt surreal, pretending as though things were perfect when, deep down, I knew nothing could be further from the truth.\nJust then, the door creaked open, and one of the sentinels stepped in, his gaze moving respectfully between us. He held something in his hand, his expression cautious as he approached the table.\n\"Sir,\" he addressed Finn, holding out a small object. \"We found this phone just outside the main gate, lying on the ground.\"\nImmediately, my heart skipped a beat as I recognized the scuffed casing and faint crack on the screen. Luca's phone.\nI held my breath, trying to keep my face neutral, but a flicker of panic gripped me. Finn noticed my reaction, his brow furrowing slightly as he looked down at the phone in the sentinel's hand.\n\"Did you see who left it?\" Finn asked his tone a blend of curiosity and concern.\nThe sentinel shook his head. \"No, sir. We found it on our morning patrol. It didn't belong to anyone on our team.\"\nFinn's expression grew thoughtful, and he nodded, accepting the phone from the sentinel. \"Check the CCTV footage from last night,\" he instructed, holding the phone carefully. \"And look through the contacts or any identifying information. Let's find out who this belongs to.\"\nThe sentinel gave a quick nod. \"Right away, sir,\" he said, taking the phone back and excusing himself from the room.\nI forced myself to look away, breathing carefully as I felt Finn's gaze shift to me. He looked as though he was about to say something, but his focus was soon diverted by Bianca, who leaned forward, a knowing smirk tugging at the corner of her lips.\n\"Isn't it strange, Finn?\" she mused. \"We never have unexpected visitors here. I wonder what sort of person would come all this way just to leave their phone at the gate.\"\nI clenched my fists under the table, keeping my expression calm as I glanced at Finn. He was frowning now, looking down at his plate, clearly considering her words. I knew Bianca had her suspicions, and now, with Luca's phone in the guards' possession, she was all too eager to stir trouble.\nBut I couldn't let her. Not now.\n\"Probably just a mistake,\" I said lightly, forcing a small smile. \"You know how careless people can be with their phones. I'm sure it'll be easy enough to return once the guards have checked it out.\"\nFinn looked at me for a moment, his eyes searching my face, and I held his gaze, hoping he wouldn't see past my calm facade. After a beat, he nodded, his expression relaxing as he squeezed my hand.\n\"Let's not worry about it,\" he said finally, looking around the table with a reassuring smile. \"I'm sure it's nothing serious.\"\nBianca's smile faded as Finn moved on, his focus returning to the meal and the plans we had for the day. Though the unease in my chest remained, I relaxed slightly, relieved that for now, the topic was behind us.\nAs the meal continued, Bianca kept her gaze fixed on me, her frustration simmering beneath the surface. I'd have to tread carefully today, not just for myself but to ensure no one discovered what had really happened last night.\nFor now, all I could do was play my part and hope that Luca's presence at the gate would remain nothing more than a rumor.\n110\nFinn's POV\nI walked into my office, eager for a moment of solitude to collect my thoughts. The events of the day were already enough to make my head spin-Lia's suggestion to bring Bianca along to the event planner and the strange phone found by the gate. I needed a moment to sort it all out in my mind.\nBut I'd barely had time to sit down when the door opened, and Bianca slipped inside, her eyes locked on me with a determined glint.\n\"Bianca,\" I said, exasperated, \"I need to concentrate. I don't have time for interruptions right now. Can you please leave?\"\nBut she didn't seem the least bit interested in listening. Instead, she walked up to me, her expression softening as she drew closer. She placed one hand on my face, her fingers trailing along my cheek in a way that was both familiar and unsettling. I opened my mouth to protest, but before I could, she leaned in, her lips hovering dangerously close to mine.\n\"Bianca,\" I said, my tone more forceful this time, though I was beginning to feel trapped by her insistence.\nJust then, the door swung open, and Lia walked in. She paused, her expression flashing briefly with surprise, but she recovered quickly, her face shifting into calm neutrality. Her gaze darted between Bianca and me, her expression unreadable.\n\"Oh, Finn,\" she said, her tone as composed as ever. \"I just wanted to let you know I'll be going out for a bit. I haven't finished inviting people for the wedding.\"\nI nodded, grateful for the interruption and for her ability to mask whatever she'd seen. \"All right,\" I replied. \"Let me know if you need anything.\"\nWithout another word, she gave a brief nod and turned, leaving us alone again. The moment she was gone, Bianca dropped her hand from my face, her expression hardening.\n\"Don't you think it's odd?\" she said, her voice low, her gaze narrowing toward the closed door. \"I think Lia knows something about that phone found at the gate. We need to find out who it belongs to and why it's here. She's hiding something, Finn-I'm sure of it.\"\nI turned away from her, already tired of her constant insinuations. \"Bianca, don't start with this again,\" I said, my tone dismissive as I sank into my chair. \"Lia isn't a suspect, and I trust her completely. She has nothing to hide.\"\nFor a moment, Bianca just stared at me, her eyes flashing with irritation and disbelief. \"I can't believe you're so blind to what's happening right in front of you,\" she muttered, her voice laced with anger. \"You're going to regret this.\"\nWithout waiting for a response, she spun on her heel and strode out of the office, slamming the door behind her. The echo of her exit lingered in the room, but I pushed it aside, focusing on the calm I desperately needed to maintain.\nI took a steadying breath, but I couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that had crept in. As much as I trusted Lia, the timing of her unexpected visit and the appearance of that phone didn't sit right with me. Bianca's accusations were groundless, but I still needed to know if there was any truth lurking beneath her paranoia.\nAfter a moment's hesitation, I picked up my phone and dialed a number, waiting for the call to connect. When a voice answered on the other end, I kept my tone low and measured.\n\"I need you to keep an eye on Lia,\" I said, my voice quiet but firm. \"I want to know where she's going and who she meets. Report back with everything.\"\nWith that, I ended the call, hoping that whatever I found would confirm what I already knew: that Lia was trustworthy.\n____\nLia's POV\nA small smile spread across my face as I slipped into my car and started the engine. I hadn't left Finn's office door right away. Instead, I'd paused, leaning just close enough to listen to the exchange inside, my ear pressed against the heavy wood. What I heard had been worth it: Bianca's voice, tense and insistent, accusing me of hiding something about the phone found at the gate. Finn had defended me, dismissing her accusations and saying he trusted me completely.\nIt was gratifying to hear him stand by me, especially when Bianca's animosity was so obvious. But her suspicion was unnerving, as was her refusal to let it go. Now, I'd have to watch my steps even more carefully.\nAs I pulled out of the driveway and started toward Benedicta's house, I couldn't help but feel a sense of urgency. I needed to see Luca, to tell him what had happened, and to warn him about Bianca's suspicions. I picked up my phone and tried to dial his number, but each call only led to an automated message saying the line was unreachable. Frustration simmered as I hung up, gripping the steering wheel tighter.\nThen, almost instinctively, my thoughts shifted to the phone found near the gate earlier that morning. A sick feeling crept over me as a realization hit: it had to be Luca's. The timing, his calls going straight to voicemail-it all fits too perfectly. He must have come to see me last night and lost his phone in the process. I could only imagine how he'd felt, being turned away without a word.\n\"Damn it!\" I muttered, hitting the steering wheel in frustration. The unexpected force of my action made my car veer slightly off the road. I tried to correct it, but it was too late; the tires skidded and with a sudden jolt, my car collided with a pole, the impact sending a shudder through my bones.\n\"Ugh!\" I groaned, bracing myself as the car finally came to a halt. My heart was racing, the shock of the crash vibrating through me. Thankfully, it hadn't been too severe, and after a moment, I managed to catch my breath.\nOpening the door, I stepped out, brushing a stray lock of hair out of my face. Just as I examined the damage to the front bumper, I noticed another car pulling up behind me. The vehicle parked at an odd distance, far enough to seem cautious, yet close enough to keep me in sight. I watched, the hairs on the back of my neck prickling. This was no random passerby.\nI'd seen that car parked outside Finn's estate before.\nWith a steadying breath, I squared my shoulders and walked toward the car. The driver, a tall, nondescript man in a dark jacket, rolled down his window, his expression blank as he looked at me. I raised an eyebrow, folding my arms as I regarded him coolly.\n\"You can stop pretending you're here by accident,\" I said, my voice calm but laced with authority. \"We both know Finn sent you to follow me.\"\nThe man's expression didn't change, but I caught the slight twitch of his mouth, betraying his discomfort. \"Ma'am, I'm not sure what you're talking about. I was just passing by.\"\n\"Right,\" I said, rolling my eyes. \"Let's not waste time. If Finn wants updates on where I'm going, you can tell him yourself. And while you're at it, call him and let him know that his driver should come pick up my car. I don't have time to wait here.\"\nThe man hesitated, clearly torn between following orders and respecting my request. But I wasn't about to let him wriggle out of it.\n\"I'll make it simple,\" I continued, leaning in closer. \"You can either make the call and tell Finn's driver to take care of the car, or you can let him know you lost track of me and deal with his reaction later. Your choice.\"\nHe swallowed, glancing away as if weighing his options. After a moment, he pulled out his phone, dialing a number while glancing at me from the corner of his eye.\nI gave him a faint, satisfied smile, then turned on my heel and walked back to the road, leaving him to explain the situation to Finn.\n111\nFinn's POV\n\"What do you mean her car got damaged?\" I barked into the phone, my voice echoing down the hall. I gripped the phone tighter, barely able to keep my frustration in check. The man on the other end was stammering through his words, and every second I had to wait felt like another jab of irritation.\n\"Sir Lia's car hit a pole,\" he finally managed. \"She's fine, but, uh, she decided to leave in a taxi. She instructed me to call and have one of the drivers come to pick up her car.\"\nI gritted my teeth, feeling a rush of anger pulsed through me. \"So she just left? Without letting anyone know what happened?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" he replied, his voice timid. \"She, um, seemed in a hurry and said she'd take care of things herself.\"\nI was about to say more, but a voice floated in from down the hall, and I turned to see Alina, my sister, standing there, her arms crossed with a smirk already spreading across her face. I ended the call abruptly, not wanting her to hear any more than she already had.\n\"Oh, that is rich,\" Alina laughed, barely able to contain her amusement. \"Your precious bride-to-be crashes her car and doesn't even bother to call you? And instead of you going to her, she just what, sends for a driver to clean up the mess?\"\n\"Alina,\" I warned, already exhausted by her taunting.\nShe took a step closer, her laughter still simmering. \"Is this really the woman you're planning to marry, Finn? I mean, if she's already treating you like her personal cleanup crew, I can only imagine what life will be like for you after the wedding.\" Her eyes glinted with mischief, relishing the chance to rattle me.\n\"Enough.\" I shunned her instantly, my voice cold. I didn't have the patience for this today, least of all from her.\nBut she didn't back down, the smile never leaving her face. \"Fine, fine. But just think about it, dear brother. Some of us can see the mess you're walking into, even if you can't.\"\nI turned away, biting back the retort that was on the tip of my tongue. Her laughter followed me as I walked down the hall, my irritation simmering with every step. The last thing I needed was Alina meddling in my business. I didn't care what she thought of Lia; Alina's perspective on anyone other than herself had always been skewed.\nI was so focused on keeping my composure that I nearly ran into Bianca as she came around the corner. Her eyes widened in surprise, and she reached out, steadying herself against my arm.\n\"Finn,\" she said, concern creasing her brow. \"What's going on?\"\nI shook my head, feeling too frustrated to explain. \"Nothing, Bianca. Just don't worry about it.\"\nHer gaze followed me, but I couldn't bring myself to stop and talk. I needed space to think, to sort through what had just happened without Bianca or Alina picking it apart and making it worse.\nAs I moved away from her and headed toward my office, I forced myself to focus. I would deal with the car, and I would deal with Lia, and no amount of meddling from anyone was going to change that.\n___\nLia's POV\nI arrived at Benedicta's house, feeling a strange sense of relief wash over me. The morning had been tense, and the drive here, with everything replaying in my mind, had only tightened the knots in my chest. But as I stepped into the cozy warmth of Benedicta's home, I felt myself begin to relax.\nThe moment I walked in, Merlin came bounding over, his face lighting up as soon as he saw me. \"Lia!\" he called, throwing his small arms around my waist in a fierce hug.\nI laughed, scooping him up into my arms. \"Merlin, my little knight,\" I said, kissing the top of his head. \"Have you been keeping the kingdom safe while I've been away?\"\nHe giggled, nodding proudly. \"Of course! I made a fort out of the sofa cushions,\" he said, his eyes wide with excitement.\n\"That sounds like a castle fit for a true knight,\" I replied, giving him a squeeze. \"Now, go show me how brave you are, and let Benedicta and me talk for a bit, okay?\"\nHe nodded, wriggling down from my arms and running off toward the living room. I watched him go, my heart softening. If only everything in my life could be as simple as Merlin's joy over his little forts and pretend castles.\nI turned back to see Benedicta watching me with a gentle smile, though her eyes seemed to hold a hint of concern. She motioned me over to the kitchen table, and we both sat down.\n\"Benedicta,\" I began, taking a steadying breath. \"I've been trying to reach Luca all morning, but his phone keeps going straight to voicemail.\"\nBenedicta's smile faded slightly, her brow furrowing. \"That's strange. He always keeps his phone on him.\"\n\"I know,\" I said, the worry that had been gnawing at me since breakfast resurfacing. \"I wouldn't be so concerned, but this morning a phone was found outside Finn's gate. I have a feeling it's Luca's.\"\nShe drew in a sharp breath, her expression turning serious. \"Luca went to see you last night, didn't he?\"\nI nodded, pressing my lips together, unsure of how much to reveal. \"Yes. I think he might have been outside, trying to reach me. But Finn's guards must have scared him off, and he must have left his phone behind.\"\nBenedicta's face filled with worry as she took this in. \"If that phone was Luca's, and it was found by Finn's people\" She trailed off, her fingers tracing patterns on the table as she seemed to be calculating the risks.\nJust then, the door opened, and Luca walked in, his gaze flickering between us, clearly sensing the tension in the room. \"Lia,\" he said, his expression softening when he saw me. \"I'm glad you're here.\"\nBenedicta looked up, her relief clear. \"Luca! Lia was just telling me about the phone. Is it true? Did you leave your phone outside Finn's gate?\"\nLuca's face tightened slightly, a flicker of frustration crossing his features. \"Yes,\" he admitted, his voice steady. \"I threw it. I was angry, and I wasn't exactly thinking straight.\"\nI looked at him, my own worry mixing with relief. \"But what if Finn finds it? What if he-\"\nHe held up a hand, cutting me off. \"Don't worry. I already deactivated everything on the phone remotely. All the data's wiped clean. There's nothing on there that could trace it back to me.\"\nBenedicta's shoulders relaxed, though she still looked troubled. \"Are you sure, Luca? Finn's pack has a way of digging deeper than most.\"\nHe nodded confidently. \"I'm sure. There's nothing left for them to find. I made sure of it.\"\nA sense of relief washed over me, and I rose from my seat, crossing the room to where he stood. Without thinking, I wrapped my arms around him, feeling the familiar comfort of his presence steadying me. He returned the embrace, his arms warm and reassuring around me.\n\"Thank you,\" I murmured, my voice barely above a whisper. \"For always being there, even when things get complicated.\"\nHe gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze, his voice soft as he replied, \"I'd do anything for you, Lia. You know that.\"\nWe pulled apart, but the warmth of his support lingered, giving me the strength I needed to face whatever came next.\nIi2\nLia's POV\nAfter Luca's reassurances about the phone, I felt a weight lift, but my mind still buzzed with the uncertainty of everything unfolding around me. As Benedicta and I stood by the front door, waiting for my cab to arrive, I could see the worry in her eyes.\nShe placed a comforting hand on my shoulder. \"Lia, are you certain you want to go back today?\" Her tone was soft but probing. \"It seems complicated there. And with Bianca stirring things up, maybe you could use a little more time away.\"\nI managed a small smile, appreciating her concern. \"I know, Benedicta. But if I leave things hanging, Bianca will only get bolder. And Finn-he needs to hear the truth from me before he hears any more half-truths from her.\"\nBenedicta sighed, pulling me into a hug. \"Just be careful, all right?\" She stepped back, her gaze serious. \"I know you're strong, but that doesn't mean you need to do it all alone. Promise you'll reach out if things get too difficult.\"\n\"I promise.\" I gave her hand a reassuring squeeze just as the cab pulled up in front of the house. \"Thank you-for everything.\"\nShe nodded, a sad smile softening her expression as she watched me head down the driveway and into the waiting cab. As the car pulled away, I leaned back into the seat, bracing myself for what awaited me at Finn's estate.\nThe drive back was uneventful, but as we neared the gates, a growing sense of dread stirred in me. I couldn't shake the feeling that today was going to bring more challenges. And, as if on cue, the moment I stepped out of the cab and headed toward the entrance, Bianca appeared from the side path, as though she'd been waiting for me.\n\"Lia,\" she greeted, her voice laced with sweetness that dripped with insincerity. Her gaze swept over me, assessing, her lips curving into a smirk. \"You're finally back. I was beginning to think you'd decided to abandon your role here altogether.\"\nI lifted my chin, refusing to let her bait me. \"Nice to see you too, Bianca,\" I replied, keeping my tone steady. \"Though I'd expect that by now, you'd have grown used to people having other business outside these walls.\"\nShe narrowed her eyes, not even trying to hide her disdain. \"Funny you should say that, Lia. I've been meaning to talk to you about your extracurricular activities.\"\nI arched an eyebrow, feigning surprise. \"Oh? I wasn't aware I needed to account for every moment of my time with you.\"\nBianca's expression hardened. \"You may think you can do as you please, but let me remind you, you're marrying into a family that has standards. And disappearing without a word, leaving Finn to clean up your mess-like that little incident with your car-isn't exactly becoming of his future wife.\"\nI clenched my jaw, forcing myself to stay composed. \"I trust Finn knows what kind of person I am, Bianca. And he certainly doesn't need you speaking on his behalf.\"\nShe took a step closer, her voice lowering, as though sharing a secret. \"You really think he doesn't see through you? Believe me, it won't be long before he realizes that all you're doing is pretending.\" She leaned back, crossing her arms with a satisfied smile. \"After all, it's only a matter of time before you reveal your true colors.\"\nI met her gaze, refusing to back down. \"I'd be careful if I were you, Bianca. You might find that the people you're so desperate to deceive are already watching you closely.\"\nHer smirk faltered for just an instant, but she quickly recovered, tossing her hair over her shoulder. \"Enjoy playing pretend while it lasts,\" she said, brushing past me with one last withering look.\nI watched her go, a sense of calm defiance settling over me. If Bianca wanted to play this game, then I would make sure she knew exactly who she was dealing with.\nFinn's POV\nAfter the morning's chaos, I was determined to put the issue of the phone behind us. The guards had reviewed the CCTV footage, meticulously scanning each frame for clues about the phone's origin, but it had turned up nothing. Whoever had left it there had been careful, or perhaps lucky, leaving us with nothing useful. All we had was a phone with no apparent links to its owner-no photos, contacts, or messages. Just a dead end.\nStill, the whole thing left me uneasy, and not just because of Bianca's constant insinuations about Lia. She had been quick to plant seeds of suspicion, but I couldn't bring myself to believe them. Lia wasn't the type to keep secrets, not like this.\nI was sitting in my office, the phone lying on my desk as I stared at it, lost in thought. The investigation felt like a loose thread I couldn't pull, and the more I thought about it, the more it gnawed at me.\nThe door creaked open, and I looked up to see Alina stepping inside, her expression as smug as ever.\n\"Still brooding over that phone, Finn?\" she asked, clearly enjoying my frustration. \"Or maybe it's Lia's latest disappearance that has you so on edge?\"\nI frowned, already weary of her meddling. \"Alina, I'm not in the mood for this.\"\nShe shrugged, leaning casually against the doorway. \"I'm just trying to help, you know. But if you're so determined to ignore every red flag, then by all means, keep going.\" Her gaze drifted to the phone on my desk. \"But don't say I didn't warn you when things start falling apart.\"\nI clenched my teeth, barely restraining my irritation. \"Alina, Lia has done nothing to warrant this constant suspicion. That phone could belong to anyone, and without any evidence, there's no reason to jump to conclusions.\"\nShe rolled her eyes, clearly unimpressed. \"Suit yourself, Finn. But remember, I know what I'm talking about. I'd hate to see you blindsided because you refused to see the truth.\"\nWithout waiting for a response, she turned and left, leaving me alone with the unsettling reminder of her words.\n113\nBianca's POV\nThe low hum of the afternoon lull drifted through the room as Jenny and I sat across from each other, an unspoken understanding thickening the air between us. The plan had taken shape in my mind, piece by piece, each detail carefully calculated. Lia had lingered in Finn's life far too long, a thorn in my side and a threat to the future I deserved. If Lia was going to stand in my way, she needed to be removed-permanently.\nJenny shifted in her seat, studying me with that sharp, almost predatory look I'd come to expect from her. She wasn't the woman I used to know; there was something harder, colder in her gaze now. But then again, maybe that's why she was perfect for this plan.\n\"So, what's next?\" she asked, a hint of impatience in her voice. \"We've gone over the details, Bianca. We've done the groundwork. When do we actually make this happen?\"\nA thin smile crept over my lips. \"Soon, Jenny. Very soon. I've already put someone on this. I'm just waiting for an update.\"\nAs if on cue, my phone buzzed on the table. I glanced down at the screen and felt a jolt of satisfaction. It was one of the guys I'd hired to handle the mess that was Lia. Perfect timing.\nI answered, keeping my voice low. \"Yes?\"\n\"Bianca, we're set. Just need final instructions and the go-ahead,\" the man said, his tone curt, businesslike. He'd been in this line of work long enough to know when to keep his questions to a minimum.\n\"Good. Meet me at the clearing behind the old church in an hour,\" I replied, my voice laced with cold efficiency. \"We'll finalize everything there.\"\nI hung up, feeling the pulse of adrenaline course through me. Finally, after all the planning and all the frustration of watching Lia worm her way into Finn's life, we were on the brink of getting what we wanted.\nJenny raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. \"Was that him? Our 'solution' to the Lia problem?\"\n\"Yes,\" I confirmed, a hint of a smile tugging at the corners of my mouth. \"I'm meeting him soon to go over the final details.\"\nJenny leaned forward, a glint of excitement in her eyes. \"Good. Then I'm coming with you. We're in this together, remember?\"\nFor a moment, I considered turning her down-this wasn't her fight, not directly, and if things went sideways, I didn't want her getting in the way. But as I met her determined gaze, I knew there was no use arguing. She was just as invested in Lia's removal as I was.\n\"Fine,\" I said with a nod. \"But keep it discreet. We can't afford any mistakes.\"\nShe gave me a wicked smile. \"You can count on me.\"\nLia's POV\nI lay stretched out on my bed, letting the quiet wash over me. The past few days had been chaotic, the pressure of the impending wedding looming larger than I'd expected. Finn and I were supposed to get married in two days, yet my heart felt heavier with each passing moment. I didn't know what I was waiting for-some clarity, maybe, or a sign that this was truly what I wanted. But that certainty eluded me, leaving only a hollow ache.\nThe quiet knock on my door startled me, and before I could respond, Finn walked in. His expression was softer than usual, a strange combination of calm and something else-something almost cautious.\n\"Lia,\" he greeted, coming to sit on the edge of the bed beside me. \"How are you feeling?\"\nI gave him a small smile, hoping to mask the confusion still lingering in my mind. \"Just resting. Trying to take in everything before the big day.\"\nHe nodded, his gaze thoughtful. \"I thought we could talk about the wedding. Make sure we're on the same page.\"\n\"Of course,\" I replied, sitting up and giving him my full attention. There was a look in his eyes, something searching, almost as if he were trying to read the hidden thoughts behind my expression.\n\"Lia,\" he began, his tone cautious. \"I want to make sure this is truly what you want. That you don't feel pressured in any way.\"\nI forced myself to hold his gaze, sensing the careful probing beneath his words. \"I agreed to marry you, Finn,\" I said, my voice steady. \"I wouldn't be here if I didn't think this was right for us.\"\nHe nodded slowly, but I could see he wasn't entirely satisfied. \"It's just sometimes it feels like there's a part of you that's holding back. I know Bianca can be difficult, but I don't want anything clouding your feelings about this.\"\nI took a breath, choosing my words carefully. \"Bianca isn't the reason for any hesitation, Finn. I I've just had a lot on my mind. This wedding, our future-it's all happening so fast.\"\nHis expression softened, a hint of relief breaking through his initial concern. \"I understand. I just want to make sure that we're moving forward together, with complete trust.\"\nI managed a small nod, wishing I could give him more. \"I appreciate that, Finn. And I want us to have a future that's built on trust too.\"\nFor a moment, silence settled between us, comfortable yet fraught with the weight of unspoken questions. But before either of us could say more, his phone buzzed in his pocket. He glanced at the screen, and his expression shifted, becoming more focused.\n\"I'm sorry, I have to take this,\" he said, standing up.\n\"Is it something important?\" I asked, curiosity piqued by the sudden change in his demeanor.\nFinn hesitated, glancing back at me. \"It's about the phone found outside the gate. They may have found a clue as to who owns it.\"\nMy heart skipped a beat, though I forced myself to stay calm. \"Oh? I didn't think they'd find much.\"\nHe gave a small shrug. \"Neither did I. But we'll see. I'll let you know if there's anything worth mentioning.\"\nI nodded, watching him as he left the room, his figure disappearing into the hallway. The door clicked shut behind him, and I sat there, my mind spinning.\n114",

        "content": "Jenny's POV\nBianca and I walked briskly through the car park, our heels clicking against the concrete in unison. The late afternoon sun was beginning to dip, casting long shadows across the parked cars. I glanced at Bianca, who wore a look of fierce determination. Her eyes were fixed ahead, her jaw set. This wasn't the Bianca I had grown up with-she'd changed, grown harder and sharper. But then, so had I.\nWe reached her car, a sleek black sedan that seemed fitting for the kind of conversations we'd been having lately. Without a word, she unlocked the doors, and we both slipped inside. Bianca's hands were steady as she gripped the wheel and started the engine, her eyes flicking over to me as she shifted into gear.\n\"You ready for this?\" she asked, a slight edge to her voice.\nI met her gaze, giving her a small nod. \"Of course. We're in this together, remember?\"\nA ghost of a smile crossed her lips before she pulled out of the parking space, her eyes focused straight ahead. We drove in silence for a while, the tension in the car almost palpable. I could feel my heart pounding as we left the familiar streets behind, heading toward the outskirts of town. We were meeting Lex, the guy Bianca had contacted, in an abandoned lot near the old church. The place was deserted, far enough from prying eyes to ensure that our conversation wouldn't be overheard.\nAfter about twenty minutes, we turned onto a dirt road that led to a clearing surrounded by trees. The old church loomed in the distance, its shadow stretching across the lot like a silent witness to whatever deals were struck here. As we pulled in, I noticed a dark figure leaning casually against his car, his arms crossed, watching us approach. Lex.\nBianca killed the engine and got out, and I followed her, trying to keep my expression cool and confident. Lex straightened as we approached, his eyes glinting with interest. He was tall, with a lean frame and an air of quiet menace that told me he was no stranger to doing the dirty work others avoided.\n\"Ladies,\" he greeted, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. \"Right on time.\"\nBianca wasted no time with pleasantries. \"Let's get down to business,\" she said, her tone firm. \"You know why we're here, Lex.\"\nHe nodded, glancing between us with an amused look. \"Getting rid of a problem, huh?\" He crossed his arms, leaning back against his car as if he had all the time in the world. \"You two must really want this girl out of the picture.\"\n\"You have no idea,\" I replied, my voice colder than I intended. Lia had been a thorn in my side for far too long, her presence making everything more complicated than it needed to be. She didn't belong in our lives, and she certainly didn't deserve Finn.\nLex chuckled, clearly unfazed. \"Well, you've come to the right guy. I know exactly how to make problems like her disappear.\"\nBianca's eyes narrowed. \"So, what's your plan?\"\nLex leaned in, his voice lowering. \"I'll take care of her on the day of the wedding. That way, no one will suspect a thing. There'll be enough chaos that she'll just slip through the cracks, so to speak.\"\nBianca and I exchanged a look, a mutual understanding passing between us. Lex's plan made sense. The wedding would provide the perfect cover; with all the guests and the confusion, Lia's disappearance would go unnoticed until it was far too late.\n\"Are you sure you can handle it?\" I asked, wanting to be absolutely certain. \"I don't want any loose ends. This has to be clean.\"\nLex gave me a slow, confident smile. \"Relax, Jenny. This isn't my first job. Once I'm done, she'll be nothing more than a memory.\" He glanced at Bianca. \"All you two have to do is act normal. Leave everything else to me.\"\nBianca's expression softened a hint of satisfaction in her eyes. \"Perfect. Make sure she's gone by the time the ceremony begins. We can't afford any surprises.\"\nLex nodded, his face serious now. \"Consider it done. She'll be out of the picture by the time you say 'I do.'\"\nA twisted sense of relief washed over me as I listened to him. Finally, after all the frustration and uncertainty, things were falling into place. Lia would no longer be an obstacle, and I would finally have the life I'd been waiting for.\nWe shook hands with Lex, sealing our silent agreement. Without another word, he slipped back into his car, the engine roaring to life as he drove off, leaving a cloud of dust in his wake. Bianca and I watched him go, each of us lost in our own thoughts.\nAs we got back into her car, Bianca looked over at me, her eyes glinting with satisfaction. \"It's almost done, Jenny. Just a little longer, and everything will be perfect.\"\nI smiled, the anticipation building inside me. \"It's about time. She won't know what hit her.\"\nBianca gave a short, sharp laugh, and we pulled away from the lot, our plan firmly set in motion.\n___\nLuca's POV\nI'd been watching them for a while, lurking in the shadows of the car park. It had taken some time to piece together the threads of Bianca's plan, but I had enough by now to be sure of one thing-she was planning something dangerous, and Lia was her target.\nI saw Bianca and Jenny walking briskly toward a car, their expressions tense and focused. My instincts flared, sensing trouble. This wasn't an ordinary drive-they were on their way to do something. As they got into Bianca's car and drove off, I followed at a safe distance. A few minutes later, they arrived at a remote lot, a clearing I recognized from around the old church. My heart clenched as another figure came into view-a man leaning casually against his car, waiting for them.\nThe moment they stepped out to greet him, I felt my blood run cold. This wasn't a friendly catch-up. No, the look in their eyes and the stiffness of their postures spoke of something darker. I waited in the cover of trees, out of sight but close enough to catch fragments of their conversation. Just as I suspected, they were plotting against Lia. I barely restrained myself, my fingers curling into fists. But I forced myself to stay still and wait until they were finished.\nEventually, Bianca and Jenny walked back to their car, satisfied looks on their faces, and drove off, leaving the man alone in the lot. The guy seemed in no hurry to leave, taking his time as he got back into his car. This was my chance. Staying far enough behind so he wouldn't notice me, I followed him as he pulled onto the road, my senses sharpened and every nerve on edge.\nHe led me on a winding drive through back streets and quiet lanes, finally heading out to a more deserted part of town. When he turned down a narrow dirt road, I took my chance. Leaving my car behind, I shifted into my wolf form, letting my senses take over as I moved swiftly and silently, closing the distance with each step. The trees and night air seemed to blur around me as I surged forward, my focus locked on him, every sense attuned to his every move.\nHe pulled over near an abandoned warehouse, stepped out of his car, and headed toward the side entrance. In one quick, fluid motion, I shifted back to human form, striding out from the shadows and cutting off his path.\nHe froze, his eyes widening as he registered my presence. \"Who the hell are you?\" he asked, his voice a mixture of surprise and irritation.\nI took a step closer, my voice low and dangerous. \"Let's just say I'm someone who knows you're working with Bianca and Jenny. And I know exactly what you're planning to do.\"\nA flicker of recognition crossed his face, followed by a wary look. \"Look, I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said, attempting to sidestep me, but I blocked his path easily.\n\"Don't play games with me,\" I growled, my voice dropping to a deadly tone. \"I know you're planning something against Lia. And I know they've hired you to make her disappear. So I'll make this simple-either you tell me exactly what they want you to do, or you'll regret not cooperating.\"\nHe swallowed, his confidence fading as he realized he was cornered. \"Listen, I don't want any trouble,\" he said, his tone softening. \"I was just hired to do a job. I didn't know there'd be this much interest.\"\n\"Spare me the excuses,\" I replied sharply. \"What's the plan?\"\nAfter a tense pause, he sighed, looking down at the ground before meeting my gaze again. \"The plan is simple. I was supposed to make sure Lia didn't make it to the wedding. Disappear her in a way that wouldn't raise suspicion until it's too late.\"\nMy jaw clenched as anger surged through me, but I forced myself to keep calm. \"You're going to forget that plan. You're going to help me instead.\"\nHe gave me a wary look, frowning. \"Help you? Why would I-\"\n\"Because if you don't, I'll make sure you're the one who disappears. I don't think Bianca or Jenny will care if you're gone.\" My voice was cold, each word laced with warning. \"So here's what we're going to do: you're going to meet with me tomorrow. We're going to figure out a way to make this work in our favor, without harming Lia.\"\nHe looked at me, his expression conflicted. I could see him calculating, trying to decide whether to take the deal or take his chances. But in the end, he nodded.\n\"All right,\" he said, his voice quiet but resigned. \"Tomorrow. Just don't make me regret this.\"\n\"You won't,\" I replied. \"But if you betray me, I promise you won't be around to regret anything.\"\nWith that, I turned and left him standing there, his face pale and uncertain. As I disappeared into the night, my thoughts were focused on one thing: Lia. Whatever Bianca and Jenny were planning, I would stop it. No matter what.\n115\nLia's POV\nI sat in the quiet of the room, the hum of the evening around me when the sudden ring of my phone broke the stillness. I glanced at the screen, and my heart skipped a beat-Luca.\nI answered immediately. \"Luca?\"\n\"Lia,\" his voice was low, serious, the usual warmth missing. \"You need to be careful around Finn's house. Things aren't as they seem, and there's more going on than you know. I'll tell you everything when we see each other. But for now, watch yourself, especially around Bianca and Jenny.\"\nI frowned, my grip tightening on the phone. \"What's going on, Luca? Why should I be worried about them?\"\n\"You'll understand soon enough,\" he said, his voice darkening. \"Just don't trust anyone too easily.\"\nBefore I could ask more, the line clicked and the call ended abruptly, leaving me with an unsettling feeling. What had he meant? I wasn't sure, but I trusted Luca, so I knew I needed to be cautious. Still, I couldn't let his warnings consume me.\nI exhaled slowly, trying to shake off the tension. I dialed Benedicta's number next, hoping for some semblance of calm. It only rang once before she picked up.\n\"Lia?\" Benedicta's voice was always a comforting balm to my nerves.\n\"Hi, Benedicta. I just wanted to check-in. How are you?\" I asked, settling back against the pillows, feeling the weight of the day pressing down on me.\n\"We're doing well,\" she said softly. \"Merlin's been keeping busy. He's grown so much, Lia. I wish you could see him more often.\"\nI smiled at the mention of her son. \"I miss him too. Put him on, will you?\"\nThere was a soft shuffle on the other end before Merlin's voice came through, a little clearer than before.\n\"Lia!\" he said enthusiastically. \"I'm building a castle with my blocks! I bet it's bigger than yours.\"\nI couldn't help but laugh. \"I'll have to come over and see it one of these days. Maybe you can teach me how to build one too.\"\nHe giggled, and I could hear him proudly explain the castle's walls and towers in great detail. The conversation drifted to his plans for the upcoming summer and his excitement about a new book he was reading, and I indulged him, feeling a small sense of peace as I listened to his innocent chatter.\nFinally, after a few more moments, I said, \"Alright, Merlin, I've got to let you go now, but I'll be thinking about that castle.\"\n\"Okay, Lia. See you soon!\" he said before the line went quiet, and I was left with the sound of Benedicta's voice again.\n\"I'll let you go too, dear. Be careful. You never know what's out there.\"\n\"I will,\" I assured her, though my mind wasn't entirely at ease. \"Thanks, Benedicta. Give my love to Merlin.\"\nAfter hanging up, I stared at my phone for a moment before the soft knock on my door pulled me from my thoughts.\nA maid stood in the doorway, her expression respectful but firm. \"Miss Lia, dinner is ready. Your family is waiting downstairs.\"\nI nodded, setting the phone down, and stood up. \"Thank you,\" I said, smoothing out my dress as I followed her down the stairs.\nThe dinner table was set in the grand dining room, a beautiful spread laid out before us. Finn sat at the head of the table, his sister, Alina, seated to his left, and Bianca sitting beside me. There was an awkward tension hanging in the air, one that I couldn't quite place. As I settled into my seat, I glanced at Finn, but he was already looking away, his attention elsewhere.\nI decided to break the silence. \"So, Finn, the wedding preparations are moving along,\" I began casually, hoping to engage him. \"I've been working with the florist, and the venue's almost confirmed. It's all coming together nicely.\"\nFinn barely looked up, his gaze flickering to his plate before returning to his glass of water. \"That's great,\" he muttered, his voice distant.\nI raised an eyebrow but pushed forward, unfazed. \"I was thinking we could start planning the rehearsal dinner soon, too. A few close friends, family, and of course, a few of your business partners. It'll be a good chance to get everyone in the right mood for the wedding day.\"\nStill, Finn didn't seem particularly engaged. He merely nodded, his fork picking at his food as his sister, Alina exchanged an amused glance with Bianca. I didn't care, though. I wasn't here to talk about anything else but our wedding. If Finn wasn't interested, it was his problem.\n\"Well, I've also been thinking about the guest list,\" I continued, feeling my pulse quicken with the desire to push his buttons. \"It's always difficult to narrow it down, especially since your father has so many colleagues and people from the business world that he wants to invite. But I suppose it's a matter of managing expectations, isn't it?\"\nFinn finally glanced up, his eyes narrowing. \"Yes,\" he said slowly, but his tone remained disinterested.\nI felt a flash of frustration but kept my smile in place. It didn't matter if Finn didn't care. This wedding was happening, and he had no say in how it would unfold.\nAfter a few more uncomfortable moments of silence, dinner came to an end. I pushed my chair back, ready to make my next move.\n\"I'd like to speak with you in your office, Finn,\" I said, standing up from the table.\nHis eyes shot to me, but instead of responding immediately, he exchanged a look with Bianca, who raised an eyebrow in return. Alina, too, seemed to be caught off guard by my request. But neither of them said a word.\n\"Alright,\" Finn said after a beat, his voice flat. \"I'll meet you there.\"\nAs I turned to leave, I couldn't help but feel the weight of their gaze following me. What were they thinking? What were they hiding? I would find out soon enough.\n116\nFinn's POV\nI watched as Lia left the dining room, her back straight, movements calm, as though she were completely in control. But I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more beneath that carefully crafted composure. Why did she want to see me in my office? I felt a faint pulse of suspicion as I stood up, unable to ignore the tension that lingered between us tonight.\nJust as I took a step to follow her, Alina approached, her expression a mix of worry and frustration. She lowered her voice, glancing briefly in the direction Lia had disappeared to make sure she was out of earshot. \"Finn, you need to be smart about this,\" she murmured, her tone sharp. \"Your so-called fiancée isn't who you think she is.\"\nI frowned, my gaze hardening as I looked at her. \"What are you talking about, Alina?\"\n\"Lia has her own agenda. I don't trust her, and neither should you.\" Her eyes flickered with something close to desperation as if she'd been holding back these thoughts for far too long. \"Just be careful.\"\nBefore I could respond, Bianca chimed in, her voice filled with quiet resentment. \"She's right, Finn. Don't let Lia brainwash you into whatever game she's playing. I don't know what she's planning, but don't be foolish about it.\"\nI glanced between the two of them, irritation starting to bubble up. \"Bianca,\" I warned, but she didn't stop.\n\"I mean it,\" she pressed, her tone urgent. \"Whatever Lia's about to tell you, don't just take her words at face value. Think, Finn.\"\nAlina turned to her, her eyes narrowing. \"Will you shut up, Bianca? No one asked for your opinion.\"\nBianca stiffened, her eyes flashing with anger. \"Excuse me? I'm only looking out for him, which is more than I can say for you.\"\nAlina's face darkened, her lips pressing into a thin line. \"Don't think for a second you know what's best for my brother. I'm his family, not you.\"\nIt was obvious that they were moments away from launching into a full-blown argument. I let out an exasperated sigh, pinching the bridge of my nose as their voices escalated. \"Enough,\" I snapped, glancing between them with a hardened expression. \"Both of you, just shut up.\"\nThey fell silent, each of them casting me a sullen look but refraining from saying more. I turned away without another word, the tension between them left unresolved but, for the moment, contained.\nAs I walked down the hallway toward my office, Alina's words echoed in my mind, stirring up a sense of unease. Lia isn't who you think she is. I had always trusted Alina's instincts, and she rarely warned me without reason. But Bianca's words lingered, too. Had Lia been attempting to manipulate me, subtly guiding things to her advantage?\nI reached the door to my office and paused, taking a deep breath to compose myself before I walked in to face her. Whatever Lia had to say, I'd hear her out. But I'd keep my guard up this time.\n____\nLia's POV\nI sat in Finn's office, my hands resting on the armrests, eyes fixed on the door as I waited. The ticking of the clock on the wall was loud in the silence, each second stretching out longer than it should. The tension from dinner still hung over me, but I kept my face carefully composed, my posture steady. This was something I needed to confront, and no matter how it turned out, I wasn't going to back down.\nThe door opened, and Finn walked in, closing it behind him with a quiet click. He looked at me, his expression unreadable. \"Why did you want to see me, Lia?\"\nI took a slow breath, meeting his gaze. \"I wanted to talk to you about something I've noticed.\" I paused, choosing my words carefully, watching his face. \"I know you had me followed, Finn.\"\nFor a moment, his expression didn't change, but I saw a flicker of something in his eyes. \"And why do you think that?\" he asked, his tone guarded.\nI raised an eyebrow, leaning forward just a little. \"Because it's obvious,\" I replied, keeping my voice calm. \"You don't trust me, so you need someone to keep an eye on me. You need to soothe your conscience, I suppose.\" I watched him carefully, seeing the faint tension in his shoulders as he stood there, unmoving. \"Am I right?\"\nHe didn't immediately answer, and I could see he was trying to choose his words, weighing how much he wanted to reveal. But I didn't let him speak before I continued, my voice softening just a bit. \"Finn, tomorrow we're supposed to be married. I don't want to start that",

        "title": "Chapter 97",
        "content": "chapter of our lives without any trust between us.\" I tilted my head slightly, watching him, searching for a reaction. \"Don't you think, at the very least, I deserve that? Some trust?\"\nFinn looked at me, his expression still hard, but there was something in his eyes-hesitation, perhaps? He shifted slightly as if struggling to find the right response. I waited, feeling the quiet tension building between us. Whatever he said next would matter.\nBut just as he opened his mouth to reply, his phone buzzed loudly in his pocket. He glanced down, frowning as he looked at the screen. Then, without a word, he walked quickly to the door.\n\"Finn?\" I called, a trace of irritation slipping into my voice. \"What's going on?\"\nHe paused, his hand on the door handle, looking back at me with a tense expression. \"The phone that was left at the gate,\" he said, his tone low, \"we've just received a signal from it. We're going to need to figure out who it belongs to.\"\n\"What? Are you sure it's not for a random person,? I mean,, who'd leave his or her phone there?\"  I asked, my heart racing. What if he finds out it's for Luca?\n\"You seem bothered, what's wrong?\" He asked as I sighed.\n\"I don't just want any troubles tomorrow, it means a lot to me. That's all.\" With that, I walked out of his office.\n117\nLia's POV\nAs I walked to my room, trying to gather my thoughts, I nearly collided with Alina in the hallway. Her expression was colder than usual, her eyes scanning me like she was searching for something hidden.\n\"Why are you acting so suspicious, Lia?\" Alina's voice was sharp, cutting through the silence with an edge that made my skin prickle.\nI met her gaze steadily, not willing to let her see any hint of unease. \"Not tonight, Alina. I'm not in the mood to trade words,\" I replied, brushing past her with forced calm. \"I need to get some rest.\" I could feel her eyes lingering on me as I walked away, but I didn't dare look back. Let her think whatever she wanted. Right now, I have bigger issues to handle.\nFinally, in the privacy of my room, I leaned against the door, exhaling a breath I didn't realize I'd been holding. My mind raced back to the tense conversation with Finn earlier. I couldn't believe he'd had me followed, but I had to keep my reaction controlled. Every second of every interaction felt like I was stepping on a minefield. Just one wrong step, and everything could blow up.\nWithout another thought, I grabbed my phone and quickly dialed Luca's number. He picked up after a few rings.\n\"Luca,\" I whispered urgently, trying to keep my voice steady. \"Finn's found a signal on the phone. They're tracking it right now. If they figure out the phone belongs to you-and that I was the last person who called-I'll be in serious trouble. This whole plan will fall apart.\"\nThere was a pause on the other end, and then his calm voice came through, reassuring. \"Don't worry, Lia. I've got it under control. I'll handle this on my end. Just keep your head down and stay calm. And keep an eye out for anything suspicious. I'll make sure they can't trace it back to me-or to you.\"\nRelief washed over me, but a tension still lingered. \"Alright, I trust you. I'll keep you updated if anything changes.\"\nI hung up, but the tension remained coiled in my chest, making it impossible to sit still. Pacing back and forth in my room only fueled my nerves, so I left, letting my feet guide me down the hall until I reached the CCTV room. I peeked inside and found Finn, along with a few other men, gathered around a screen. Their expressions were intense, brows furrowed in concentration as they worked to crack the phone's code.\nTrying to maintain my composure, I pushed open the door and stepped inside, drawing their attention.\n\"What's going on here?\" I asked, aiming for a casual tone as I approached Finn.\nHe barely glanced at me, his attention fixed on the screen. \"We're trying to access the phone's contacts,\" he replied, his voice distracted. \"Whoever owns this is putting up quite a fight, but we'll get through eventually.\"\nBefore I could respond, Bianca appeared in the doorway, her eyes flashing with interest. She looked at me for a brief moment, a hint of smugness in her expression, before shifting her focus back to the men at the monitor. She seemed almost too eager to see what they'd uncover.\n\"Bianca, don't you have something better to do?\" I said, unable to mask the bite in my tone.\nShe smirked, folding her arms. \"Oh, I wouldn't miss this for the world. Something tells me it's going to be enlightening.\" Her gaze lingered on me, and I had to force myself to keep my expression neutral.\nJust then, one of the technicians spoke up. \"We're getting closer, sir,\" he said to Finn. \"The firewall's tough, but I think we've cracked the first layer. We should have access to the contact list soon.\"\nA chill ran down my spine as I watched Finn nod approvingly. I needed to find a way to keep them from identifying that phone. Luca was doing what he could on his end, but if these men managed to break through...\n\"What kind of firewall blocks a simple contact list?\" I asked, keeping my voice light but genuinely curious. I needed to understand how far they'd get.\n\"An intentional one,\" Finn replied, his tone sharp, his gaze finally turning to me. \"Whoever owns this phone clearly has something to hide. And I intend to find out what that is.\"\nI forced a laugh. \"Well, good luck with that, then. I can't imagine who'd go through so much trouble for a simple phone.\"\nThe technician looked up, smirking. \"People hide things in the most unexpected places.\"\nBianca's smirk only grew, and she leaned closer to Finn. \"Imagine what kind of secrets this phone holds and whose secrets.\" Her gaze flicked to me briefly, a subtle accusation in her eyes, like she was daring me to react.\nI wanted to respond, to wipe that look off her face, but I held back. Drawing more attention to myself would only make things worse. Instead, I crossed my arms and shrugged. \"Well, I guess I'll leave you to your little detective work. Hope you find something worthwhile.\"\nI turned on my heel and made my way out of the CCTV room, my heart pounding in my chest. I needed to think, needed to stay one step ahead of them.\n____\nBianca's POV\nAs I watched Finn study the screen with that single-minded intensity, I couldn't help the irritation bubbling up inside me. He was so determined to protect Lia, so blinded by whatever strange loyalty he thought he owed her. But he needed to see reason, and if he wouldn't come to his senses, I'd bring him there myself.\nTaking a steadying breath, I leaned closer to him, lowering my voice so that only he would hear. \"Finn,\" I said carefully, \"don't you think the owner of this phone may be a spy? Someone within our clan could be betraying us.\"\nHe barely glanced at me, his jaw clenched. I could see he was holding onto his calm with a thin thread, and it only pushed me to continue.\n\"Think about it,\" I went on, my voice almost a whisper now. \"Lia isn't from our clan. She's an outsider-and it's possible, Finn, very possible, that she's here to betray us.\" I let the words hang between us, waiting for him to process, to see the truth of it.\nBut his reaction wasn't what I expected. His gaze snapped to me, his eyes icy and unyielding. \"Enough, Bianca. I don't want to hear this nonsense,\" he said sharply, his voice dripping with barely contained annoyance. \"I trust Lia.\"\nA stab of anger and frustration flared in me, but I hid it behind a sweet smile. \"I'm only saying this for your own good, Finn. You've always trusted people too easily.\"\n\"I trust people who earn it, Bianca,\" he retorted, his voice steely. \"And Lia has. Now, if you don't have anything useful to say, get out.\"\nHis words stung, like a slap across the face, but I wasn't about to let him see how much they affected me. I simply offered him a tight, polite smile, masking the irritation simmering beneath my skin. \"As you wish, Finn. I'm just looking out for you,\" I murmured, trying to maintain an air of calm.\nBut as I left his office, the smile faded from my lips, replaced by a fierce scowl. How could he be so blind, so easily manipulated by that woman? I knew Lia was hiding something, and if Finn couldn't see it, then I would make him.\nI pulled out my phone, my fingers moving quickly as I dialed Lex's number. It rang once, twice, before he picked up, his voice low and gruff.\n\"Bianca. What's going on?\"\n\"We need to meet tomorrow, but it has to be earlier than we planned,\" I replied, my voice hard. \"This situation with Lia is getting out of hand, and I can't wait any longer. We need to get rid of her as soon as possible.\"\nThere was a pause on the other end, then a chuckle, low and amused. \"Impatient, are we?\"\n\"This isn't a joke, Lex,\" I snapped, irritation flaring again. \"Lia is dangerous. She's twisting Finn around her finger, and I'm not going to stand by and watch her ruin everything we've worked for.\"\nLex's tone shifted, becoming more serious. \"Fine. Where do you want to meet?\"\nI glanced around the hallway to ensure no one was within earshot before replying. \"Let's keep it discreet. I'll text you the details.\"\n\"Understood,\" he replied, his voice a mix of amusement and determination. \"But Bianca, remember-taking Lia out won't be easy. Finn will notice if anything happens to her.\"\nI clenched my teeth, my free hand curling into a fist. \"I know that, Lex. But I'll deal with Finn when the time comes. Right now, Lia is the priority. We can't let her stay.\"\n\"Fine,\" he agreed. \"Text me the place. And Bianca-don't do anything rash. We need to handle this smartly.\"\n\"Of course,\" I replied, ending the call. Smart, yes-but also decisively. Lia had underestimated me, thinking she could just walk into Finn's life and take over. She had no idea what I was capable of.\nAs I put my phone away, a thrill of satisfaction surged through me. Lia wouldn't be a problem much longer, and once she was gone, Finn would finally see things clearly. I could be patient when it mattered. And when this was over, I'd make sure Finn understood that I'd done it all for him, for our future.\nWith a sense of determination, I walked back down the hallway, my mind already spinning with possibilities. By tomorrow, this entire game Lia was playing would be over. And when she was out of the way, I'd make sure she was forgotten-like the unimportant pawn she truly was.\n118\nLia's POV\nAs soon as I closed the door behind me, I hurried across the room, grabbing my phone from the nightstand. My heart raced as I dialed Luca's number, silently urging him to pick up quickly. The line clicked, and his familiar voice sounded in my ear.\n\"Lia, what's wrong?\"\nI didn't waste any time. \"Luca, things are getting complicated. Right now, Finn is trying to track down the owner of that phone-the one I left at the gate. If he figures out it's yours I'll be in serious trouble. And Bianca's helping him. I'm sure she'll try to pin everything on me.\"\nThere was a pause on Luca's end before he replied, his voice calm and reassuring. \"Don't worry. I've taken care of it. They won't be able to get anything from that phone, trust me. No one will trace it back to me.\"\nHis words brought a flicker of relief, but I still felt the weight of everything pressing down on me. \"Are you sure?\" I pressed, needing more than just his word. \"Because if Finn finds out\"\n\"Lia,\" he interrupted, his tone firm. \"I promise, nothing will come of this. No one will find anything, and if they do, it won't point to you. Now listen to me.\" He paused as if making sure I was fully focused. \"We need to meet tomorrow. There are some things I need you to do, and once you follow through, everything will go as planned.\"\nI hesitated, feeling the enormity of it all settle over me. But I knew there was no turning back. Not now, not after everything I'd put into this.\n\"Alright,\" I murmured, taking a deep breath. \"But Luca, I want to make one thing clear-I'm not ending this marriage. I'm going through with it. I'll be marrying Finn tomorrow, no matter what.\"\nThere was a brief silence, then a low chuckle from Luca. \"Of course. That's exactly what I want. Marrying Finn will only work to our advantage. You need to be by his side for this plan to succeed. So go ahead, get married to him. It's all part of what we need to do.\"\nHis approval only added fuel to the fire simmering inside me. For so long, I'd played my role, staying patient, waiting for the perfect moment to turn the tables. Now, that moment was finally here. I was done being a bystander in my own life.\n\"Fine,\" I replied, determination settling in my voice. \"We'll meet tomorrow, just tell me where.\"\n\"A café,\" he answered smoothly. \"I'll text you the location. We'll talk, and I'll go over what you need to do. Just make sure you don't leave any loose ends behind.\"\n\"I won't,\" I assured him. \"And thank you for handling this.\"\n\"Don't mention it,\" he said, his voice softening just a fraction. \"Remember, Lia, we're in this together. Everything is under control.\"\nThe line went silent as he hung up, and I put my phone down, exhaling deeply. I felt an odd calm settle over me, even with the whirlwind of everything that was happening. If Luca was confident, then I had to be too.\nI paced the room, unable to stay still. My mind was spinning, thoughts tangled with emotions. Marrying Finn had never been about love or loyalty, but about taking control, about making sure I came out of this on top. It was my turn to hold the power, and I wasn't going to let anything-or anyone-take that away.\nAfter a few moments, the walls of the room started to feel suffocating. I needed to clear my head, to walk off the tension curling inside me. So I slipped out of my room, walking down the dim hallway until I found myself standing near the CCTV room.\nThe faint sounds of voices drew me closer, and as I peered inside, I saw Finn hunched over a monitor, frustration etched across his face. He was flanked by two other men, all of them working on the phone, trying to crack whatever was left of it.\nI leaned casually against the doorframe, clearing my throat. Finn glanced up, his expression shifting as he saw me.\n\"What's going on?\" I asked, feigning a look of mild curiosity.\n\"We're trying to access the numbers,\" Finn replied, his voice strained. \"But it seems like the owner's blocking us somehow. There's nothing to trace.\"\nI nodded, masking the relief that surged through me. Just then, Bianca walked into the room, her face twisting into a scowl as she caught sight of me. Ignoring her, I offered Finn a small smile.\n\"Good luck with that,\" I said, my tone casual. \"Let me know if you need any help.\"\nWithout waiting for a response, I turned on my heel and walked away, leaving them to their frustrated attempts. As I walked back to my room, a sense of satisfaction washed over me. Let them try all they wanted-Luca had made sure they wouldn't find anything. Tomorrow, I'd marry Finn, and my plan would unfold exactly as it was meant to.\nEverything was falling into place, and for the first time in a long time, I felt like I was finally in control.\n___\nAlina's POV\nI sat alone in my bedroom, the dim light from the lamp casting soft shadows around me. My thoughts circled like vultures, picking apart every detail of the situation unfolding around me. That phone was left at the gate it was suspicious enough on its own. But now, Finn was rushing into a marriage with Lia, someone who had always felt like an outsider. Something about all of this didn't sit right with me.\nI tapped my fingers against the arm of the chair, frustration bubbling up. It was impossible not to see how strange this was-this sudden marriage, Finn's stubborn trust in Lia, even with all the secrecy swirling around her. If only he could see her the way I did.\nA knock at the door broke through my thoughts, and I glanced up as one of the maids stepped inside, bowing her head slightly in respect.\n\"Ma'am, you called for me?\" she asked, her voice soft.\n\"Yes,\" I said, my gaze sharp as I looked her over. This maid was discreet, one of the more trustworthy ones, and I needed someone who would be thorough. \"I have some instructions for you, and I need you to follow them exactly as I say.\"\nShe nodded quickly, standing straighter, clearly sensing the gravity of the task I was about to give her.\n\"From this moment on, you're to watch Lia closely. I want to know everything she does, every room she enters, every conversation she has. And make sure you pay attention to Finn as well. I need you to keep track of their interactions and report them all to me. Do you understand?\"\nThe maid nodded again, her expression serious. \"Yes, ma'am.\"\nI leaned forward, my voice lowering. \"This is particularly important regarding that phone they found. I need to know the outcome of that investigation. Finn is digging around for answers, and I have a feeling that Lia knows more than she's letting on. If there's anything suspicious, I want to be the first to know. Understood?\"\nThe maid's eyes widened slightly, but she nodded with steady determination. \"I understand, ma'am. I'll do exactly as you say.\"\n\"Good,\" I said, satisfied with her response. \"And remember, I want updates regularly. Anything you see, no matter how small, report it to me immediately. Don't let anything slip by.\"\nI watched as she absorbed my words, her face serious and attentive. I needed someone loyal, someone who wouldn't be swayed by Finn's charming ways or Lia's manipulative front. This maid had been with us long enough to understand that my orders weren't up for negotiation.\n\"Also,\" I added, \"be cautious. I don't want anyone noticing that you're keeping tabs on them. Discretion is crucial. If they realize you're watching, they'll change their behavior, and then we'll lose any advantage we have.\"\nShe nodded again. \"I understand, ma'am. I'll be careful.\"\nWith a final glance, I motioned toward the door. \"That will be all. You can go now.\"\nThe maid gave a small bow before slipping out of the room, leaving me alone once more. I leaned back in my chair, staring off into the distance as the wheels of my mind turned. This entire situation was infuriating. Ever since Lia had come into our lives, things had been thrown off balance. Finn was behaving recklessly, blindsided by his so-called \"trust\" in her, while Lia seemed to be weaving herself deeper into his life every day.\nAnd now, a marriage-just like that, without any consideration for the rest of us. If it were up to me, I would have put a stop to this nonsense the moment she showed her true colors. But Finn's stubbornness and arrogance were a constant roadblock. He never saw the full picture, the way I did.\nStill, I wasn't about to sit idly by. This maid would be my eyes and ears, and I would be one step ahead of Lia at every turn. It wouldn't be long before her secrets unraveled. I'd find out what she was hiding, and I'd make sure Finn saw her for what she truly was.\nThere was too much at stake to let this slide. Our family's reputation, our legacy-it all mattered far more than Lia's petty ambitions. She thought she could manipulate her way to the top, but I would make sure she fell just as quickly. She was nothing but a temporary storm, a fleeting problem that would be dealt with soon enough.\nI stood up, crossing the room to the window, gazing out into the night. Somewhere out there, Lia was probably plotting her next move, thinking she had everything under control. But she underestimated me. No one waltzed into this family without my permission, and certainly, no one played my brother like a pawn.\nSoon enough, I'd have her exactly where I wanted her. And when the time was right, I'd make sure she regretted every deceitful step she took toward this family.\nWith a final look at the empty hallway, I allowed myself a small, satisfied smile. Whatever games Lia was playing, she'd soon learn that I was two steps ahead. And when the truth finally came to light, I would be there to watch it all unfold.\n119\nLia's POV \nThe night pressed heavily around me as I returned to my room, my mind racing. The events of the evening still churned within me, and I knew that Finn's interest in tracking down the phone's owner wouldn't just vanish. This marriage was supposed to bring stability and security even, but it felt more like a house of cards, ready to collapse with one wrong move.\nI paced the room, waiting, hoping the tension would ease, but every second felt like the walls were closing in. Finally, I grabbed my phone and dialed Luca, pressing the receiver tight against my ear as it rang. His voice was steady and firm, instantly grounding me.\n\"What's wrong, Lia?\" he asked, sensing my tension.\n\"It's Finn,\" I whispered, glancing over my shoulder, though I knew the door was locked. \"He's looking into the phone that was left at the gate. He's got people working on it right now, and Bianca is right there with him. If they uncover anything about you\" My voice faltered, dread seeping in.\nLuca's voice didn't waver. \"Lia, listen to me. I told you, everything is under control. I've set up every safeguard. Even if Finn digs, he won't find anything that ties back to us. Trust me.\"\nA shaky sigh escaped me. \"But if they get even the smallest hint of my connection to you, it's over. Finn isn't stupid-he'll put the pieces together.\"\n\"Let them look,\" he said calmly. \"What they'll find will lead them nowhere. Remember, I planned for this.\"\nHis confidence was reassuring, but I couldn't shake the gnawing feeling that something was bound to slip. \"We're meeting tomorrow at the café, right?\"\n\"Yes,\" he confirmed. \"I'll go over the next steps with you then. And, Lia-whatever happens, stick to the plan. Marrying Finn works in our favor, even if it doesn't feel like it now.\"\nThe words calmed me, even as doubt simmered beneath the surface. \"Fine. I'll see you tomorrow.\"\nWe ended the call, but my mind continued to spin. I sat at the edge of my bed, running over everything in my head. Finn was too close, and if Bianca's suspicions fanned the flames, I'd have even less time to secure my place here.\nUnable to sit still, I wandered the halls, my footsteps soft against the cold marble floors. Passing the CCTV room, I paused. Curiosity pulled me closer. The door was slightly ajar, and I could hear murmurs from inside. Peering in, I saw Finn and two of his men, focused intently on a screen displaying the phone's data.\nA small spark of panic flared. If they got through even a sliver of Luca's defenses, everything would unravel.\nSteeling myself, I walked in, masking my nerves with a calm expression. Finn glanced up, momentarily surprised but quickly regaining his composure.\n\"What's going on?\" I asked, keeping my tone light.\n\"We're still working on retrieving data from the phone,\" he replied, his eyes flickering back to the screen. \"Whoever owns it has done a good job hiding their tracks, but we'll crack it eventually.\"\nI forced a casual smile. \"And you're sure it's worth all this effort?\"\nFinn looked at me, studying my face as if he could peel back my thoughts. \"Absolutely. I don't like loose ends, especially ones that could bring trouble to our doorstep.\"\nBianca suddenly walked in, her eyes flicking between Finn and me before settling on me with a cold stare. She crossed her arms, clearly eager to interject.\n\"I was just telling Finn,\" she said, her tone laced with accusation, \"that whoever owns this phone could be a threat to the clan. And since you're an outsider, Lia, don't you think it's wise to be a bit more cautious about what-or who-you bring around here?\"\nHer words were pointed, like small knives. I held her gaze, refusing to let her intimidation seep through.\n\"I'm marrying into this family tomorrow,\" I said smoothly, keeping my voice even. \"And I'll do whatever it takes to protect Finn and everyone else here. So if you're implying something, Bianca, be direct.\"\nFinn cleared his throat, stepping between us before Bianca could escalate things further. \"That's enough,\" he said, casting Bianca a stern look. \"We don't need to turn on each other. Lia is as invested in this as anyone else here.\"\nBianca looked away, lips pressed into a thin line, clearly irritated by Finn's response.\n\"Well,\" she said sharply, \"just remember that not everyone who enters our lives has our best interests at heart.\" She threw one last glare my way before leaving the room.\nAs soon as she was gone, Finn turned back to me, his gaze softening. \"Don't pay any attention to her. She'soverprotective.\"\nI nodded, trying to play it off with a smile. \"It's fine. I get it. She's family, after all.\"\nHe returned my smile, but his attention was already drifting back to the screen. \"I'll be up late with this, so don't wait up,\" he said, his voice distracted.\nI took the cue and left the room, forcing myself to keep my pace steady down the hall. Inside, my heart was racing. Bianca's suspicions were only growing, and with Finn so close to the truth, I felt like I was standing on thin ice. I'd made it this far, but I knew that from here on, every move would have to be perfect-or everything I'd built would shatter.\nBianca's POV \nOnce I left the CCTV room, my mind was already plotting. Finn's blind faith in Lia was a threat-he couldn't see that his so-called fiancée was the true danger. And I was done watching him walk right into her trap.\nI made my way down the hallway, pulling out my phone as I walked. My contact list popped up, and I scrolled down to Lex's number. Pressing \"call,\" I waited, listening to the ring until he finally picked up.\n\"Bianca,\" he greeted, his voice low and familiar.\n\"We need to meet,\" I said sharply. \"Tomorrow, first thing in the morning. There's something I need you to handle.\"\nA brief silence passed, then he let out a chuckle. \"I take it this is about your new sister-in-law?\"\n\"She's nothing to me,\" I snapped, venom creeping into my tone. \"But she's becoming a problem for Finn. He's too caught up in whatever spell she's woven around him. I want her gone, Lex. And fast.\"\n\"Interesting,\" he mused. \"You think she's a spy?\"\nI glanced around, lowering my voice as I leaned against the wall. \"I know she is. She doesn't belong here, and the sooner she's out of Finn's life, the better.\"\n\"Consider it done, Bianca,\" he replied smoothly. \"Tomorrow, I'll handle everything. Just make sure no one traces it back to us.\"\nI ended the call, satisfaction filling me. Soon enough, Lia would be out of the picture, and I'd have Finn back where he belonged: away from manipulative outsiders and devoted to the clan, where his loyalty should have always stayed.\n120\nLuca's POV \nThe phone buzzed beside me, cutting through the early morning silence. Lex's name flashed on the screen, his call both expected and a bit early. I picked up, his familiar voice coming through before I could even say hello.\n\"Luca, it's time,\" he said, his tone clipped and serious. \"We're meeting with Bianca and Jenny today to finalize everything.\"\n\"Where?\" I asked, already reaching for my coat as I processed the details.\n\"There's a private room at the café near Benedicta's house. It'll be low-key,\" he said. \"Eleven o'clock.\"\nI nodded to myself, feeling a strange sense of calm settle over me. The plan had been in motion for a while now, each piece carefully set. This would be the final check, the last chance to cover any gaps.\n\"Understood,\" I replied, ending the call.\nI dialed Lia's number right away, knowing she'd want to hear the update. The call rang twice before she picked up.\n\"Lia,\" I began, keeping my voice low. \"Listen, I'm meeting with Lex and Bianca later, but I want us to meet right afterward. Come over to Benedicta's house around noon. There are some things we need to discuss.\"\nI could sense her hesitation for a moment, but she eventually agreed, her voice steady. \"I'll be there.\"\nWe ended the call, and I felt a fleeting pang of doubt. Finn was no fool, and Bianca was relentless. If anything went wrong, it wouldn't just be Lia in danger-it'd be all of us. But there was no turning back now. The stakes were too high, and too many of us were in too deep.\nTaking a deep breath, I stepped out of the building and headed for the car park. The morning air was cool, the city just waking up, but my thoughts were already racing as I climbed into my car and started the engine.\nAs I drove, I reviewed everything once more in my head. Bianca's eagerness for this meeting, her insistence on taking Lia down-it all made sense, yet it felt like she was letting emotions cloud her judgment. And Lex was ruthless, but he needed to be in control. As long as I kept things balanced between them, this meeting would go smoothly.\nWithin minutes, I pulled into the parking lot, the café coming into view. I glanced at my watch-still a bit early. I took a steadying breath, knowing the next hour could either seal our success or doom everything.\nBianca's POV \nI sat in the secluded booth at the café, my eyes drifting to the door every few seconds. Jenny sat across from me, her fingers drumming against the tabletop, her expression one of thinly veiled impatience. Lex was the last to arrive, slipping into the booth with a quick nod.\n\"Good, you're both here,\" he said, taking his seat beside me. His gaze was sharp, assessing us both before getting down to business.\n\"This wedding tomorrow-it's our best shot,\" he said, his voice low and controlled. \"We'll take Lia out when everyone's attention is on the ceremony.\"\nJenny nodded, her lips curving in a smirk. \"You mean abduct her,\" she added with a glint of satisfaction in her eyes.\nLex leaned forward, his gaze narrowing. \"Yes, but it has to be discreet. We can't have people asking questions, at least not until we're well out of there. Once we have her, it's game over for her and anyone trying to interfere.\"\nI folded my arms, feeling a dark satisfaction settle over me. \"Lia's become a problem, and Finn can't see it. He's blinded by whatever charm she's managed to weave around him. But once she's out of the picture, he'll come back to his senses. He'll see that she was never one of us.\"\nLex nodded, a faint smile touching his lips. \"That's the plan. The wedding will be chaotic enough; no one will suspect a thing.\"\nJenny leaned forward, her voice a quiet hum of excitement. \"I'll be handling the guests and keeping people occupied. By the time anyone realizes Lia's missing, we'll already have her stashed away.\"\nI glanced at Lex, meeting his gaze. \"And what about Finn? He'll turn the entire place upside down once he realizes she's gone.\"\n\"That's where you come in,\" Lex said, fixing his eyes on me. \"You're family, Bianca. You'll keep him focused, keep him from spiraling out of control. We can't have him getting suspicious too soon, or this entire plan will fall apart.\"\nI gave a curt nod. \"I know Finn better than anyone. I'll make sure he doesn't catch on until it's too late.\"\nA silence settled over the table, each of us letting the weight of the plan sink in. I could feel the tension simmering beneath the surface, the sense that everything we'd worked for was balancing on a razor's edge. But I wasn't about to let some outsider ruin everything. Not after all the years I'd spent keeping Finn safe, keeping the family strong.\n\"Then it's settled,\" Lex said finally, standing up. \"Tomorrow, during the wedding, Lia will disappear. We'll do what's necessary, and Finn will come to his senses. Agreed?\"\nJenny and I both nodded, our gazes meeting with a shared understanding. This was the moment we'd been waiting for.\nAs Lex left the table, Jenny lingered a moment, her gaze flickering toward me. \"You're sure about this, Bianca? If something goes wrong\"\n\"Nothing will go wrong,\" I replied sharply, cutting her off. \"Lia has been a thorn in our side for too long. This is our chance to set things right.\"\nJenny nodded, her expression softening with a glint of approval. \"Then I'll see you tomorrow.\"\nShe slipped away, leaving me alone at the table. I watched her go, the reality of the plan settling over me like a shroud. Tomorrow, Lia would be out of our lives, and Finn would finally understand the truth.\nHe may hate me for it at first, but I'd rather be hated than let him fall victim to someone as dangerous as Lia.\n121\nLia's POV \nAs I walked down the quiet street toward Benedicta's house, a shadow lingered at the edge of my vision, too familiar to ignore. I knew Finn had someone following me; he'd been testing me for days now, trying to catch any hint that I might be hiding something. I could almost feel his eyes, watching from somewhere far behind, questioning my every move. Part of me wanted to turn around, to catch this follower in the act and confront them head-on, but I knew better. Let them watch, let them wonder. It didn't change my plans, not now.\nI reached Benedicta's door and knocked lightly, my mind replaying Luca's instructions. Meet me after the wedding it had sounded easy enough, but Finn's surveillance was making everything twice as complicated. If he suspected anything more than he already did, it wouldn't just be me in trouble; Luca, too, would be caught up in his web. I took a deep breath as Benedicta opened the door, her face lighting up with a small, welcoming smile.\n\"Lia, it's good to see you,\" she greeted, stepping aside to let me in.\nI returned her smile, grateful for a moment of calm. \"You too, Benedicta,\" I said, following her inside. The house felt warm and comforting, a rare refuge from the whirlwind of secrets I'd been caught up in lately.\nWe settled into the cozy living room, where the faint scent of freshly brewed tea hung in the air. Benedicta poured a cup for each of us, and I took a moment to gather my thoughts. I needed answers and reassurance that things were still under control. The plan had felt so clear before, but now with Finn watching so closely, I couldn't shake the uneasy feeling gnawing at the back of my mind.\n\"Benedicta,\" I began, keeping my voice steady, \"do you know why Luca called me here? Why does he want to meet?\"\nBenedicta shook her head, her expression thoughtful. \"He didn't give me any specifics. Just that he needed to speak with you about the plan, to make sure everything was still on track.\"\nI frowned, my fingers tapping against the side of my cup. \"Finn's been watching me closely he even had me followed on my way here. It's clear he doesn't trust me-not yet, anyway.\"\nBenedicta nodded, her gaze softening with understanding. \"Finn's a cautious man. He's always looking for the truth, even if it means doubting the people closest to him. Don't let it discourage you, Lia. He just needs time.\"\nI sighed, running a hand through my hair. \"It's not just about time. He's trying to figure out why I want this marriage so badly, why I'm pushing for it now of all times. He's suspicious, and I can't blame him.\"\nBenedicta placed a reassuring hand on my arm. \"Remember, you're doing this for a reason, and Luca knows that. Whatever Finn may think, he'll come to understand in time. Luca wouldn't call you here if he didn't have a plan in mind.\"\nI bit my lip, my mind still racing with questions. \"It's just the phone,\" I said, my voice dropping. \"Finn's been fixated on finding out who left it at the gate, who the owner might be. If he finds out it's connected to Luca\"\nBenedicta's eyes flickered with concern, but she maintained her calm. \"Don't worry about the phone. Luca's made it clear that he'll handle everything on his end. He wouldn't let anything happen that would jeopardize the plan.\"\nI nodded, trying to take comfort in her words, though a part of me still felt unsettled. Every time I thought we were one step ahead, Finn seemed to close the gap, always just a breath away from uncovering everything.\nBenedicta offered a small, encouraging smile. \"Remember, Lia, we've come this far. You're stronger than you realize, and you've managed to keep Finn in the dark up to this point. Just hold on a little longer. Luca has everything under control, and soon, Finn's suspicions will be the least of your worries.\"\nI smiled, grateful for her support. \"You're right. I just need to focus and stay one step ahead.\"\nBenedicta patted my hand, her gaze filled with warmth and determination. \"Exactly. And whatever happens, just remember that you have people who believe in you. Luca, me we're with you.\"\nA sense of calm washed over me as I took her words to heart. Despite the tension, despite Finn's doubts and the ever-present shadow following me, I felt a renewed sense of purpose. This wasn't just about me anymore; it was about everyone who'd placed their trust in me and who believed that I could pull this off.\nWe sat in comfortable silence for a moment, each lost in our own thoughts. I could feel the weight of what lay ahead, the delicate dance of deception and trust, the high stakes that seemed to grow with every passing day. But for now, I had what I needed-a plan, a purpose, and, most importantly, a small glimmer of hope that, somehow, everything would work out.\nAs I stood to leave, Benedicta gave me a firm nod. \"Stay strong, Lia. Tomorrow is the start of something new, and you'll be ready for whatever comes.\"\nI smiled, grateful beyond words.\n____\nLuca's POV \nI arrived at the dimly lit warehouse, the kind of place where shadows felt at home, merging with the darkness and keeping secrets. Lex was already waiting, leaning casually against a pillar with an air of confidence. He straightened up as I approached, his expression serious and his gaze unflinching.\n\"Luca,\" he greeted with a curt nod.\n\"Lex,\" I replied, mirroring his tone. There wasn't time for pleasantries; we both knew this meeting was about something far more pressing.\nHe cut right to the chase. \"Jenny and Bianca are planning to act soon. They want Lia out of the picture, and they're not wasting any time.\"\nA surge of irritation sparked inside me. I had expected something from Bianca eventually, but not so soon, and certainly not with Jenny involved. \"What exactly is their plan?\" I asked, my tone sharp.\nLex sighed, glancing away for a moment. \"They want to use the wedding as an opportunity to remove Lia. Bianca has this idea to abduct her right after the ceremony, make it look like she disappeared on her own, or like she's involved in something shady. It's all about planting doubts and breaking Finn's trust.\"\nI clenched my fists, feeling the weight of the situation pressing down on me. If Bianca got her way, everything I'd carefully set in motion would come crashing down. Lia was integral to my plan; she needed to be right there by Finn's side, gaining his trust, not vanishing and leaving questions in her wake.\n\"That's not going to happen,\" I said firmly. \"You need to make sure they don't act on any of these plans.\"\nLex arched a brow, his curiosity piqued. \"And how exactly do you want me to handle it?\"\nI took a deep breath, choosing my words carefully. \"For now, keep them in check. Let Bianca and Jenny believe they still have the upper hand. I need you to hold off on any actions until I give you a clear signal. If they feel like they're being watched too closely, they might get suspicious or change tactics.\"\nLex seemed to consider this, crossing his arms as he looked at me. \"So you want me to keep them on a leash, but not stop them completely?\"\n\"Exactly,\" I replied. \"Let them think everything is going as planned. They'll be less likely to make impulsive moves if they think they're still in control. But at the same time, be ready to intervene the moment I say so. Nothing happens unless I give the order.\"\nLex gave a slow nod, understanding dawning in his expression. \"You know, they're not going to take it well if they realize I'm in your pocket.\"\nI smirked, a hint of satisfaction slipping through. \"That's a risk I'm willing to take. You're in a unique position, Lex. You know both sides, and that gives us an advantage. Use it wisely.\"\nHe seemed to weigh my words before finally nodding again. \"Understood. I'll play along and keep them on a leash. But, Luca this is dangerous. One wrong move and this could blow up in our faces.\"\nI met his gaze, holding it with a calm assurance. \"I know the stakes, Lex. But that's why we're doing this carefully. We've come too far to let Bianca ruin it all with her petty schemes. Lia has a role to play, and as long as she's in position, things will go as planned.\"\nLex looked at me, his expression a mix of respect and wariness. \"Fine. I'll hold them off for now. Just make sure you know what you're doing. Bianca's not one to cross lightly, and she's got her sights set on Lia.\"\n\"I'll handle Bianca if it comes to that,\" I assured him. \"Just remember-wait for my signal. Nothing moves without it.\"\nWith that, Lex nodded one last time and walked off, his silhouette quickly blending into the shadows. As I watched him disappear, I felt a grim satisfaction settle over me. Bianca might think she's smart, but she didn't know how many steps ahead I already was. As long as everything went according to plan, this game was mine to win.\n122\nLia's POV \nI sat in Benedicta's cozy living room, the warmth of her home calming the unease simmering in my chest. I tried to focus on the conversation, but my mind kept wandering back to the events of the past few days. I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching me, that every move I made was under a microscope. Finn had to be behind it, of course. He was testing me, trying to see if my intentions were genuine. But did he realize how close he was to the truth?\nBenedicta noticed my distracted expression and placed a comforting hand on my shoulder. \"Lia, don't let it get to you,\" she said gently. \"You're doing everything you can. Remember, this isn't just for you-it's for everyone relying on you. Don't let Bianca or anyone else intimidate you.\"\nI nodded, grateful for her support. Before I could respond, the sound of the front door opening pulled both our gazes toward the entryway. Luca walked in, his face set in a calm, unreadable mask. As he entered the room, I felt a mix of relief and apprehension. I needed answers, but I wasn't sure I was ready for what he might say.\n\"Luca,\" I greeted, standing up. \"Why did you ask me to come here?\"\nHe offered a small, reassuring smile before he glanced briefly at Benedicta. \"I think it's time we talked about everything,\" he said, his tone steady. He gestured for me to sit back down, and as I did, he took a seat across from me, leaning forward with a serious expression.\n\"Lia,\" he began, \"things are happening behind the scenes that you need to be aware of, but you have to act like you know nothing. Bianca and Jenny have been planning something ever since they learned about your engagement to Finn. They think you're in their way, and they're not afraid to play dirty to get you out of the picture.\"\nThe weight of his words sank in, and I felt a chill run down my spine. I knew Bianca had her issues with me, but this was more than I'd expected. \"What are they planning?\" I asked, barely managing to keep my voice steady.\nLuca glanced around as if making sure we were alone. \"They're planning to use your wedding as an opportunity. They want to take you away and and create enough chaos to break any trust Finn might have in you. If they can make him doubt you, it'll be easier for them to get rid of you for good.\"\nMy heart pounded as his words settled in. \"So, they want to ruin everything by making me look like a traitor,\" I murmured, piecing it together. \"If Finn thinks I'm hiding something or working against him, it'll be all over.\"\nLuca nodded. \"That's exactly their goal. But here's the thing: they're working with Lex, who's giving me updates on their plans. He's on our side for now, but you'll need to tread carefully. They can't know you're aware of any of this.\"\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady my thoughts. \"So what do I do?\"\n\"You keep going as if everything is normal,\" Luca replied, his voice firm. \"Don't act differently around Finn, Bianca, or anyone else. Make them believe that you're oblivious. And be careful with Finn. He's already suspicious, watching your every move. The slightest slip-up could give them exactly what they want.\"\n\"Trust me, I know he's watching,\" I muttered. \"He's had someone following me since we got engaged. It's like he's waiting for me to prove him right.\"\nLuca leaned closer, his expression more intense. \"That's why you can't give him any reason to doubt you. Stick to the plan, and when you're with Finn, make it clear that you're serious about this marriage. The more he believes in your loyalty, the harder it'll be for Bianca and Jenny to undermine you.\"\nI glanced at Benedicta, who gave me a reassuring nod. \"He's right, Lia,\" she said gently. \"Stay calm, keep your composure, and don't let them see any fear or hesitation. Remember, you're not alone in this.\"\nI looked back at Luca, feeling a new resolve settling over me. \"Fine. I'll act like I don't know a thing. But I need to be ready if they decide to make a move sooner than we expect.\"\nLuca nodded approvingly. \"Good. And remember, Lex will be keeping an eye on Bianca and Jenny. If anything changes, I'll get the information to you as soon as possible. Just stay cautious.\"\n\"Understood.\" I looked down for a moment, gathering my thoughts, before looking back at him. \"One more thing, Luca. Why are you helping me with all of this? What do you get out of it?\"\nA hint of a smile played on his lips. \"Let's just say I have my own reasons for wanting to see this play out in your favor. There are people in this world who think they can control everything. Bianca is one of them, but she's about to learn that she's not as untouchable as she thinks.\"\nAs his words hung in the air, I felt a surge of confidence. Maybe I wasn't as isolated as I'd thought. With allies like Luca and Benedicta, I stood a chance of navigating this maze of deceit and coming out unscathed.\nI stood up, giving him a firm nod. \"Thank you, Luca. I'll be ready.\"\nWith that, I left Benedicta's house, feeling the weight of his words settle into determination. If Bianca and Jenny thought they could ruin everything, they were in for a surprise.\n___\nJenny's POV \nJenny leaned back in her chair, a smug grin spreading across her face as Bianca paced the small room. They had been going over every detail of their plan for days, and the sense of satisfaction bubbling inside her was hard to contain. \"So, once Finn suspects Lia, it's only a matter of time before he starts questioning her motives,\" she murmured, pleased with how everything was coming together.\nBianca paused and looked at Jenny with a gleam in her eye. \"Exactly. Finn's always been cautious, and with enough nudging, he'll see her for the threat she is. And once he doubts her, he'll throw her out himself. We won't have to lift a finger.\"\nThe two shared a triumphant smile, imagining the chaos they would unleash. Just then, the door swung open, and Alina strode in with a look of cold determination. The air shifted as her sharp gaze fixed on Bianca, clearly unimpressed with their plotting.\n\"You should stay away from Finn, Bianca,\" Alina said, her tone icy. \"Or else you might just vanish. And trust me, no one will care enough to look for you.\"\nBianca's eyes narrowed, the initial shock quickly turning to irritation. \"This doesn't concern you, Alina,\" she sneered, trying to mask her discomfort. \"Why don't you just stay out of it? You have no idea what's really going on here.\"\nAlina took a step closer, crossing her arms as a smirk spread across her face. \"Oh, I know exactly what's going on,\" she said, her voice low but firm. \"You're scheming against Finn, using Jenny here to carry out your pathetic little plot. You think you can manipulate him, make him doubt Lia, and get rid of her in one sweep. It's transparent and weak, Bianca.\"\nJenny bristled, feeling the sting of Alina's words but unwilling to back down. She exchanged a quick glance with Bianca, unsure of how they would handle Alina's unexpected intrusion. Bianca, however, met Alina's stare with defiance.\n\"Get out,\" Bianca hissed, her voice trembling slightly. \"This isn't your concern. Go run along and play the loyal little sister elsewhere.\"\nAlina laughed softly, shaking her head as if Bianca's words were nothing more than a minor irritation. \"You think you're untouchable, Bianca, but you're just another pawn in this game, whether you realize it or not. And don't think I haven't heard about your so-called plan. It's laughable that you think it will actually work.\"\nThe smugness drained from Bianca's face, replaced by a flicker of uncertainty. Alina's confidence, the way she seemed to know every detail of their scheme, unnerved her. Before Bianca could respond, Alina turned on her heel and strode toward the door.\nPausing in the doorway, Alina cast one last glance over her shoulder. \"Good luck with your little scheme,\" she said with a mocking smile. \"Let's see if it really comes to pass, or if you two just end up embarrassing yourselves.\"\nWith that, she walked out, leaving Jenny and Bianca in stunned silence. For a moment, neither of them moved, the tension in the room thickening as they processed Alina's words. Jenny felt a chill run down her spine, the doubt creeping in despite her best efforts to brush it off.\n\"Do you think she'll try to stop us?\" Jenny asked quietly, unable to mask the worry in her voice.\nBianca clenched her fists, jaw tightening. \"Let her try. She's bluffing, Jenny. Alina doesn't have the power to stop us, not if we stick to the plan. We just need to be careful, keep everything under wraps, and make sure we control what Finn sees. Alina's just trying to scare us off.\"\nJenny nodded, though Alina's warning lingered in her mind, gnawing at her confidence. She wanted to believe Bianca, to trust that Alina's words were nothing more than an empty threat. But as they returned to their planning, a small part of her couldn't shake the feeling that Alina might be more dangerous than they had realized.\n123\nBianca's POV \nBianca's mind was racing, and she could still feel the lingering impact of Alina's words, each one like a barb poking at her confidence. For the first time, doubt slipped through the cracks in her carefully constructed plan. She glanced at Jenny, who looked just as shaken, her eyes darting toward the door as if expecting Alina to burst back in at any moment.\n\"Do you think she's onto us?\" Jenny whispered, breaking the tense silence. Her voice was laced with fear and confusion. \"Did she follow us, Bianca? How did she find out?\"\nBianca swallowed, her thoughts scrambled. Alina had been so sure of herself, so calm. And the way she'd warned Bianca It wasn't an empty threat. She could tell Alina knew something, but how much?\n\"I don't know,\" Bianca muttered, her voice shaking slightly. She tried to mask it, but Jenny wasn't fooled. \"But if Alina's onto us, it means she could have been watching our every move. We might be underestimating her.\"\nJenny's eyes widened. \"Then what about Lex? He's supposed to handle Lia at the wedding tomorrow. If Alina is watching, it's only a matter of time before she warns Finn.\"\nPanic surged in Bianca. They'd spent so long planning every detail, and now everything seemed to be unraveling. Alina's sudden appearance left her feeling exposed. They couldn't afford to be reckless now, not with the wedding so close.\nBianca's gaze shot to her phone. \"We need to reach Lex. If there's even a chance Alina's onto us, we have to tell him to stop. Just until we can get everything back under control.\"\nShe dialed Lex's number, her fingers trembling slightly as she pressed the phone to her ear. It rang once, twice-then clicked over to voicemail. Frustration bubbled inside her as she tried again, with the same result. \"His line isn't going through,\" she muttered angrily, trying to keep her voice steady. \"This isn't good.\"\nJenny's hands fidgeted nervously, her face mirroring Bianca's worry. \"What if he still goes through with it tomorrow? We can't have him do anything rash if Alina is watching. This is too risky, Bianca.\"\nBianca clenched her jaw, forcing herself to think clearly. \"We need to make sure Lex doesn't act without knowing the full situation. If Alina's really spying on us, we'll be in deep trouble if Lex does anything tomorrow. But how are we supposed to contact him if he's ignoring our calls?\"\nJenny's face paled. \"You said you know him well, right? You can find him, or at least know someone who can reach him?\"\nBianca hesitated, a flash of uncertainty crossing her face. \"I don't know him as well as I made it seem. He's just someone I met randomly who seemed interested in working with us. But I don't know his circle or his habits well enough to track him down.\"\nJenny's face fell, her anxiety growing with each word. \"Bianca, this is serious. We need someone who can get through to him and tell him to hold off. If Lex goes forward with the plan during the wedding, it's all over for us. Alina's probably already keeping an eye on everything we do.\"\nBianca clenched her fists, pushing down the rising panic. She had to stay calm, stay focused. \"We don't have time to second-guess, Jenny. We're getting an investigator. Someone discreet, who can track Lex down and stop him before he goes through with anything. I don't care what it costs-we can't let him jeopardize our plan.\"\nJenny nodded, pulling her phone out and scrolling through her contacts. \"I know someone reliable, someone who can keep things quiet and work fast. We'll have them look into Lex's whereabouts and get him a message if they can't find him directly.\"\nAs Jenny made the call, Bianca sat back, her thoughts swirling. The pieces of their plan felt like they were slipping out of her hands, and all because of Alina. She could barely contain the anger rising within her. Alina had no right to meddle in something that didn't concern her.\nJenny ended the call, looking back at Bianca. \"They'll start immediately. They promised to keep it discreet, and they'll let us know if they find anything.\"\nBianca forced herself to nod, though the knot in her stomach only tightened. \"Good. We need to be ready for anything tomorrow. If Alina is really onto us, she won't make it easy. We just have to stay one step ahead.\"\nBut despite her own words, Bianca couldn't shake the dread that had settled deep in her chest. For the first time, she felt the gravity of the game they were playing. If Alina managed to expose them or warned Finn in time, everything would crumble. She couldn't afford to fail-not now.\n\"We'll get through this,\" Jenny murmured, though her voice held a trace of doubt. \"As long as Lex doesn't mess things up tomorrow, we'll still have control.\"\nBianca tried to convince herself of the same, though the shadow of Alina's warning lingered in her mind. The feeling of being watched, of knowing someone was already a step ahead, was unnerving. But she couldn't let that stop her-not when she was so close to finally seeing Lia gone.\n124\nLia's POV \nAs I stepped through the front doors, the grandeur of Finn's estate felt even more imposing tonight. Everything seemed amplified, and for once, the place that I'd become so familiar with felt foreign like I was walking into a well-laid trap. But I pushed the thoughts aside as I reminded myself that tonight wasn't just any night-it was the dinner party, an engagement party of sorts.\nAfter slipping off my shoes, I headed to my room and began preparing for the evening. I picked out a satin dress in deep emerald green that hugged my curves and had an elegant sweep along the floor. The color was bold but refined, exactly the sort of look that Finn liked to see on me. As I was adjusting the neckline, I heard a gentle knock on the door.\n\"Come in,\" I called, thinking it was one of the house staff.\nFinn stepped inside, looking impossibly polished in a tailored black suit that made his figure even more imposing. In his hands, he held a small, velvet box. He gave me a half-smile, his usual intensity softened just a bit.\n\"I brought you something for tonight,\" he said, his voice low as he stepped closer. He opened the box, revealing a breathtaking diamond necklace that caught the light from every angle. The stones sparkled brilliantly, each cut into flawless gems, and I couldn't help but gasp a little.\n\"It's beautiful,\" I managed, my fingers brushing over the diamonds as he lifted them from the box.\nWithout a word, he reached behind me and fastened the necklace around my neck. His fingers were steady, but his gaze was intense, as though he were trying to read my thoughts. Once he was done, I caught his eyes in the mirror, and for a moment, we both just stood there, silent.\n\"There,\" he said, voice gruff. \"Now you're ready.\"\nWith one last lingering glance, he left, and I took a deep breath, trying to settle my nerves. Everything about tonight felt off, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was walking a fine line between worlds, my loyalties split, with secrets on all sides.\nWhen I descended the stairs, the hall was already filled with people. The decorations were elegant, with muted lighting casting a warm glow over the room. I spotted Benedicta near the entrance, waving at me, and I felt an immediate wave of relief. Her presence grounded me; she was a reminder of what I was fighting for, and her support meant everything.\nAs the evening unfolded, I noticed how everyone seemed engrossed in their own world, whispering behind glasses of champagne, clinking glasses, and sharing warm smiles. Yet, there was a tension in the air, one that I couldn't quite place. Every so often, I caught sight of Alina moving in and out of the hall. She looked more intense than usual, her gaze darting to various corners of the room.\nMore unsettling, however, was the way Bianca and Jenny seemed on edge. Their laughter was forced, their smiles brittle, and every few minutes, they'd exchange hurried glances that held a mixture of anxiety and dread. They were nervous, and that worried me.\nFinally, I slipped away, pretending I needed a moment outside for air. I ducked into a quiet hallway, far from the bustling hall, and quickly dialed Luca's number. He picked up almost instantly as if he'd been waiting for my call.\n\"Lia?\" he asked, his tone immediately serious.\n\"Yes. I wanted to tell you something strange is going on. Alina's acting suspiciously, coming in and out of the hall. And Bianca and Jenny-they look nervous. I think they're up to something. I just wanted to make sure we're not walking into any surprises,\" I whispered, casting a glance around me to ensure no one could overhear.\nThere was a pause, and then Luca's voice softened, soothing yet firm. \"Don't worry, Lia. Everything is under control. I've made arrangements for anything they might try. Stick to the plan, and don't let them see you're nervous.\"\nHis words calmed me, and I let out a shaky breath. \"Are you sure?\" I asked.\n\"Absolutely. I have eyes on them, and I'll know if anything changes. Just go back in there and act like tonight is exactly what it should be. The less they suspect, the better.\"\nAfter a beat, I nodded to myself, despite him not being able to see it. \"All right, I trust you, Luca. But stay close, okay?\"\n\"I will,\" he promised, and with that, we hung up.\nI straightened, smoothing out the folds of my dress and steadying my breathing. Luca's reassurance lingered in my mind as I made my way back to the hall. I slipped inside, doing my best to look at ease, and found Benedicta waiting for me. She gave me a small smile, oblivious to the undercurrents pulsing through the room. For her, tonight was nothing more than an engagement party, a new beginning. I held onto that image, hoping it would carry me through.\nAs the night went on, I tried to stay engaged in conversations, nodding and smiling in all the right places. Alina's frequent disappearances and Bianca's stolen glances toward me still prickled my nerves, but I kept Luca's words in mind. I stayed composed, unbothered, exactly what they didn't expect. This was just the beginning, I reminded myself.\nAnd as I sipped my champagne, casting a casual look across the room, I knew I was playing a delicate game. A game that only I-and perhaps Luca-could understand.\n___\nLuca's POV \nI walked briskly to my car, tension knotting in my stomach. Lex was supposed to check in with me this morning, but all I got was radio silence. Something was off, and I needed answers.\nSliding into the driver's seat, I dialed his number as I started the car. It rang and rang, but no answer. My fingers tapped against the steering wheel impatiently as I drove toward the last place we'd met. I dialed again, feeling a sense of dread creeping in. If Lex had been involved with Bianca and Jenny's plans, anything could have happened.\nFinally, the call connected. I opened my mouth to speak, but before I could say anything, the unmistakable sound of gunfire exploded from the other end. My heart dropped. There was no mistaking it-Lex was in trouble, or worse.\nThe line went dead. My hands tightened around the steering wheel as I tried to process what had just happened. Who would take out Lex? And why now, right when we needed him to keep Bianca and Jenny's plans from spiraling out of control?\nI gritted my teeth, forcing myself to stay calm as I sped toward the meeting place. Lex might not have been a saint, but he was a necessary piece in our plan, and whoever took him out clearly knew what they were doing. This changed everything.\nAs I pulled into the empty lot where we'd last met, a strange silence hung over the place. I scanned the area, half expecting to see a shadow move or a flash of a weapon. But there was nothing-only the eerie quiet as if the whole place was holding its breath.\nI got out of the car, my senses on high alert. My mind was racing with questions. Had Lex betrayed me, or had someone else gotten to him before he could relay any vital information? Either way, I knew one thing for certain-someone was making moves, and they were closer than I'd realized.\nThe plans we'd carefully set in motion now seemed like they were hanging by a thread. With Lex gone, I'd lost an essential link to Bianca's inner circle, and now, there was no one to monitor her plans directly. I couldn't be everywhere at once, but I'd have to act fast to keep everything from collapsing.\nI got back into my car, dialing Lia's number. If anything, she had to know what was going on. I couldn't let her walk into a trap, not when it was clear we were up against someone ruthless.\nAs the phone rang, I kept my gaze on the road ahead, eyes scanning every movement, every shadow. Tonight was the engagement party, but now, it felt like a countdown to something far darker.\nLia picked up. \"Luca?\" Her voice was soft, uncertain.\n\"Listen carefully,\" I said, voice low. \"Lex is gone. Something happened, and I don't know who's responsible yet. Just keep your guard up tonight. Don't let anyone catch you off balance.\"\nA long pause, and then, \"Understood.\"\n125\nLia's POV \nAs I made my way through the elegant crowd, I couldn't shake the feeling of anxiety clawing at my chest. The engagement party was in full swing, with laughter and music filling the air, but my mind was miles away, focused on the ominous phone call I'd had with Luca. The uncertainty surrounding Lex's fate left a knot of dread in my stomach. It was all I could do to keep a calm face in front of the guests.\nBenedicta, ever so perceptive, leaned over and placed a comforting hand on my arm. \"Lia, you seem on edge tonight. Is something bothering you?\" she asked, her voice soft but firm.\nI took a shaky breath, realizing I couldn't keep this from her. She was like a mother to me, and if anyone could help me, it was her. \"Benedicta, Luca called me earlier,\" I whispered, glancing around to make sure no one was listening. \"He said Lex is missing. He heard gunshots on the line, and he thinks something terrible has happened.\"\nHer eyes widened slightly, but she kept her composure. \"Oh, Lia,\" she murmured, her hand squeezing mine. \"You're worried that this is more than a simple disappearance.\"\nI nodded, feeling the weight of it all crashing down on me. \"Yes and there's more. Ever since I arrived tonight, I've noticed Jenny and Bianca acting strange. They're restless, whispering to each other, constantly looking over their shoulders. I have this gut feeling that they know something about what happened to Lex.\"\nBenedicta's gaze was calm and calculating. She gave me a reassuring smile but shook her head. \"Lia, listen to me carefully. Don't jump to conclusions. I know you're worried, and I don't doubt your instincts, but sometimes our fears can lead us down the wrong path. Leave this to Luca. He's already working to get to the bottom of it. The best thing you can do now is focus on tonight and act as though nothing is wrong.\"\nI let her words sink in, knowing she was right. Benedicta always had a way of grounding me, of keeping me from letting my emotions get the better of me. I forced myself to take a deep breath, letting the tension in my shoulders release just a little.\nJust then, Finn approached us, a warm smile on his face. \"Benedicta,\" he greeted her, taking her hand respectfully. \"It's a pleasure to have you here tonight. You did a remarkable job raising Lia. She's strong, intelligent, and everything I could hope for in a partner.\"\nBenedicta returned his smile, clearly pleased by his praise. \"Thank you, Finn. Lia is like a daughter to me, and I'm thrilled she's found someone who appreciates her qualities. I can see you're both a good match.\"\nA hint of pride touched my heart at her words, but the underlying tension remained. Finn and Benedicta exchanged a few more pleasantries before he excused himself to mingle with the other guests, leaving us alone again.\nAs soon as he was out of earshot, I turned back to Benedicta, the knot in my stomach tightening. \"I don't know how to explain it, but something feels off about Jenny and Bianca. They're hiding something, and I feel like it's connected to what happened to Lex. Every time I look at them, they seem nervous, like they're waiting for something to happen.\"\nBenedicta regarded me thoughtfully, her expression unreadable. \"Lia, you may be right, but jumping to confront them could put you at risk. Bianca, especially, is not someone to underestimate. Let Luca handle it. He knows what he's doing, and he won't let anything happen to you.\"\nI hesitated, chewing my lip as I considered her advice. \"I understand, but waiting around, pretending everything is normal it's not easy.\"\nShe placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. \"I know, but trust me. Luca has his ways, and he'll keep you safe. You have to play the part tonight, Lia. Don't let anyone suspect that you're worried. Blend in, smile, and let Luca do the heavy lifting.\"\nTaking a deep breath, I nodded, feeling a renewed sense of resolve. Benedicta was right. Luca was handling it, and I had to trust that he knew what he was doing. For now, I needed to focus on the engagement and let my suspicions lie.\nAs the evening wore on, I kept an eye on Bianca and Jenny from a distance. Their behavior hadn't changed-Jenny kept whispering to Bianca, and Bianca's gaze darted around the room as if she were expecting someone to approach her at any moment. They were definitely hiding something, but what?\nSuddenly, I felt a warm hand on my shoulder. I turned to see Benedicta smiling at me, her eyes kind but filled with a silent reminder to keep calm. \"Lia, remember what we talked about. Breathe, and focus on the night.\"\nI forced myself to smile back at her, nodding as I tried to push my worries aside. She was right. Tonight was too important to let my anxiety show. With a deep breath, I pulled my shoulders back, determined to face the night with confidence.\nLater, as I moved through the crowd, I slipped out onto the balcony for a moment to gather my thoughts. I reached for my phone, dialing Luca's number. When he picked up, his voice was low and calm. \"Lia?\"\n\"They're here, Luca. Jenny and Bianca are acting strange. I feel like they're on edge almost as if they know about Lex,\" I whispered.\nLuca's response was measured. \"Everything is under control, Lia. Don't let them suspect you know anything. Stay calm, and go back inside. I'll take care of it.\"\nHis reassurance brought me a sense of calm, and I thanked him before hanging up. Tucking my phone away, I took one last deep breath, steeling myself to return to the party.\nAs I re-entered the hall, I noticed Benedicta's approving smile. She had been right about everything. For now, I would follow her advice and stay focused on the night. I'd let Luca do his work, and I'd do mine: act like the perfect fiancée and leave my suspicions hidden-at least, for now.\n126\nJenny's POV \nThe engagement party felt like it was closing in on us. Bianca and I could barely sit still after Alina's cryptic warning earlier. She knew about our plan, and the look in her eyes said she was far from done with us. The idea of staying here, surrounded by people who might catch on to our plans, was unbearable. We exchanged nervous glances, silently agreeing to slip out. We needed to see Lex, regroup, and figure out what to do now that Alina was in the loop.\nAs we sneaked toward the exit, glancing over our shoulders every few steps, the cool night air hit us like a wake-up call, and I felt a small rush of relief. But just as we reached the car, I heard a voice behind us. \"And where do you think you're going?\"\nWe both spun around to see Alina standing a few feet away, her arms crossed, a smirk pulling at the corners of her lips. The way she looked at us was unnerving, her eyes practically daring us to answer.\n\"The party's not over,\" she said casually. \"Shouldn't you be inside?\"\nBianca shot her a venomous look. \"Mind your business, Alina. I'm warning you-don't push us.\"\nAlina chuckled, the sound low and mocking. \"You're warning me? I'm curious, Bianca exactly how do you plan to make good on that threat?\"\nI felt Bianca tense beside me, but before she could say something she'd regret, I grabbed her arm and pulled her toward the car. \"Let's go, Bianca. She's not worth it.\"\nAlina's laughter followed us as we got into the car, but I forced myself to ignore it, shutting the door firmly behind us. As soon as we were inside, I shot Bianca a look that hopefully conveyed the urgency of the situation. She exhaled sharply, shaking her head as we pulled out of the driveway.\nThe drive to Lex's place was silent, the tension between us thick. Every now and then, I'd catch Bianca fidgeting or muttering to herself. I couldn't shake the unease Alina's words had stirred in me, and the fact that she seemed to know so much unnerved me. But right now, we needed to focus on Lex.\nWhen we pulled up to Lex's house, something felt off. The front door was slightly ajar, swaying gently as if someone had entered before us. I exchanged a worried glance with Bianca. This wasn't like Lex at all-he was always careful about security, especially with the stakes so high.\n\"Did he leave the door open?\" Bianca whispered, her voice barely audible.\nI shook my head. \"Let's just get inside and find out what's going on.\"\nAs we stepped inside, an unpleasant smell hit us immediately. The place was eerily silent, with an odd stillness in the air. Every instinct in me screamed that something was wrong, but we pressed forward, moving down the hallway that led to the bathroom.\nWhen we reached the door, Bianca pushed it open slowly. What we saw inside made my stomach drop.\nThere, in the bathtub, was Lex. His body was sprawled out in the water, motionless, his skin pale and sickly. The once-clear water had turned murky, and an overpowering stench filled the room. It was obvious he'd been dead for a while.\nBianca clamped a hand over her mouth, her eyes wide with horror. I could feel my own heart hammering against my chest, my mind barely processing what I was seeing. Lex gone? How?\n\"We need to get out of here,\" I whispered, tugging on Bianca's arm.\nJust as we turned to leave, a sudden flash lit up the hallway, casting brief shadows across our bodies. We froze, dread pooling in the pit of my stomach.\n\"Did you see that?\" Bianca whispered, her voice trembling.\nI nodded, scanning the area around us. It felt like someone was watching us, but the hallway was empty. There were no footsteps, no sign of anyone nearby. Yet the flash had been real, unmistakable, like a camera snapping photos.\n\"Come on, let's go,\" I hissed, pulling Bianca with me as we stumbled back through the hall and out the front door. My nerves were frayed, every sound amplified as if someone was following us. We practically ran to the car, our breaths coming in short, panicked bursts.\nOnce inside, Bianca locked the doors, her face pale and terrified. She glanced around, her eyes darting from one side of the street to the other as if expecting someone to step out from the shadows. \"Jenny do you think someone's following us? Taking pictures?\"\n\"I don't know,\" I replied, my voice barely above a whisper. \"But we need to get out of here. Now.\"\nBianca didn't need any more convincing. She started the car, and we peeled away from Lex's house, the tires screeching as we sped down the road. My heart was still pounding, my mind racing with questions. Who could have been taking those pictures? Was it Alina? Had she somehow followed us?\nBianca gripped the wheel tightly, her knuckles white. \"Jenny what are we going to do?\"\n\"I don't know,\" I replied honestly, staring out the window, half-expecting to see a car following us. \"But this changes everything. We need to figure out who's behind this.\"\nBianca took a shaky breath, glancing at me. \"Do you think it was Alina? Could she have set this up?\"\n\"It's possible,\" I admitted, though I couldn't be sure. Alina knew something, and she'd already made it clear that she was onto us. But could she really have gone this far?\nThe idea of Alina orchestrating this felt far-fetched, yet nothing seemed impossible at this point. We were dealing with someone who had no problem crossing boundaries.\nAs we drove back toward the main part of town, Bianca's phone rang. She picked it up, her hands shaking slightly. But when she saw the caller ID, her face went pale, and she quickly declined the call.\n\"Who was it?\" I asked, my pulse quickening.\n\"An unknown number,\" she whispered, her voice thick with fear. \"Jenny what if it's them?\"\nWe both fell silent, the weight of Lex's death and the unsettling flash at his house pressing heavily on us. Whatever was happening, we were in far deeper than we'd ever intended. And now, more than ever, it felt like someone was pulling the strings in ways we couldn't see or control.\n129\nLuca's POV \nThe city lights blurred past as I gripped the steering wheel, my thoughts racing as I headed toward Lex's place. Lex was dead. Not just dead-taken out. The guy had his share of enemies, but this? This was no random hit. Someone was making a point, and I'd heard it loud and clear. They wanted Lex silenced, and now they'd have everyone he worked with looking over their shoulders.\nI killed the headlights as I turned onto his street, parking a few blocks away. If whoever did this was still lurking, I didn't want to be the next easy target. The night air was heavy, and every shadow seemed to watch as I made my way toward his apartment building, my senses on high alert. The whole place was quiet, almost too quiet.\nI reached his door and noticed it was slightly ajar, the lock busted. Whoever had done this wasn't interested in covering their tracks. I pushed the door open, my pulse hammering as I stepped inside, gun drawn. The place reeked of metal and stale air, an all-too-familiar scent. I knew what I'd find even before I saw him, lying there in the tub, eyes wide open and lifeless.\nI swallowed hard, keeping my emotions locked tight. Lex may not have been the most reliable, but he didn't deserve this. It was brutal-a calculated move meant to send fear rippling through everyone who crossed paths with him. I'd seen scenes like this before, but this time, it felt personal. And whoever did this wanted it to feel that way.\n\"Damn it, Lex,\" I muttered under my breath. He'd warned me-said something about Jenny and Bianca having their hands in something big. I'd brushed him off, chalking it up to paranoia. Now, I wasn't so sure.\nI moved through the apartment, keeping my eyes peeled for anything that might give me a lead. Lex wasn't the type to leave incriminating evidence lying around, but maybe, just maybe, he'd stashed something useful. I rummaged through drawers, checked under tables, and even peered behind his old bookshelf. Nothing. Whoever had done this had been thorough.\nJust as I was about to give up, I caught sight of a small, red light blinking in the corner near the ceiling. A surveillance camera. Lex always was paranoid. I felt a flicker of hope-if that camera was working, it might've caught something. I grabbed a chair and reached up, pulling down the camera and carefully removing the memory card. Maybe this little piece of tech would give me the answers Lex never could.\nSuddenly, a faint flash lit up the corner of the room. My heart leaped-I wasn't alone. I whipped around, gun raised, but saw nothing. The flash was gone, and the room was still. But my instincts screamed at me. Someone was watching.\nI moved fast, pocketing the memory card and making a beeline for the door. Whoever had taken that picture was gone, but I didn't have time to wait around to find out if they'd be back. As I slipped out the door, I kept my eyes scanning every corner, every shadow.\nBy the time I got back to my car, I'd worked out three possibilities. Either someone was watching Lex's apartment waiting for a chance to strike again, or someone had followed me here, thinking I was part of Lex's scheme. Or-and this was the one that unsettled me the most-someone already knew I'd come looking and wanted me to feel the same fear Lex must have felt in his last moments.\nSliding into the driver's seat, I locked the doors, took a deep breath, and popped the memory card into my phone. A shoddy recording, filled with static and brief glimpses of Lex's last moments. But it was enough. I could make out two shadowy figures-a man and a woman, both familiar. Bianca and Jenny. They'd been here, likely moments before his death.\nThe pieces fell into place, and a surge of anger twisted in my gut. So, they were involved after all. They'd tried to act innocent, playing it cool at the party, but they were hiding something much darker than I'd thought.\nBut why kill Lex now? And who else might be pulling the strings?\nThe last frame of the video showed Lex, frozen in fear, his eyes darting toward the door before the screen cut to black. He'd seen his killers coming, knew they were coming for him, and they'd made sure to keep him quiet. The thought sickened me, but it also lit a fire in me. If Bianca and Jenny thought they could play this game without me knowing, they were dead wrong.\nI started the engine, already forming my next move. If they wanted to play dirty, I'd go even deeper. Whatever they were up to, I'd find out. And if they were connected to this tangled web of lies and murder, they'd have a lot more to worry about than just me.\n____\nLia's POV \nAs I walked Benedicta to her car, the cool night air settled around us, soothing yet strangely heavy. I gave her a small smile, reaching for her hands. \"Send my love to Merlin, will you?\" I said softly, picturing my son's face.\nBenedicta nodded, her eyes warm. \"Of course, Lia. He misses you, you know. He can't wait to see you again.\"\nI sighed, feeling the tug in my chest. \"I miss him too. Soon, I'll have him back in my arms, just like old times.\" I tried to keep my voice steady, but the thought of Merlin, far away from me, brought a pang of longing.\nBenedicta reached out, squeezing my shoulder. \"Stay focused. Tomorrow is important. Get through it, and everything else will fall into place.\"\nAs she drove off, I took a deep breath and turned back toward the house. I walked through the doors, greeted by the quiet murmurs of the remaining guests and the occasional clink of glasses. I found Finn near the entrance, looking perfectly composed, his gaze following me as I walked toward him. He smiled, an unreadable look in his eyes.\n\"Did Benedicta get off safely?\" he asked, slipping an arm around my waist as he leaned in.\n\"Yes, she's on her way home,\" I replied, offering a smile that didn't quite reach my eyes.\nHe walked with me to the staircase, stopping briefly. \"Tomorrow is a big day,\" he murmured, his eyes searching mine. \"Are you excited?\"\nI forced myself to nod, knowing that anything less would spark his curiosity. \"Of course, Finn. I can't wait,\" I said, though my words felt hollow. \"It's just been such a long day, and I could really use some rest.\" I offered a slight smile, hoping he wouldn't press further.\n\"Good idea. Get some sleep,\" he said, giving me a soft peck on my forehead before turning to leave.\nAs soon as his footsteps faded down the hall, I shut the door behind me and turned the lock, sealing myself into the quiet sanctuary of my room. I took a few breaths, steadying myself. The weight of the day seemed to press down harder, the silence amplifying my racing thoughts. Lex's murder. Finn's unreadable expression. And the party tomorrow, where everyone would have eyes on us, waiting to see what unfolds.\nWithout hesitating, I reached for my phone, dialing Luca's number. It rang a few times before he picked up, his voice a low murmur. \"Lia?\"\n\"Luca,\" I whispered, glancing around as if someone might be listening. \"What's the latest? Did you find anything else about Lex's death? I can't shake this feeling that there's more going on than we know.\"\nHe sighed heavily. \"You're not wrong. This goes deeper than we thought. I managed to check out Lex's place and trust me, it wasn't a pretty sight. Whoever did it was efficient, almost as if they'd planned it down to the last second.\"\nThe image of Lex, cold and lifeless, sent a shiver through me. \"Do you think Bianca and Jenny could've been involved?\" I asked, my voice trembling.\n\"It's looking that way, but it's not that simple. I think someone else is pulling strings from the shadows. I spotted a camera in Lex's apartment, but as soon as I took it, I felt like I was being watched. Like someone was documenting my every move.\" His tone was dark, tinged with frustration. \"I got out of there fast, but I'm almost certain whoever's behind this is a step ahead of us.\"\nI bit my lip, trying to steady my nerves. The thought of being tangled in something this dangerous made my skin crawl, but I needed answers. \"So what do we do next?\"\n\"For now, play along. Act as if nothing is out of the ordinary. Whoever is behind this, they're expecting us to make a wrong move, and we can't give them that satisfaction. Tomorrow, during the party, keep an eye on Bianca and Jenny. Don't confront them, just observe. And stay close to people you trust.\"\n\"Alright,\" I murmured, though unease pooled in my stomach. \"But Luca this doesn't feel like something I can just pretend isn't happening.\"\nHe paused, then spoke softly. \"I know, Lia. But trust me-we're going to figure this out. Just stay sharp, and I'll be watching too. We'll get through tomorrow, and then we can strategize our next steps.\"\nThe call ended, and I found myself staring at the screen, my thoughts churning with everything he'd said. Part of me wanted to call Benedicta back, to tell her everything, but I knew I couldn't drag her deeper into this mess. She already had enough on her shoulders.\nI exhaled, feeling the weight of tomorrow settle heavily upon me. If everything went according to plan, I'd get through the engagement party, all smiles and nods, watching Bianca and Jenny for any slip-ups. But I couldn't shake the gnawing feeling that something was about to go horribly wrong.\nCurling up in bed, I lay there in the dark, eyes wide open, as the pieces of this twisted puzzle filled my mind. The people I trusted, the enemies I couldn't yet see, and the future that felt more uncertain than ever.\nTomorrow would come soon enough, and with it, every answer I was both desperate and afraid to uncover.\n129\nAlina's POV \nAs I shut the door to my room, I pulled out my phone, dialed a number, and waited. The line rang twice before a deep voice answered on the other end.\n\"Yes?\" he asked, his tone steady.\n\"Keep an eye on Bianca and Jenny,\" I instructed, keeping my voice low. \"I want to know everything they're planning, every move they make. Don't miss a single detail.\"\nThere was a brief pause on the other end. \"Understood. I'll make sure they're covered. Do you expect them to act soon?\"\nI took a breath, choosing my words carefully. \"Yes. They're on edge, and when people are desperate, they make mistakes. I want to be one step ahead of them.\"\n\"Got it,\" he replied, the confidence in his tone reassuring.\nI ended the call and slipped my phone back into my pocket, feeling a sense of satisfaction. Everything was in place. I knew Bianca and Jenny were hiding something dangerous, and now I would finally get to the bottom of it. If they thought they could outsmart me, they were in for a rude awakening.\nI opened my door, ready to head back to the party, but as I stepped out, I nearly collided with someone. Standing there, as if she had been waiting for me, was Benedicta. Her presence was unexpected, and I felt my guard immediately rise.\n\"Benedicta,\" I said, forcing a polite smile. \"What are you doing in the main house? Aren't you a guest? You should know your place.\"\nShe looked startled but quickly regained her composure, offering me a disarming smile. \"Oh, I I was looking for the bathroom. I must have taken a wrong turn.\"\nI studied her carefully, noting the way her eyes darted away from mine. \"The bathroom is in the other direction.\" I pointed down the hall, narrowing my eyes slightly. \"Next time, be more careful. It's easy to get lost.\"\nBenedicta gave a small nod and headed toward the bathroom. As she disappeared down the hall, I couldn't shake the feeling that her story was just a little too convenient. The way she avoided eye contact, the excuse of getting lost-it didn't sit right with me.\nI watched her retreating figure, my suspicions growing. In the back of my mind, a thought lingered, echoing with a fierce intensity: I'll find out what you're up to, Benedicta. Whatever secrets you're hiding, they won't stay hidden for long.\nWith one last look down the hallway, I shook off the unease and made my way back to the party. The music, the laughter, and the clinking glasses filled the air as I rejoined the crowd, slipping back into the flow of the celebration as if nothing had happened. But my mind was already calculating, plotting the next steps, certain that both Benedicta and Bianca's games were about to end.\nLuca's POV \nAs soon as I received the address for Lex's place, I hit the gas and drove through the quiet streets, my mind racing. Something was off, and I could feel it in the pit of my stomach. The silence on his end, the missed calls-it didn't add up. Lex was a lot of things, but careless wasn't one of them.\nWhen I finally reached the house, a chill ran down my spine. The front door was left slightly open, swaying in the night breeze. I stepped out of the car, moving cautiously as I approached the entrance, my senses heightened. There was an eerie stillness that wrapped around the place, a silence that felt unnatural.\nInside, the house was dark except for a dim light coming from the hallway. The scent of something stale hung in the air, making my stomach turn. I didn't need to go far to sense that something terrible had happened. As I ventured further into the house, I finally saw the bathroom door left ajar, hinting at the gruesome scene within.\nThe sight was chilling, but I forced myself to stay composed. Lex's lifeless body was sprawled in the bathtub, the water dark and murky. It was a brutal reminder of the lengths some people would go to in order to silence those who stood in their way.\nI took a deep breath, steadying myself as I scanned the room. There were no obvious signs of a struggle, but the silence spoke volumes. Whoever did this wanted to send a message.\nI turned away from the bathroom, my mind working quickly. If anyone had left traces, I needed to find them before someone else did. Moving to the main hallway, I spotted a small security camera mounted on the wall. A sense of relief washed over me; maybe there was still a chance of recovering evidence.\nBut as I moved closer to inspect it, my heart sank. I couldn't risk leaving a trail for anyone else to follow. Gritting my teeth, I reached up and disabled the camera, effectively erasing any footage that might compromise me-or anyone else who mattered.\nJust as I finished, a sudden flash caught my attention. For a split second, the light hit my face, almost like a camera flash. My instincts kicked in, and I spun around, scanning the darkness around me.\nNothing. No footsteps, no voices, just that single flash that left me feeling exposed. It could have been a passerby, or worse, someone waiting for me to make a move. Whoever had taken Lex out might still be nearby, watching, waiting.\nI forced myself to remain calm, carefully retracing my steps back to the front door. Every muscle in my body was tense as I slipped outside, moving toward my car, my eyes scanning the area for any sign of movement.\nOnce inside, I locked the doors and gripped the steering wheel, my pulse pounding in my ears. Whoever was responsible for this wasn't just a threat to Lex-they were coming after everyone involved, and they were ruthless enough to make it clear.\nAs I started the engine and pulled away from the house, my mind was already on high alert. I needed answers, and I needed them fast. This was no longer a simple game of strategy; it was a race for survival.\nAnd if someone thought they could take me down that easily, they were about to find out just how wrong they were.\n130\nBianca's POV\nMy hands trembled slightly as I dialed yet another number. The list of contacts I'd carefully curated over the years dwindled with every unanswered call, leaving me more frustrated with each passing minute. Yet, I couldn't give up now-not with everything on the line.\n\"Have you heard anything?\" I asked as soon as the line connected, my voice sharp, betraying the unease bubbling beneath my polished exterior.\n\"Nothing definitive,\" came the clipped response. \"But we're still looking.\"\nI ended the call with a terse thank-you and leaned back in my chair, pressing my fingers against my temples. The tension pounding behind my eyes was unbearable, but I didn't dare stop. Lex's death had thrown everything into chaos, and the longer I remained in the dark, the more vulnerable we became.\nWhen the chime of a new notification broke through the silence, I straightened immediately, my pulse quickening. My investigator had sent something-a video.\nWith a flick of my finger, I opened the file, my breath catching as the footage played. The quality was grainy, but it was unmistakable: Luca. The timestamp confirmed it. He had been in Lex's house after his death.\nA slow, triumphant smile crept across my face. \"So, you're not as clean as you pretend to be,\" I whispered, leaning back and replaying the video. My mind began to spin with possibilities. This could be the leverage I needed.\nBut the sound of approaching footsteps pulled me from my thoughts. I scrambled to close the video and lock my phone, shoving it under a stack of papers just as the door creaked open.\nJenny stepped in, her eyes darting around the room before settling on me. \"Any updates?\" she asked, her tone anxious but laced with impatience.\nI forced a neutral expression, shaking my head. \"Nothing yet. I've been making calls, but no one seems to know anything.\"\nJenny frowned, pacing across the room. \"We need answers, Bianca. This isn't just about Lex anymore. If anyone finds out how deeply we're involved, it's over for us.\"\n\"I know,\" I said, keeping my voice calm even as my fingers itched to grab my phone and rewatch the video. \"But panicking won't help. We have to tread carefully.\"\nJenny stopped and turned to face me, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. \"I hate this. Every time I look over my shoulder, I feel like someone's watching. First, Alina with her cryptic threats, and now this? I can't shake the feeling that we're being hunted.\"\nHer words sent a shiver down my spine, but I kept my composure. \"No one knows, Jenny. And as long as we stick to the plan, they won't. We just have to be smart.\"\nJenny sighed, running a hand through her hair. \"I don't know, Bianca. I'm starting to think we should just leave. Get out before it's too late.\"\n\"And do what? Run for the rest of our lives?\" I snapped, my frustration spilling over. \"That's not an option. We have to see this through.\"\nJenny stared at me for a moment before nodding reluctantly. \"Fine. But if anything goes wrong, I'm not sticking around to find out what happens next.\"\nAs she left the room, I let out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding. The tension between us was growing, but I couldn't let that distract me.\nI reached for my phone, unlocking it to stare at the paused frame of Luca leaving Lex's house. His expression was unreadable, but the sight of him there was damning enough. If he thought he could play the hero and pin everything on us, he was sorely mistaken.\nThis video was my insurance. My safety net. And when the time came, I wouldn't hesitate to use it.\nBut for now, I had to keep playing the game, even if it meant pretending to be as clueless as Jenny.\nNo one could know what I had, not yet.\n_____\nLuca's POV\nI drove through the quiet streets, my grip on the steering wheel tightening with every passing moment. The image of Lex's lifeless body in the tub haunted me, replaying in vivid detail. Whoever had killed him wanted chaos-no, they wanted to dismantle every thread connecting us to the truth.\nAs I pulled up to Benedicta's house, I took a deep breath, trying to gather my thoughts. I needed her advice, her perspective. This wasn't a battle I could fight alone.\nThe door swung open before I could even knock. Benedicta stood there, her eyes narrowing with concern as she looked me over.\n\"Come in,\" she said softly, stepping aside to let me in.\nI followed her into the cozy living room, the faint scent of lavender calming my nerves just a bit. She motioned for me to sit, but I remained standing, unable to keep still.\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked, crossing her arms and leaning against the armrest of the sofa. \"You look like you've seen a ghost.\"\nI exhaled sharply, running a hand through my hair. \"It's Lex. He's dead.\"\nHer eyes widened, but she stayed silent, urging me to continue.\n\"I went to his house after piecing together his location,\" I explained, pacing back and forth. \"When I got there, I found him in the tub-drowned. The stench was unbearable, Benedicta. He's been dead for days.\"\nBenedicta gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. \"Who who could have done this?\"\n\"That's the thing,\" I said, stopping to look at her. \"I don't think Bianca or Jenny had anything to do with it. Sure, they're reckless and desperate, but this?\" I shook my head. \"This feels calculated. Someone is trying to frame them or, worse, cover their own tracks.\"\nBenedicta sank into the sofa, her face pale. \"Does Lia know?\"\n\"Not all of it,\" I admitted. \"She knows something's wrong, but I haven't told her the full story. She doesn't need to carry that weight, especially not with everything else going on.\"\nBenedicta nodded slowly, her gaze distant. \"What about tomorrow? The wedding?\"\nI clenched my fists, the thought of Lia marrying Finn twisting my stomach into knots. \"It's the only way to keep her safe. Whoever is behind this they're dangerous. If they think Lia knows anything or is a threat to their plan, they won't hesitate to come after her. Marrying Finn might give her a layer of protection.\"\n\"But it'll crush you,\" Benedicta said, her voice barely above a whisper.\nI looked away, unable to meet her eyes. \"It's not about me. It's about Lia. As long as she's alive and unharmed, I'll deal with whatever I have to.\"\nBenedicta stood and walked over to me, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder. \"You're making a tough choice, Luca. But I know you're doing it for the right reasons.\"\nI nodded, swallowing the lump in my throat. \"Thank you.\"\nShe gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze before stepping back. \"Stay strong. Lia's going to need you, even if she doesn't realize it right now.\"\nI turned to leave, the weight of the conversation pressing heavily on my chest. As I stepped outside and got into my car, the dam I'd been holding back finally began to crack.\nMy hands gripped the steering wheel tightly as a wave of emotions crashed over me. I wanted to scream, to punch something, to cry-but I couldn't. Not now. Not when so much was at stake.\nI leaned my head against the steering wheel, my eyes stinging. \"Lia,\" I whispered, her name slipping from my lips like a prayer.\nI missed her. I missed her laughter, her stubbornness, the way she looked at me like I was the only one who mattered. But tomorrow, I'd have to let her go.\nThe thought tore me apart, but I couldn't let my feelings cloud my judgment. Lia's safety came first, no matter how much it hurt.\nI took a shaky breath, wiping my face with the back of my hand before starting the engine. The night stretched endlessly ahead of me, filled with uncertainty and danger.\nBut one thing was clear: I'd protect Lia, even if it cost me everything.\n131\nLia's POV\nThe dream was terrifying.\nI was standing in a vast, empty hall adorned with wedding decorations. The air smelled metallic, thick, and suffocating. My wedding dress, pristine and white moments ago, was soaked with blood. The vibrant red seemed to pulse, a grotesque reminder of something I couldn't yet piece together.\nMy gaze fell downward, and there he was-Finn, lying in a pool of his own blood. His lifeless eyes stared up at me, accusing and hollow.\nMy hands trembled as I looked down at them. I was holding a knife.\n\"No...no, no, no!\" I screamed, the sound echoing through the empty hall.\nI tried to drop the knife, but it wouldn't leave my hand. My breaths came in short gasps, panic swelling in my chest. The walls around me seemed to close in, the decorations morphing into dark, clawed shapes.\nThen, faint laughter echoed. Low, guttural, and filled with malice.\nI spun around, searching for the source, but the hall was empty. The laughter grew louder until it consumed everything, drowning out even my frantic thoughts.\nAnd then, I woke up.\nMy body jolted upright in bed, drenched in sweat. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst. My trembling hand instinctively went to my neck, clutching the necklace Finn had given me the previous night.\nWhat kind of dream was that?\nI tried to calm my racing heart, but just then, I heard something-soft footsteps, the creak of my bedroom door moving ever so slightly.\nMy eyes darted toward the door.\nSomeone had just left my room.\nI froze, panic gripping me as the remnants of the dream bled into reality. For a moment, I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. But then I forced myself to stand, my knees shaky beneath me.\nI walked toward the door cautiously and peeked into the hallway. It was empty.\n\"Hello?\" I whispered, my voice barely audible.\nNo answer.\nThe hallway stretched out in both directions, dimly lit by the faint glow of a wall sconce. There was no one there, no sign of movement. But I was certain someone had been inside.\nI stepped back into the room, closing the door firmly behind me. My pulse refused to settle as I leaned against it, trying to process what had just happened.\nHad it been real? Or was my mind still tangled in the nightmare?\nI didn't sleep for the rest of the night. Every creak, every gust of wind sent a jolt through me. My eyes stayed fixed on the door, waiting for some explanation, some sign of what-or who-I had heard.\nBy the time dawn broke, I felt drained, my nerves frayed from the sleepless night.\nA knock at the door startled me, and I jumped, my heart leaping into my throat.\n\"Lia? It's me, your makeup artist!\"\nI exhaled shakily. \"Come in.\"\nThe door opened, and she entered, her face lit with excitement, carrying a large suitcase filled with makeup and styling tools.\n\"Good morning, Lia!\" she said brightly. \"Today's the big day!\"\nBig day. Right.\nI forced a smile, pushing the disturbing events of the night to the back of my mind. \"Good morning.\"\nShe set up her workstation near the window, chattering away about how beautiful I'd look, how lucky Finn was, and how this would be a day to remember.\nIf only she knew how unforgettable it already was-for all the wrong reasons.\nAs she began her work, brushing and blending, my thoughts drifted. The dream, the intruder, the ominous feeling gnawing at me-I couldn't ignore it. Something wasn't right, and I couldn't shake the feeling that today wouldn't just be about my wedding.\nIt would be about survival.\n___\nFinn's POV\nI adjusted the cufflinks on my shirt, trying to shake off the nervous energy that had been building all morning. Today was supposed to be the happiest day of my life, yet something about it felt...off. Lia had been distant last night, though I chalked it up to pre-wedding jitters. Still, I couldn't help but wonder if there was something she wasn't telling me.\nA knock at the door pulled me from my thoughts.\n\"Come in,\" I called, turning toward the sound.\nThe door creaked open, and Alina stepped inside. Her face was a mixture of determination and irritation, the kind she reserved for moments when she wanted to be heard-whether or not you agreed with her.\n\"Finn,\" she said, closing the door behind her.\nI sighed. \"Alina, whatever it is, I don't have time right now. The wedding is in a few hours.\"\n\"That's exactly why I'm here,\" she replied, crossing her arms. \"You can't marry her.\"\nI froze, staring at her. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\"You know exactly what I'm talking about,\" she said, stepping closer. \"Lia is not the right person for you. She's hiding something-no, many things-and I can't just stand by and watch you ruin your life.\"\nMy jaw tightened. \"Alina, we've been over this. I love her. Whatever issues you have with Lia, keep them to yourself. Today is not the day for this conversation.\"\n\"Don't be naive, Finn,\" she snapped. \"Love isn't enough when there are secrets and lies involved. You're blinded by your feelings for her, but I see her for what she truly is-a liability.\"\nI took a deep breath, trying to keep my temper in check. \"A liability? She's the woman I'm about to marry, Alina. The woman I've chosen to spend the rest of my life with. You don't have to like her, but you will respect her.\"\n\"I'm trying to protect you,\" she insisted, her voice rising. \"Do you think she's being honest with you? Why is she so close to Luca? Why does she always look like she's hiding something?\"\nMy fists clenched at my sides. \"Stop it, Alina. You don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\"I know more than you think,\" she shot back. \"I've seen the way she looks at Luca. Something is going on there, Finn, and if you go through with this marriage, you're only setting yourself up for heartbreak.\"\n\"That's enough!\" I shouted, my voice echoing through the room.\nAlina flinched but didn't back down. \"Finn-\"\n\"No,\" I interrupted, pointing toward the door. \"You've said your piece. Now get out.\"\nHer expression hardened. \"You'll regret this,\" she said, her tone laced with anger and frustration. \"When everything falls apart, don't say I didn't warn you.\"\nI turned away from her, unwilling to let her see the conflict her words had stirred within me. \"Get out, Alina.\"\nFor a moment, she didn't move. I could feel her gaze boring into my back, waiting for me to turn around, to say something-anything-that would give her an opening to continue the argument. But I remained silent, staring at my reflection in the mirror.\nFinally, I heard the door open and close, and the room fell quiet once more.\nI exhaled, running a hand through my hair.\nAlina's words lingered, a nagging voice in the back of my mind. Was she right? Was Lia hiding something from me?\nNo. I couldn't think like that. Lia loved me, and I loved her. Whatever doubts Alina had were her own, not mine.\nShaking my head, I focused on the day ahead. This wedding wasn't just a ceremony-it was a declaration, a promise\nthat no matter what challenges came our way, we would face them together.\nAnd not even Alina's doubts could change that.\n132\nLia's POV\nI sat in front of the vanity, staring at my reflection. My makeup was flawless, my hair pinned up elegantly, and the dress shimmered in the sunlight streaming through the window. But no amount of glamour could hide the anxiety swirling in my chest.\nA soft knock at the door pulled me from my thoughts. Aaid entered, bowing slightly. \"Ma'am, Benedicta is here to see you.\"\nI nodded, trying to compose myself. \"Let her in.\"\nAs the door opened, Benedicta stepped in a radiant smile on her face. She crossed the room and pulled me into a warm hug. \"My dear Lia,\" she whispered, her voice filled with emotion. \"You look beautiful.\"\nI felt a lump form in my throat. \"Thank you, Benedicta. I'm glad you're here.\"\nShe pulled back, her hands resting on my shoulders. \"It's a big day for you, and I just want you to know how proud I am. I wish you all the happiness in the world.\"\nHer sincerity made my eyes sting, but I blinked the tears away. \"Thank you. That means so much to me.\"\nBenedicta sat on the edge of the bed, watching as the makeup artist made a few final touches. \"Have you heard from Luca?\" I asked, trying to sound casual, though my heart raced with anticipation.\nBenedicta shook her head. \"No, not yet. He hasn't said anything to me.\"\nI hesitated, glancing at the closed door. \"I'm thinking about stopping the wedding,\" I admitted quietly.\nHer eyes widened. \"Lia, what are you talking about?\"\nBefore I could explain, my phone buzzed on the table. My stomach dropped when I saw the name flashing on the screen. Luca. I snatched it up and answered quickly.\n\"Luca,\" I said, my voice trembling, \"what's going on?\"\nHis voice was calm but laced with urgency. \"Lia, listen to me carefully. There's someone out there more dangerous than Jenny and Bianca. You need to be extremely cautious.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, my fingers tightening around the phone.\n\"I don't have all the details yet, but I know this-whoever it is, they're pulling the strings behind the scenes. Until we figure it out, you have to push through with this wedding.\"\nI froze. \"Luca, I can't. I don't-\"\n\"You have to,\" he interrupted. \"If something goes wrong and you back out, they might blame you for it. Staying the course is your safest option right now.\"\nHis words made my head spin. \"And what about you? Where are you?\"\nThere was a pause, and then his tone shifted. \"Be prepared, Lia. My brotherAlpha Deanis in town.\"\nMy heart stopped. \"Dean? Why?\"\n\"I don't know yet,\" Luca admitted. \"But his presence changes everything. Keep your guard up, and I'll be in touch.\"\nThe line went dead before I could ask more questions.\nI stared at the phone, my hands trembling. Benedicta must have noticed my expression because she came over and took my hands in hers.\n\"Lia, what is it?\" she asked gently.\nI swallowed hard, repeating Luca's words. \"He said there's someone more dangerous out there, andhis brother, Dean, is in town.\"\nBenedicta's face tightened, but her voice was steady. \"Then we'll deal with it, Lia. You're not alone in this.\"\n\"I don't know if I can go through with this wedding,\" I whispered, tears threatening to spill.\n\"You can,\" she said firmly. \"And you will. This is bigger than just you and Finn. Luca wouldn't ask you to do this if it wasn't important.\"\nI nodded, though uncertainty gnawed at me. Benedicta squeezed my hands and then motioned for the makeup artist to continue.\nAs the stylist worked, Benedicta sat beside me, her presence a source of comfort. \"Lia, you're stronger than you realize,\" she said softly. \"No matter what happens today, remember that.\"\nHer words gave me a small measure of confidence. I took a deep breath, letting the stylist finish pinning the veil into place.\nWhen I looked in the mirror again, I didn't just see a bride-I saw a woman about to walk into the unknown, determined to face whatever came her way.\n___\nAlina's POV\nThe phone trembled in my hand as I paced my room, my tone sharp and commanding. \"Listen carefully,\" I barked, my patience worn thin. \"I don't care what it takes. Lia must be dealt with tonight. If you fail, don't bother showing your face to me again. Do I make myself clear?\"\nA muffled response came from the other end, full of hesitation and fear. Typical.\n\"Good,\" I snapped, ending the call abruptly and tossing the phone onto my desk. My heart was pounding with anticipation, my mind racing through the plan. This wedding had to be her last day on earth. Lia had meddled far too much, and her existence was a threat I couldn't allow to continue.\nThe soft creak of my window brought me to a halt, my breath catching in my throat. Slowly, I turned toward the sound, and there he was-a man in a dark cloak, his back to me as he gracefully stepped into my room. The shadows seemed to cling to him as if they were an extension of his being.\nI didn't need to see his face to know who it was. My lips parted, the name escaping in a whisper tinged with unease. \"Alpha Dean.\"\nHe turned, the hood falling back to reveal his chiseled features and cold, piercing eyes. A cruel smile played on his lips as he regarded me, his presence overwhelming.\n\"Alina,\" he drawled, his voice smooth yet laced with menace. \"Still playing queen in a game you don't fully understand, I see.\"\nI straightened, trying to mask the unease curling in my stomach. \"What are you doing here? This wasn't part of the plan.\"\nDean chuckled darkly, stepping closer with an air of predatory confidence. \"Plans change. Especially when they're as uninspired as yours.\"\nHis words stung, but I held my ground. \"Lia has to go. She's a threat to everything we've worked for. You agreed to this!\"\nHis smile widened, but it didn't reach his eyes. \"Oh, I agree. But I've had a change of heart.\"\nI frowned, confusion flickering across my face. \"What are you talking about?\"\nDean leaned against the edge of my desk, his movements slow and deliberate. \"Why kill Lia,\" he began, \"when I can break her instead? Killing her would be quick, painless too easy. But keeping her alive, taking her as my pet Now that's a punishment worthy of Luca's betrayal.\"\nMy heart skipped a beat at his words, my mind struggling to process his twisted logic. \"You can't be serious,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\"Oh, I am.\" Dean's eyes glittered with dark amusement. \"Imagine Luca's face when he sees the love of his life in my grasp, completely under my control. The pain, the helplessness It'll be delicious.\"\nMy stomach churned. This was beyond anything I had anticipated. \"Dean, this wasn't the deal. We were supposed to eliminate her, not this.\"\nHe tilted his head, his expression hardening. \"Are you questioning me, Alina?\"\nI swallowed hard, my throat suddenly dry. \"No,\" I said quickly. \"Of course not. But-\"\n\"There are no 'buts,'\" he interrupted, his tone icy. \"You wanted Lia out of the picture, and I've found a way to do it that serves both our interests. You want her gone; I want Luca to suffer. Everyone wins.\"\nI hesitated, my mind racing with doubts. Dean's plan was dangerous and unpredictable. It could backfire in ways we couldn't anticipate. But then again, opposing him was even more dangerous.\n\"What do you need me to do?\" I asked, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside me.\nDean's smile returned, sharp and predatory. \"Nothing, for now. Just keep playing your part and leave the rest to me.\"\nI nodded reluctantly, my instincts screaming at me to be cautious. \"Fine. But you'll need to stay hidden until the time is right. Luca is already suspicious, and Lia isn't as naive as you think.\"\nDean chuckled, pushing off the desk and moving toward the shadows. \"Oh, I'm counting on it. The more they squirm, the sweeter the victory.\"\nHe disappeared as quickly as he had appeared, leaving me alone with my thoughts. I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves.\nThis wasn't what I had planned, but Dean's ruthlessness might just be the edge we needed to end this once and for all. Still, a nagging voice in the back of my mind warned me that we were playing with fire, and if we weren't careful, we'd all get burned.\n133\nFinn's POV\nThe wedding bells rang loud and clear, echoing through the grand hall. My heart should have been soaring, but unease clung to me like a shadow. As the doors opened, Lia walked in, her arm linked with Benedicta's. She looked stunning in her gown, but there was a tension in her smile that only I seemed to notice.\nAs we exchanged vows, her voice was steady, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. The officiant's words blurred as my wolf instincts screamed at me, warning of impending danger. Still, I pushed the unease aside. This was our moment, and I wouldn't let anything ruin it.\n\"You may now kiss the bride,\" the officiant announced.\nI leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Lia's lips. The applause erupted around us, but all I could think about was the gnawing sensation that something was about to go terribly wrong.\nThe reception was a whirlwind of laughter and celebration. Guests filled the hall, the sound of clinking glasses and cheerful chatter blending with the music. Lia sat beside me, her eyes distant as if her mind was miles away.\n\"Are you okay?\" I leaned closer, keeping my voice low.\nShe nodded quickly, forcing a smile. \"I'm fine. Just a bit tired.\"\nI didn't believe her, but I didn't push. Something had been bothering her all day, but she wouldn't tell me what it was.\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw Bianca storming out of the hall, her face a mask of fury. Jenny followed closely behind her, whispering something that only seemed to anger Bianca more.\n\"What now?\" I muttered under my breath.\nI glanced at Lia again. She was staring down at her plate, absentmindedly pushing food around with her fork. Across the room, Alina sat alone, a smug smile on her face as if she knew a secret the rest of us didn't.\n\"Excuse me,\" I said, rising from my seat. Lia barely acknowledged me, still lost in her thoughts.\nI made my way toward the doors, following the path Bianca and Jenny had taken. The hallway was empty, but the faint sound of voices reached my ears. I focused, letting my heightened wolf senses guide me.\nTheir voices became clearer as I approached.\n\"We should have gotten rid of Lia when we had the chance,\" Bianca hissed.\n\"Now she's married,\" Jenny replied, her tone laced with frustration. \"And there's nothing we can do about it. Not to mention that we have a murderer on our tail. This is spiraling out of control!\"\nMy breath caught. A murderer? What were they talking about?\nThe realization hit me like a punch to the gut. They had been plotting something against Lia all along, and now it seemed their plans were unraveling.\nI turned to leave, my mind racing. I had to warn Lia. But before I could take a step, a sharp pain exploded in my chest.\nI looked down, shocked to see the glint of a blade protruding from my ribs. Blood poured from the wound, staining my shirt.\nGasping, I turned to face my attacker. A masked figure stood before me, their eyes cold and calculating.\n\"W-why?\" I choked out, my voice barely above a whisper.\nThe figure said nothing, pulling the knife free with a sickening sound. I staggered, clutching my chest as the world around me blurred.\nFootsteps echoed in the distance, but my vision was fading fast. The last thing I saw was the masked figure disappearing into the shadows, leaving me alone in the hallway, drowning in my own blood.\n____\nAlina's POV\nFinn had been gone for too long. At first, I dismissed it as him taking a moment to himself-it wasn't unusual for him to step away from the chaos of a crowded event. But as the minutes dragged on, unease began to creep in.\nI pushed my glass aside and stood up, ignoring the curious glances thrown my way.\n\"Where are you going?\" one of the guests asked, but I waved them off.\n\"Just checking on Finn,\" I said curtly, already moving toward the doors.\nThe air outside was crisp, the moon casting an eerie glow over the surrounding grounds. I called Finn's name, my voice firm but tinged with growing worry.\n\"Finn?\"\nNo answer.\nMy heart started pounding harder as I ventured farther away from the reception. Every step seemed to amplify the tension curling in my stomach. Something was wrong-I could feel it in my bones.\nSuddenly, a muffled scream pierced the quiet night. My instincts kicked in, and I broke into a run, following the sound. My heels clicked against the stone pathway, but I barely noticed.\n\"Finn!\" I shouted, my voice now frantic.\nI rounded a corner and froze.\nThere, lying on the ground, was Finn. Blood soaked his shirt, pooling around him. Bianca and Jenny stood nearby, their faces pale and panicked.\n\"What the hell have you done to him?\" I snarled, my voice trembling with rage as I rushed to Finn's side.\nBianca raised her hands defensively. \"We didn't do anything! We found him like this.\"\nJenny nodded fervently. \"She's telling the truth. We just got here and saw him like this.\"\nI ignored them, dropping to my knees beside Finn. His breathing was shallow, his face pale. My heart clenched at the sight of him so vulnerable.\n\"You're lying,\" I spat, glaring up at them. \"You were planning something, weren't you? Against Lia? And now this?\"\nBianca stepped back, shaking her head. \"We swear, Alina. We didn't touch him!\"\nI looked down at Finn, brushing a stray lock of hair from his face. My hands trembled as I fought to steady my breathing.\n\"If he dies,\" I said coldly, my gaze snapping back to them, \"you're both dead. Now, help me get him back to his room.\"\nJenny hesitated but eventually nodded. \"I'll call the sentinels,\" she murmured, pulling out her phone.\nBianca and I carefully lifted Finn's limp form. His blood smeared on my hands, warm and sticky, but I didn't care. My mind was racing, a thousand questions and accusations swirling through my thoughts.\nWe reached Finn's room, the sentinels following close behind to help lay him down on the bed. His breathing remained faint, and every shallow rise and fall of his chest made my stomach twist.\n\"I'll get a doctor,\" I said sharply, turning to leave.\nBefore I could step out, Lia appeared in the doorway, her face etched with confusion and concern.\n\"What happened?\" she asked, her voice trembling. Her gaze flickered to Finn's pale face, then to me.\nI couldn't contain the rage bubbling inside me. My eyes narrowed, and I stepped closer to her, my voice low and venomous.\n\"If Finn doesn't make it out of this alive,\" I said, my words cutting through the tension like a blade, \"get ready to die.\"\nLia's eyes widened, and for a moment, she looked like she wanted to say something. But I didn't wait for her response. I stormed past her, my mind already focused on finding a doctor and getting answers.\nBecause someone would pay for this-if not Bianca or Jenny, then whoever else had dared to harm my brother.\n134\nLia's POV\nThe chaos outside was deafening. Shouts echoed through the halls, and the tension in the air was so thick it felt like I could cut it with a knife. Finn's injury had thrown the entire pack into disarray, and the sight of Alina's cold, accusing eyes earlier kept replaying in my mind.\nI forced myself to move, my feet carrying me to Benedicta, who stood near the staircase, trying to make sense of the chaos. She turned the moment she saw me, her face a mix of worry and determination.\n\"Benedicta,\" I whispered, my voice shaking. \"I need to talk to you. Now.\"\nWithout waiting for a response, I grabbed her hand and pulled her toward my bedroom. I shut the door behind us and locked it, leaning against it as I tried to steady my racing heart.\n\"This is bad,\" I muttered, pacing the room. \"This is really bad.\"\nBenedicta watched me with a calmness I envied. \"Take a breath, Lia,\" she said gently. \"Tell me what happened.\"\nI stopped pacing and faced her. \"Alina she's going to blame me. I know it. She as much as said it downstairs.\"\nBenedicta's brows knitted together. \"She said that?\"\nI nodded, wrapping my arms around myself. \"She told me to 'get ready to die' if Finn doesn't make it. And now the whole pack is in chaos, and I-\"\nI broke off as my phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out with trembling hands and saw Luca's name on the screen. Relief flooded through me as I answered.\n\"Luca,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\"What's going on?\" he asked immediately. His voice was calm but laced with concern.\nI sank onto the edge of the bed, my free hand gripping the bedsheet. \"It's Finn,\" I said, my words tumbling out in a rush. \"Someone stabbed him. He's he's alive, but barely. And Alina is going to put the blame on me. She's already-\"\n\"Lia,\" Luca interrupted, his voice firm. \"Calm down. Just tell me everything.\"\nI took a shaky breath and recounted what had happened, from finding Finn injured to Alina's cold threats. When I finished, there was silence on the other end of the line.\n\"Luca?\"\n\"I've heard something,\" he said finally. \"I just got the news that Alpha Dean might be in town.\"\n\"Dean?\" I repeated my voice barely above a whisper. My stomach twisted at the mention of Luca's brother. \"Are you sure?\"\n\"No,\" he admitted. \"There haven't been any confirmed sightings, but there are whispers. If he's here, he's keeping a low profile.\"\nI swallowed hard, my mind racing. \"Do you think he did this? Do you think Dean stabbed Finn?\"\n\"It's possible,\" Luca said, his tone grim. \"Dean has always had his own agenda. And if he's involved, this is just the beginning.\"\nMy heart sank at his words. \"What do we do?\"\n\"For now, you need to stay calm and stay safe,\" he said. \"Don't confront Alina or anyone else. Let them speculate all they want, but don't give them any reason to turn their suspicions into accusations. I'll handle things on my end.\"\nI nodded, even though he couldn't see me. \"Okay.\"\n\"And Lia,\" he added, his voice softening, \"don't lose hope. We'll figure this out.\"\n\"Thank you, Luca,\" I whispered.\nAfter the call ended, I sat there for a moment, staring at the phone in my hand. The weight of everything felt crushing, but I couldn't afford to fall apart now.\nBenedicta sat beside me, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder. \"What did he say?\"\nI told her about Dean and Luca's suspicions. Her expression darkened, but she didn't let the worry show for long.\n\"Lia,\" she said firmly, \"you need to trust that everything will fall into place. Luca is right. Don't confront anyone. Just focus on staying strong.\"\nI looked at her, searching for reassurance in her steady gaze. \"But what if Alina\"\n\"She won't,\" Benedicta said, cutting me off. \"Because we won't let her. You're not alone in this, Lia.\"\nHer words were a small comfort, but the dread in my chest refused to dissipate. As Benedicta helped me calm down and began going over plans to ensure my safety, I couldn't shake the feeling that things were about to get worse.\nAnd if Dean was really here, then chaos was only just beginning.\n____\nAlina's POV\nI stormed into my bedroom, slamming the door behind me. My heart pounded as I headed straight for the closet, throwing the door open. There he was, seated on a small stool like he had all the time in the world, his black cloak draped over his shoulders and a smug grin playing on his lips.\n\"Dean,\" I said sharply, stepping inside and closing the closet door behind me.\nHis piercing eyes lifted to meet mine, his grin widening. \"Ah, sister dear,\" he said mockingly, \"to what do I owe the pleasure of this late-night visit?\"\nI folded my arms, glaring at him. \"We need to talk. Finn's been attacked.\"\nHis grin faltered for a moment, replaced by a curious tilt of his head. \"Oh? And how is the great Alpha Finn faring?\"\n\"He's alive,\" I snapped, my voice trembling with frustration. \"But barely. He's unconscious, and no one knows who's responsible. I came here because I need your help.\"\nDean leaned back, his expression unreadable. \"My condolences,\" he said with a feigned solemnity that made my blood boil.\nI took a step forward, clenching my fists. \"Don't you dare,\" I hissed. \"My brother is not dead, and he won't be. I need you to use your connections, your resources, whatever it takes to find out who did this.\"\nFor a moment, Dean said nothing. Then he stood, towering over me, his cloak brushing the floor. \"And why, dear sister, should I involve myself in this pack drama? What's in it for me?\"\nI swallowed hard, pushing down my fear. \"Because if Finn dies, this pack will fall apart. And if it falls apart, your little plans for Lia will crumble with it. You said it yourself-you need this pack stable for your schemes to work.\"\nHis grin returned, sharp and predatory. \"Ah, so you do listen.\" He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Very well, Alina. I'll help you find this mystery culprit. But I expect something in return.\"\n\"Anything,\" I said quickly, desperation seeping into my tone.\n\"Good,\" he said, his grin widening. \"Now, about Lia\"\nI cut him off, shaking my head. \"You can't take her. Not now. This attack changes everything. If you try to abduct her now, it will only draw suspicion. You'll have to wait for a better opportunity.\"\nDean's eyes narrowed slightly, but he didn't argue. Instead, he stepped back, his grin fading into a thoughtful expression. \"Fine,\" he said after a moment. \"I'll wait. But don't keep me waiting too long, Alina. My patience is not infinite.\"\nWith that, he turned and sat back down, dismissing me with a wave of his hand. I took a deep breath, my hands trembling as I opened the closet door and stepped back into my bedroom.\nAs I walked out into the hallway, I spotted Bianca and Jenny skulking near Finn's bedroom door. My blood boiled at the sight of them.\n\"What do you think you're doing?\" I snapped, striding toward them.\nThey turned to face me, their expressions a mixture of surprise and annoyance.\n\"We just wanted to check on him,\" Bianca said, her tone overly sweet.\n\"Don't play innocent with me,\" I hissed, stepping closer. \"I know what you two are up to. You've been scheming against Lia since the beginning, and now my brother is lying unconscious because of your incompetence. Did you plan to kill her and end up harming him instead? Or was this just collateral damage?\"\nJenny's eyes widened, and she took a step back, but Bianca held her ground, her jaw tightening.\n\"We had nothing to do with this,\" Bianca said, her voice cold.\n\"I don't believe you,\" I shot back. \"You can deny it all you want, but I'll get to the truth. And if I find out you're behind this, I swear I'll make you pay. Both of you.\"\nJenny grabbed Bianca's arm, pulling her back. \"Come on, let's go,\" she muttered, clearly shaken.\nBianca hesitated, glaring at me, but eventually allowed Jenny to lead her away.\nI watched them disappear down the hallway, my hands clenched into fists. I turned back toward Finn's room, taking a deep breath to steady myself.\nThe pack was in chaos, my brother's life hung by a thread, and danger lurked around every corner. But one thing was clear-I wouldn't rest until I uncovered the truth. And when I did, whoever was responsible would regret crossing me.\n135\nBianca's POV\nThe tension in the air was suffocating. Every corner of the pack house buzzed with whispers of Finn's attack, and I couldn't move without feeling a dozen eyes boring into my back. Jenny and I had barely made it out of that hallway alive after Alina's confrontation. I wasn't scared of her, but her words stuck in my head.\n\"Did we mess up?\" Jenny asked nervously as we entered my room and closed the door behind us. She sat on the edge of the bed, her hands twisting anxiously in her lap.\nI leaned against the dresser, crossing my arms. \"No,\" I said firmly, though the tightness in my chest said otherwise. \"We've been careful. We didn't stab Finn. Someone else did. Alina's just lashing out because she's desperate.\"\n\"But what if she's right?\" Jenny's voice cracked. \"What if whoever stabbed Finn was aiming for Lia? What if we're next?\"\nI turned to her, my glare silencing her panicked rambling. \"We are not next. Whoever did this has no reason to come after us unless you do something stupid like freak out.\"\nJenny nodded but didn't look convinced.\nI paced the room, my mind racing. This wasn't how things were supposed to go. Lia was the target, not Finn. Now everything was upside down, and the pack was on edge. If Alina decided to dig too deep, she could uncover secrets that would destroy us both.\nMy phone buzzed on the dresser, pulling me out of my thoughts. I grabbed it, glancing at the screen. It was a message from my investigator.\n\"I found something. Sending it now.\"\nA few seconds later, a video came through. My heart pounded as I opened it, the screen filling with grainy security footage.\nAt first, it was hard to make out, but then I saw him. Luca. He was entering Lex's house the night everything went to hell. A slow smile spread across my lips.\n\"Gotcha,\" I muttered under my breath.\n\"What is it?\" Jenny asked, standing to peer over my shoulder.\nI quickly locked my phone and shoved it into my pocket. \"Nothing. Just some pack gossip.\"\nJenny frowned but didn't press further.\n\"Listen,\" I said, shifting the conversation. \"We need to be smart about this. Finn's attack changes things, but it doesn't change our goal. Lia is still a problem, and we can't let her get comfortable. She's too close to Luca, and if those two start working together, they'll uncover everything.\"\n\"But what do we do now?\" Jenny asked, her voice shaking.\nI gave her a cold smile. \"We wait. Whoever attacked Finn is either an ally or an enemy we haven't identified yet. Either way, they've given us an opportunity. The pack is distracted, and Alina's too focused on revenge to see what's right in front of her.\"\nJenny still looked unsure, but she nodded. \"Okay. What about Alina?\"\nI laughed dryly. \"Alina's predictable. She'll make threats and stomp around like she owns the place, but she won't act without proof. All we have to do is stay one step ahead of her.\"\nJenny sighed, looking slightly more relaxed. \"I hope you're right.\"\n\"I am,\" I said confidently. \"Now go. I need to make a few calls.\"\nJenny hesitated, but eventually nodded and left the room.\nAs soon as the door clicked shut, I pulled out my phone and opened the video again. I watched it closely this time, noting every detail. Luca wasn't just at Lex's house; he looked agitated, almost frantic. He knew something.\nI made a quick call to my investigator.\n\"Who else has seen this?\" I demanded the moment he picked up.\n\"No one,\" he replied. \"You said to send it to you first.\"\n\"Good. Keep it that way. I'll let you know if I need anything else.\"\nI hung up and leaned against the dresser, my mind racing.\nLuca's involvement complicated things, but it also gave me leverage. If he was connected to Lex's death, then I had a weapon I could use against him and Lia. But I had to be careful. If I played this wrong, it could blow up in my face.\nAs I considered my next move, the door creaked open, and Jenny peeked in.\n\"What now?\" I snapped, irritated by the interruption.\n\"There's a meeting in the main hall,\" she said nervously. \"Alina called it.\"\nI rolled my eyes. \"Of course, she did. Fine, let's go.\"\nJenny and I made our way to the hall, where the pack had already gathered. Alina stood at the front, her eyes blazing with anger and determination.\n\"I don't care what it takes,\" she was saying as we entered. \"Whoever did this to my brother will pay. And if anyone here is hiding something, now is the time to come forward.\"\nHer eyes swept over the crowd, lingering on me for a moment before moving on.\nI met her gaze with a smirk, daring her to say something. She didn't.\nAs the meeting continued, I felt my confidence returning. Alina could bluster all she wanted, but she didn't have proof. And as long as I had that video, I held the upper hand.\nWhen the meeting ended, I slipped away, my mind already planning my next move. Lia and Luca thought they were safe, but they had no idea what was coming.\nI smiled to myself as I headed back to my room. The game was far from over, and I intended to win.\n___\nLia's POV\nThe hallways felt eerily quiet as I made my way to Finn's room. The entire pack house was in chaos earlier, but now it seemed like the air itself was holding its breath. My steps faltered as I neared the door, dread pooling in my stomach. Finn was injured, and no one had any answers.\nI pushed the door open gently and stepped inside. The room was dim, lit only by the soft glow of a bedside lamp. Finn lay on the bed, his face pale and motionless, bandages wrapped around his chest. Seeing him like this sent a pang through my heart. This wasn't the strong, commanding Finn I knew.\nI approached the bed and stood by his side, my fingers hesitating over his hand before finally resting on it.\n\"Finn\" I whispered though I knew he couldn't hear me. \"I'm so sorry this happened to you. I wish I could fix it.\"\nThe guilt weighed heavy on me. If it weren't for me, he wouldn't be in this state. This attack was meant for me-I was sure of it.\nThe door creaked open behind me, and I turned to see Alina stride in, her expression a mix of anger and suspicion. She stopped a few feet away, crossing her arms over her chest.\n\"What are you doing here?\" she demanded, her tone icy.\n\"I came to check on him,\" I said quietly, trying to keep my voice calm.\nShe scoffed. \"You've done enough damage already. Don't you think it's time you leave my brother alone?\"\nHer words stung, but I forced myself to hold my ground. \"I didn't hurt Finn, Alina. I care about him.\"\n\"Care?\" she repeated, her voice dripping with sarcasm. \"If you cared, he wouldn't be lying there, fighting for his life.\"\n\"That's not fair,\" I snapped, the weight of her accusations finally breaking my resolve. \"I didn't stab him. I would never hurt him!\"\n\"Would you?\" She took a step closer, her eyes narrowing. \"Because ever since you came into our lives, everything has been chaos. My brother's been distracted, this pack is falling apart, and now he's on the brink of death. Tell me, Lia, how exactly are you not to blame?\"\nI clenched my fists, anger, and frustration bubbling inside me. \"I didn't ask for any of this! Do you think I want to be hunted? Do you think I want people trying to kill me? I'm as much a victim in this as Finn is!\"\n\"Victim?\" Alina laughed bitterly. \"You're not a victim, Lia. You're a curse.\"\nHer words hit harder than I expected, and for a moment, I couldn't find a response. The silence between us was thick, broken only by the soft sound of Finn's breathing.\nFinally, I spoke, my voice quieter but firm. \"You can blame me all you want, but it doesn't change the fact that someone out there is targeting this pack. You're wasting time pointing fingers when we should be finding out who's responsible.\"\nAlina's eyes flashed with anger, but she didn't immediately respond. Instead, she turned her attention to Finn, her expression softening slightly as she looked at him.\n\"I'll find out who did this,\" she said, her voice lower but still filled with determination. \"And when I do, they'll pay. But if I find out you had anything to do with it, Lia you'll regret ever stepping foot in this pack.\"\nI met her gaze, refusing to back down. \"I didn't hurt him, Alina. And I'm not going anywhere until I know he's safe.\"\nFor a moment, we stared at each other, neither willing to back down. Then she turned on her heel and stormed out of the room, leaving me alone with Finn once more.\nI sank into the chair beside his bed, my hands trembling as I gripped the armrests. The argument with Alina had rattled me, but it also strengthened my resolve.\nWhoever was behind this attack wasn't going to win. Not if I had anything to say about it.\n136\nLia's POV\nI glanced at Finn one last time as he lay still on the bed, his breathing shallow but steady. My heart ached to see him like this. I wanted to stay, to keep watching over him, but Alina's accusations still lingered in my mind, making the air in the room feel suffocating.\nWith a heavy sigh, I turned to leave. Just as I reached the door, a flicker of movement caught my eye. The curtains by the window swayed gently, though there was no breeze. My heart skipped a beat, and I froze.\n\"Who's there?\" I called out, my voice firmer than I felt.\nSilence.\nI stepped closer, peering into the shadows near the window. \"I said, who's there?\"\nStill no response. I waited for a few tense moments, but nothing moved again. My mind began to race with possibilities. Was it just my imagination? Or was someone really there?\nShaking my head, I decided not to let paranoia take over. \"It's nothing,\" I muttered to myself, though the uneasy feeling didn't quite leave me.\nI stepped out of the room and made my way back to my bedroom. The hallways felt colder than usual, or maybe it was just my nerves playing tricks on me. When I pushed open the door to my room, I found Benedicta already asleep on the bed, her steady breathing a calming rhythm against the chaos in my mind.\nQuietly, I locked the door behind me, ensuring it was secure before sitting down on the edge of the bed. My thoughts were a mess, but one thing was clear-I needed answers. Without hesitation, I picked up my phone and dialed Luca's number.\nHe answered after a few rings, his voice low and cautious. \"Lia, is everything okay?\"\n\"No,\" I admitted, running a hand through my hair. \"It's not. I'm scared, Luca. Finn's still unconscious, Alina is convinced I'm to blame, and now\" I paused, unsure if I should mention the moving curtains. \"Now I feel like I'm being watched.\"\nLuca's tone sharpened. \"Watched? What do you mean?\"\nI hesitated. \"It's probably nothing, but I thought I saw something in Finn's room. The curtains moved, but there was no one there.\"\nHe was silent for a moment, then said, \"You're right to be cautious. This isn't just about Finn's attack. My investigation is pointing to something bigger.\"\nMy grip on the phone tightened. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"It seems like the same person who killed Lex might be behind Finn's shooting,\" Luca explained. \"Whoever it is, they're not just targeting random people. They know about Bianca, Jenny, you-and maybe more. They've been watching all of you.\"\nThe revelation sent chills down my spine. \"But why? What do they want?\"\n\"That's what I'm trying to figure out,\" he said, his frustration evident. \"Think, Lia. Is there anyone you've had a recent argument with? Someone who might have a reason to hurt you or the people around you?\"\nI didn't have to think long. One name came to mind instantly. \"Alina,\" I whispered.\n\"Alina?\" he repeated, his tone growing sharper.\n\"She's Finn's sister,\" I explained. \"She's never liked me, and today she made it clear she blames me for everything. She said I was a curse and even threatened me if Finn doesn't recover.\"\nLuca was silent for a moment before letting out a low growl. \"I need to go.\"\n\"Why? What is it?\" I asked, panic creeping into my voice.\n\"I think I've just found a suspect,\" he said firmly. \"If Alina's involved, I need to confirm it.\"\n\"No, wait-\"\nBut he had already hung up.\nI stared at the phone in disbelief, my heart racing. Could Alina really be behind all of this? It seemed unthinkable, but then again, she had always been cold toward me. She'd made it clear that she didn't want me in Finn's life.\nI leaned back against the headboard, trying to calm my breathing. Benedicta stirred slightly in her sleep but didn't wake. The room felt heavy, the shadows on the walls seeming to stretch and shift.\nIf Luca was right, and Alina was somehow involved, what did that mean for me? For Finn? For everyone else in the pack?\nI pressed a hand to my chest, willing my racing heart to slow. Luca would find answers-I trusted him. But the uneasy feeling in my gut told me that things were far from over.\nAnd if Alina really was the enemy, I had no idea how I was going to face her.\n____\nAlpha Dean's POV\nThe dim lighting of the room barely illuminated the sleeping figure of Finn. From his hiding place in the shadows, I watched him, the steady beeping of the machines keeping him alive grating on my nerves. A wolf-like him-a supposed alpha-reduced to this? Pathetic.\nIt was laughable that this weakling thought he could protect someone like Lia. My Lia. He didn't deserve her, and soon enough, he wouldn't even have the chance to try.\nI stepped out from the corner where I had been concealed, my boots making no sound against the floor. As I approached Finn's bed, the faint scent of antiseptic and weakness filled the air. The sight of him, pale and defenseless, filled me with satisfaction.\n\"You've always been in the way, Finn,\" I murmured, standing over him. My voice was low, but it carried the weight of my hatred. \"From the moment Lia entered your life, you've been nothing but a barrier. You thought you could marry her, make her yours? Foolish.\"\nI leaned closer, my lips curling into a sneer. \"She's mine. She's always been mine. And no one, not even you, will take her from me.\"\nMy hand moved to the pillow resting on the sofa beside the bed. Slowly, I picked it up, feeling the weight of it in my hands. I glanced at Finn one last time, his face peaceful in unconsciousness. It almost felt too easy.\nI reached over and turned off the machine providing him with oxygen, the soft hiss of air coming to a halt. The room fell into a tense silence, broken only by the faint hum of the heart monitor.\n\"Don't worry,\" I said mockingly, pressing the pillow firmly over his face. \"This won't take long.\"\nFinn stirred weakly, his body instinctively struggling against the lack of air. His movements were feeble and uncoordinated, and it only made me press harder.\n\"You were never strong enough to be alpha,\" I snarled, leaning more of my weight onto the pillow. \"And you'll never be strong enough to keep her.\"\nThe heart monitor's beeping quickened for a moment before it began to slow, each interval growing longer and longer. Finn's struggles ceased, his body falling still beneath my hands. The monitor emitted a long, steady tone-a flatline.\nI stayed there for a moment, letting the silence sink in, the weight of my actions settling comfortably in my chest. A dark smile spread across my face as I removed the pillow and stepped back, surveying my work.\nFinn was gone.\n\"That's one obstacle out of the way,\" I said softly, almost to myself.\nI adjusted the pillow back on the sofa, ensuring it looked undisturbed, and glanced around the room to confirm there were no signs of struggle. Everything was as it should be.\nAs I walked toward the door, I couldn't help but smile. Lia would be mine. It was only a matter of time.\nNo one would stand in my way-not Finn, not Alina, not even Luca. This was just the beginning.\n137\nAlina's POV\nThe piercing scream of a maid echoed through the pack house, jolting me from my thoughts. My heart leaped into my throat, and I instinctively rushed toward the source of the commotion. The hallway was alive with murmurs, tension thick in the air as I approached Finn's room.\n\"What's happening?\" I demanded, pushing past a group of maids clustered near the doorway.\nThe sight before me stole the breath from my lungs. Finn lay still on his bed, his chest unmoving. The monitor that had been beeping steadily earlier now emitted a deafening flatline.\n\"No!\" I shouted, rushing to his side. My hands shook as I pressed them against his lifeless form as if my touch alone could bring him back. \"Finn! Wake up!\"\nOne of the maids stepped forward hesitantly, tears streaming down her face. \"H-he's gone, Miss Alina. We... we found him like this.\"\nI turned to her, my voice trembling with fury and disbelief. \"Gone? What do you mean gone? He was stable just a few hours ago!\"\nAnother maid whispered, \"His oxygen machine was off. It looks like someone turned it off deliberately.\"\nThe realization hit me like a ton of bricks. Someone had done this. Someone had killed my brother.\nJust then, the sound of hurried footsteps reached my ears. I turned to see Lia entering the room, her face pale with confusion and fear.\n\"You,\" I spat, my voice laced with venom as I pointed an accusing finger at her. \"You did this, didn't you? You couldn't wait to get rid of him!\"\nLia's eyes widened in shock. \"What? No, I-\"\n\"Don't you dare deny it!\" I screamed, cutting her off. \"You've been nothing but trouble since the moment you stepped foot in this house. My brother trusted you, and you repaid him with betrayal. You're nothing but a murderer!\"\nLia's voice cracked as she tried to defend herself. \"Alina, I didn't do this! I loved Finn-\"\n\"Don't you dare say his name!\" I roared. \"If it weren't for you, he'd still be alive!\"\nThe tension in the room was suffocating, the maids whispering among themselves as they watched the confrontation unfold. Before Lia could respond, a sentinel entered the room, bowing slightly before addressing me.\n\"The elders have summoned an emergency meeting in the council chamber,\" he said gravely.\nI straightened, my anger simmering just beneath the surface. \"Good. Maybe they'll finally do something about her,\" I said, casting one last glare at Lia before storming out of the room.\nThe council chamber was already filled with murmuring voices when I arrived. The elders, their faces etched with concern, sat at the head of the table, their presence commanding the room's attention.\nMoments later, Lia entered, followed closely by Bianca and Jenny. The sight of them made my blood boil.\n\"You!\" I shouted, pointing at Bianca and Jenny as they tried to slink into the room unnoticed. \"What are you even doing here? Do you think I don't know what you've been up to?\"\nBianca raised an eyebrow, feigning innocence. \"Alina, what are you talking about?\"\n\"Don't play dumb with me!\" I snapped. \"You've been scheming against Lia since the beginning. And now, Finn is dead! Did you think I wouldn't put the pieces together?\"\nJenny scoffed, crossing her arms over her chest. \"You're letting your emotions cloud your judgment, Alina. We had nothing to do with this.\"\n\"Liar!\" I screamed, slamming my hands down on the table. \"You've been plotting to get rid of her for weeks. Maybe you were aiming for Lia and got Finn instead, or maybe you wanted them both gone. Either way, I won't rest until I find out the truth.\"\nThe elders exchanged wary glances, one of them raising a hand to calm the room. \"Alina, we understand your grief, but accusations without proof will not help us resolve this situation.\"\n\"Proof?\" I laughed bitterly. \"You want proof? Look no further than these two snakes,\" I said, pointing at Bianca and Jenny. \"They've been meddling in everything from the start.\"\nBianca glared at me, her composure slipping. \"Be careful with your words, Alina. You don't want to make enemies you can't handle.\"\n\"Oh, trust me,\" I shot back. \"You've been my enemy for a long time. And when I find out exactly what role you played in my brother's death, you'll regret ever stepping foot in this pack.\"\nThe elders intervened, their voices firm as they called for order in the room. But my fury couldn't be contained. I didn't trust Lia. I didn't trust Bianca or Jenny. And until I uncovered the truth, none of them were safe from my wrath.\nAs the meeting continued, I vowed to myself that I would get justice for Finn, no matter the cost. Even if it meant tearing this entire pack apart to find the person responsible.\n___\nLia's POV\nMy hands trembled as I dialed Luca's number, pacing back and forth in my room. The packed house was in chaos, and I could feel the weight of the accusations hurled at me earlier by Alina. Finn's death had turned everything upside down, and now I was the target of everyone's anger and suspicion.\n\"Luca, thank God you picked up,\" I said the moment he answered, my voice quivering with urgency.\n\"What happened, Lia?\" he asked, his tone steady but concerned.\nI quickly recounted everything-the maid's scream, Finn's death, Alina's accusations, and the looming meeting with the elders. My voice cracked as I reached the part where Alina had called me a murderer.\n\"She's blaming me, Luca. She thinks I killed Finn,\" I said, struggling to hold back my tears.\n\"Lia, listen to me,\" Luca said firmly, his voice a calming presence amid the chaos. \"I need you to stay put. Don't confront anyone or make any rash decisions. This isn't the time to act on emotion. I'll handle this.\"\n\"But, Luca-\"\n\"Trust me, Lia,\" he interrupted. \"I'll get to the bottom of this. For now, just stay where you are, and don't let anyone provoke you. You're not alone in this.\"\nI nodded, even though he couldn't see me. \"Okay. Please, just hurry.\"\n\"I will,\" he promised before the line went dead.\nI turned to find Benedicta sitting on the edge of my bed, her expression one of quiet determination. She had been with me since the chaos erupted, a steadfast presence that kept me from completely unraveling.\n\"Luca's right,\" she said softly, taking my hand. \"You need to stay calm. Alina's grief is clouding her judgment, but the truth will come out eventually. You're innocent, Lia.\"\nHer words were meant to comfort me, but they barely made a dent in the storm of emotions raging inside me. Before I could respond, the door to my room slammed open, and Bianca and Jenny stormed in, their faces twisted with anger.\n\"How dare you?\" Bianca seethed, her voice loud and grating. \"How dare you come into this pack and destroy everything?\"\n\"You've been nothing but trouble since the moment you arrived,\" Jenny added, her tone dripping with disdain. \"And now Finn is dead. Do you think we're going to let you get away with this?\"\nI stepped back, the venom in their words hitting me like a slap. \"I didn't do anything!\" I snapped, my voice rising.\nBianca scoffed, stepping closer. \"Don't play innocent, Lia. We know what you're capable of. You've been a thorn in everyone's side, and now you've gone too far.\"\nTheir accusations ignited a fire inside me, and I clenched my fists at my sides. \"You want to talk about going too far?\" I said, my voice shaking with fury. \"I know what you've been up to. I know you planned to kill me.\"\nBoth women froze, their eyes widening in shock. \"What are you talking about?\" Jenny asked, her voice quieter now.\n\"Don't play dumb,\" I spat. \"I overheard you two talking. You wanted me out of the way, and now Finn is dead because of your schemes. I've kept quiet for too long, but not anymore. I'm going to the elders, and I'm telling them everything.\"\nPanic flashed across Bianca's face, but she quickly masked it with anger. \"You don't have any proof,\" she said, her voice trembling slightly.\n\"I don't need proof,\" I shot back. \"The elders will investigate, and when they find out the truth, you'll pay for what you've done.\"\nBenedicta stepped forward, placing a steadying hand on my arm. \"That's enough, Lia,\" she said gently. \"Don't let them bait you.\"\nI took a deep breath, realizing she was right. Bianca and Jenny weren't worth losing my composure over.\n\"I've said what I needed to say,\" I told them, my voice calmer now but no less resolute. \"You can leave.\"\nFor a moment, neither of them moved their faces a mixture of anger and fear. Then, without another word, they turned and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind them.\nBenedicta sighed, giving my hand a reassuring squeeze. \"You did the right thing, standing up to them. But now you need to be prepared for whatever comes next.\"\nI nodded, my resolve hardening. \"I won't let them pin this on me, Benedicta. I didn't kill Finn, and I won't let them ruin my life.\"\nWith her by my side, I felt a flicker of hope amid the chaos. The road ahead would be treacherous, but I was determined to fight for the truth.\n138\nBianca's POV\nThe air in the pack house was suffocating, laden with tension so thick it was nearly tangible. Finn's death had cast a dark shadow over everything, and it was a matter of time before accusations and suspicions boiled over. My hands trembled as I paced my room, my mind racing.\nThis wasn't part of the plan.\nJenny sat on the bed, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, her face pale but defiant. \"Bianca, this is getting out of hand. Lia knows something. She practically accused us in front of Benedicta.\"\nI whirled on her, my voice sharp. \"And what exactly do you think we should do about it? Go to the elders and confess? Because that's what your panicking sounds like.\"\nJenny flinched, her composure cracking. \"No, but if Alina starts digging, we're finished. She's furious. She'll turn over every stone to find out who killed Finn, and when she does, we'll be the first ones she looks at.\"\nI clenched my jaw, staring out the window. The moonlight illuminated the pack grounds, tranquil and deceptive. Inside, chaos brewed.\n\"Let her look,\" I said finally, my voice cold. \"Let her throw her tantrums and hurl accusations. We didn't kill Finn, and she won't find anything linking us to his death.\"\n\"But we-\"\n\"Enough!\" I snapped, my patience fraying. \"We aimed for Lia, not Finn. And now Finn's dead. That complicates things, yes, but it doesn't mean we fold. We stick to the story, keep our heads down, and let this storm blow over.\"\nJenny hesitated, uncertainty written all over her face. \"And what if it doesn't blow over? What if Alina gets to the truth?\"\nI turned to her, my eyes narrowing. \"Then we make sure she doesn't. We've come too far to let everything unravel now.\"\nThe silence that followed was heavy, but Jenny nodded reluctantly. I knew she was scared. Hell, I was too. But fear was a luxury I couldn't afford. Not now.\nAlina's POV\nThe crackle of the fire in the library offered no comfort as I sat across from Dean. His face was a mask of quiet fury, his sharp features illuminated by the flickering flames.\n\"My brother is dead,\" I said, breaking the silence, my voice heavy with barely contained rage. \"And no one is telling me anything. Not the elders, not the sentinels-no one. It's like they're trying to sweep this under the rug.\"\nDean leaned forward, his intense gaze locking onto mine. \"They won't. Not if we don't let them.\"\nI clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms. \"I can't believe this is happening. Finn... he was supposed to recover. He was supposed to lead this pack again. And now...\" My voice broke, and I looked away, swallowing the lump in my throat.\nDean reached out, his hand covering mine. \"I know how much he meant to you, Alina. We'll find out who did this. Whoever they are, they won't get away with it.\"\nI nodded, grateful for his steady presence. \"I need your help, Dean. I can't do this alone.\"\n\"Of course,\" he said firmly. \"But we need to be smart about this. Whoever killed Finn isn't going to just confess. They'll cover their tracks, and we'll need to dig deep to uncover the truth.\"\nI sat back, trying to piece everything together. \"The maids said his oxygen was turned off. That means whoever did it was in the room. They had to be someone who could get close to him without raising suspicion.\"\nDean frowned, his mind clearly working through the possibilities. \"You think it was someone from the pack?\"\nI hesitated, the thought twisting my stomach. \"I don't want to believe it, but who else could it be? An outsider wouldn't have had the opportunity. Someone here killed my brother, and they need to pay for it.\"\nDean nodded slowly. \"Then we start with the obvious suspects. Who would have had something to gain from Finn's death?\"\n\"Lia,\" I said immediately, bitterness lacing my words. \"She's been nothing but a thorn in our side. She was in the room right after it happened, and she's been causing problems since the moment she arrived.\"\nDean considered this, but his expression remained neutral. \"Lia has been a source of tension, yes. But killing Finn? That's a bold move, even for her. We can't let personal feelings cloud our judgment, Alina.\"\nI bristled, but he was right. As much as I despised Lia, we needed evidence, not just suspicions.\n\"Bianca and Jenny,\" I said after a moment. \"They've been scheming for weeks. They hated Lia, and they might have seen Finn as collateral damage.\"\nDean's jaw tightened. \"If they're involved, we'll find out. But we'll need to tread carefully. Accusing them outright could backfire. They'll close ranks if they feel threatened.\"\n\"Then we don't accuse them,\" I said, a plan forming in my mind. \"We watch them. We listen. If they're guilty, they'll slip up eventually.\"\nDean's lips curved into a faint smile. \"Now you're thinking like a leader.\"\nDespite the gravity of the situation, his words warmed me. Finn had always been the leader, the one everyone looked to for guidance. Now, it was up to me to step into that role.\n\"Where do we start?\" I asked determination, hardening my resolve.\nDean leaned back, his eyes glinting with a mix of determination and something darker. \"We start by making them think we're not looking. Let them believe they've gotten away with it. People get careless when they think the heat is off.\"\nI nodded, a grim smile forming on my lips. \"And when they slip, we'll be ready.\"\nBianca's POV\nThe tension in the air was palpable as I entered the pack's main hall. The elders were speaking in hushed tones, their faces etched with concern. The weight of their scrutiny was suffocating, but I kept my expression neutral.\n\"Bianca,\" one of them said, gesturing for me to approach.\nI stepped forward, inclining my head respectfully. \"Elder Markus, how can I help you?\"\nHis sharp eyes bore into mine. \"There have been... troubling developments regarding Finn's death. The pack is in turmoil, and we need answers.\"\nI forced a look of concern onto my face. \"Of course, Elder. I'll do whatever I can to assist.\"\nMarkus studied me for a moment before nodding. \"See that you do. The pack's stability depends on it.\"\nI nodded and excused myself, my heart pounding as I left the hall. Jenny was waiting for me outside, her expression anxious.\n\"What did they want?\" she asked.\n\"Nothing we didn't already expect,\" I said tightly. \"They're looking for answers, and they're watching everyone closely. We need to be careful, Jenny. One wrong move, and we're done.\"\nJenny swallowed hard, her fear evident. \"What if they find out, Bianca? What if they figure out that we-\"\n\"They won't,\" I interrupted sharply. \"We didn't kill Finn. Let them investigate all they want. They'll find nothing.\"\nBut even as I said the words, doubt gnawed at me. Alina was relentless, and Dean's quiet intensity was unnerving. They wouldn't stop until they uncovered the truth.\nAnd if that truth led back to us...\nI shook the thought away, forcing myself to focus. I couldn't afford to let fear cloud my judgment. Not now.\n\"We stick to the plan,\" I said firmly. \"No more mistakes. No more slip-ups. We see this through, no matter what.\"\nJenny nodded reluctantly, but I could see the cracks forming in her resolve. I just hoped those cracks wouldn't bring everything crashing down around us.\nAlina's POV\nDean and I stood in Finn's room, the oppressive silence heavy with unspoken grief. The maids had cleaned up, but the lingering scent of antiseptic couldn't mask the memories of what had happened here.\n\"This is where it started,\" I said quietly, my eyes scanning the room. \"Whoever killed Finn was in this room, Dean. They stood right here and...\" My voice faltered, and I clenched my fists. \"They took him from me.\"\nDean placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder. \"We'll find them, Alina. And when we do, they'll pay.\"\nI nodded, my jaw set with determination. \"They think they've won. They think they've gotten away with it. But they haven't. We'll make sure of that.\"\nDean's eyes gleamed with fierce resolve. \"Together.\"\nAs we left the room, a sense of purpose settled over me. Finn's death wouldn't be in vain. I would uncover the truth, no matter what it took. And when I did, justice would be served.\n139\nAlina's POV\nThe dim glow of the moon seeped through my window, casting long, wavering shadows on the walls. The silence in the pack house was almost unnerving, a stark contrast to the turmoil in my mind. Finn's death haunted me relentlessly-his smile, his laugh, the way he always seemed to hold the pack together. Now he was gone, and we were left scrambling in the dark to uncover who had ripped him away from us.\nBut I wouldn't rest until I knew.\nA soft knock on my door startled me. My heart raced as I got up cautiously. No one should have been awake at this hour. Opening the door, I was met with a familiar face-Dean.\nI pulled him inside quickly, locking the door behind him. \"You shouldn't be here,\" I whispered sharply.\nDean leaned against the wall, his face etched with exhaustion but his eyes burning with determination. \"I couldn't stay hidden any longer, Alina. We're running out of time.\"\nI nodded, knowing he was right but unwilling to admit it aloud. Dean had been staying in one of the abandoned cabins on the outskirts of the territory, far from prying eyes. He was supposed to be safe there, invisible to the pack, but he'd risked exposure to come here tonight.\n\"What have you found?\" I asked, motioning for him to sit on the edge of my bed.\nHe lowered himself, running a hand through his hair. \"Not much, but enough to know that Bianca and Jenny are lying about something. They're always together, whispering, avoiding questions about that night.\"\nI frowned. \"Bianca's smart. She knows how to keep her tracks clean. If she's involved, she won't slip up easily.\"\nDean leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees. \"Then we push harder. We need to get inside her head and make her paranoid. The guilt will eat away at her if she's hiding something.\"\nA lump formed in my throat at the thought of manipulating someone like that, but Dean was right. This wasn't about playing nice; it was about finding the truth.\n\"And Jenny?\" I asked. \"Do you think she's capable of\"\n\"Murder?\" Dean finished for me, his expression grim. \"No. But she might know something. Bianca's the leader-Jenny just follows.\"\nI bit my lip, my mind churning. \"If we're going to confront them, we need solid evidence first. Otherwise, they'll just deny it, and we'll lose the element of surprise.\"\nDean nodded. \"Agreed. I'll keep digging. In the meantime, stay close to them. Watch their movements, listen to what they're not saying.\"\nI met his gaze, a surge of gratitude and determination swelling within me. \"Thank you, Dean. For being here.\"\nHe smiled faintly. \"For Finn, I'd do anything.\"\n\\---\nBianca's POV\nThe weight of the world seemed to press down on me as I wandered through the quiet halls of the pack house. Jenny was asleep-finally-after I'd spent hours convincing her that everything would be fine. But even as I spoke those words to her, I wasn't sure I believed them myself.\nI'd lied before, covered for mistakes, but this this was different. Finn's death wasn't something I could brush under the rug. Alina's eyes, sharp and accusing, were constantly on me, and Lia wasn't far behind. They could smell the fear, the guilt, no matter how hard I tried to hide it.\nReaching the kitchen, I poured myself a glass of water and leaned against the counter. My reflection in the window stared back at me, pale and drawn. I hated what I'd become-hated the lies, the deceit, the constant fear of being caught.\nA creak behind me snapped me out of my thoughts. I turned sharply, my heart racing, but the kitchen was empty.\n\"Get a grip,\" I muttered to myself.\nStill, I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching.\n\\---\nThe next morning, I forced myself to act normal, even as my insides churned. Alina was in the dining room, her usual spot at the head of the table. She didn't look at me directly, but I could feel her scrutiny.\n\"Morning,\" I said casually, taking my seat.\n\"Morning,\" she replied, her tone clipped.\nJenny joined a moment later, her movements stiff and awkward. I shot her a warning glance, silently willing her to pull it together.\n\"So,\" Alina began, her eyes flicking between us, \"have you two remembered anything useful about that night?\"\n\"No,\" I said quickly. \"We've already told you everything we know.\"\nJenny nodded, her voice barely above a whisper. \"It was chaos. I can't remember much.\"\nAlina hummed thoughtfully, her gaze lingering on me a moment too long. \"Funny how everyone else seems to recall where they were, what they were doing. But you two your stories are always vague.\"\nI clenched my fists under the table, forcing a calm smile. \"We've been through this, Alina. We didn't see anything suspicious.\"\n\"Hmm,\" she said again, leaning back in her chair. \"Well, let me know if you suddenly remember anything.\"\nThe tension was unbearable, and I excused myself as soon as I could. Jenny followed, her face pale.\n\"She knows,\" Jenny whispered as we stepped outside. \"Bianca, she knows.\"\n\"She doesn't,\" I snapped, more harshly than I intended. \"She's fishing for a reaction. Don't give her one.\"\nJenny nodded, but her fear was palpable. I needed to keep her calm, or she'd unravel everything.\n\\---\nAlina's POV\nI watched Bianca and Jenny retreat, their fear as plain as day. Dean was right-they were hiding something. I just needed to figure out what.\nAfter breakfast, I made my way to the forest, where Dean was waiting in the shadows.\n\"They're cracking,\" I told him. \"Jenny's barely holding it together, and Bianca's doing everything she can to cover for her.\"\nDean nodded, his expression serious. \"Then we press harder. Let the pressure build until they can't take it anymore.\"\nI hesitated, a pang of guilt tugging at me. \"And what if we're wrong? What if they're just scared because they think we'll blame them for something they didn't do?\"\nDean's jaw tightened. \"Then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. But right now, they're our best lead.\"\nI nodded reluctantly. \"What's our next move?\"\nDean's eyes gleamed with determination. \"We follow them. Tonight, after everyone's asleep. If they're up to something, we'll catch them in the act.\"\n\\---\nBianca's POV\nThat night, I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Every creak of the floorboards and every rustle of the wind set my nerves on edge.\nJenny had fallen asleep early, but I couldn't rest. Something about Alina's questions this morning had rattled me more than I wanted to admit.\nUnable to sit still, I slipped out of my room and headed for the woods. The darkness was oppressive, but the cool air helped clear my head.\nI didn't notice the figure trailing me until it was too late.\n\"Out for a midnight stroll?\"\nI spun around, my heart pounding. Alina stood a few feet away, her arms crossed, her expression unreadable.\n\"I couldn't sleep,\" I said quickly. \"What are you doing out here?\"\n\"Same,\" she said, stepping closer. \"Funny how we keep running into each other.\"\nHer gaze was piercing, and I felt like she could see right through me.\n\"What do you want, Alina?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\"The truth,\" she said bluntly. \"About that night. About Finn.\"\nI forced a laugh, even as my stomach churned. \"I already told you-\"\n\"Stop lying, Bianca,\" she snapped, her voice low but dangerous. \"I know you're hiding something, and I won't stop until I find out what it is.\"\nMy breath caught, but I managed to keep my composure. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\nShe stepped even closer, her eyes blazing. \"You can deny it all you want, but the truth always comes out. And when it does, I hope you're ready for the consequences.\"\nI held her gaze, refusing to back down, but inside, I was crumbling. If Alina kept digging, it was only a matter of time before she uncovered everything.\nAnd when she did, there'd be no turning back.\n140",

        "content": "Lia's POV\nThe evening air was thick with tension as I made my way to meet Luca. My heart raced, both from the fear of what had happened earlier and the anticipation of finally sharing everything with someone who might be able to help. Finn's death, the accusations, the chaos-it all weighed heavily on me, and I needed clarity, answers, and protection.\nThe narrow path I took was shrouded in darkness, with the faint sound of rustling leaves accompanying my footsteps. A sense of unease crept over me, like eyes were watching me from the shadows. I stopped in my tracks and glanced around, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\n\"Get a grip, Lia,\" I whispered to myself, resuming my walk.\nThe unease didn't leave, though. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and the cool night air seemed to grow colder. Suddenly, a hand clamped over my mouth, stifling my scream as another arm wrapped tightly around my waist, dragging me into the nearby thicket.\n\"Shh, don't make a sound,\" a voice hissed in my ear.\nMy heart pounded wildly as I struggled against my captor, but his grip was ironclad. He pushed me against a tree, his face coming into view under the dim moonlight. It was Dean. My breath hitched in shock.\n\"Dean?\" I managed to whisper, my voice trembling.\nA sinister smirk spread across his face as he held a gun to my head. \"Miss me, Lia? You should have known better than to wander around alone.\"\n\"Let me go!\" I spat, trying to push him away. \"What do you want?\"\n\"What I've always wanted,\" he growled, his tone dripping with malice. \"You. But first, let's deal with something else.\" His smirk faded, replaced by cold fury. \"Do you know how tempting it was to finish you off along with Finn? But no, that would've been too easy. I wanted you to see what happens when you cross me.\"\nThe realization hit me like a freight train. \"You killed Finn,\" I accused, my voice shaking with both fear and anger.\nDean laughed, the sound chilling in its cruelty. \"Oh, don't sound so surprised. Finn was always in the way, but now? Now it's just you and me.\"\nI swallowed hard, forcing myself to stay calm despite the panic threatening to consume me. My eyes darted to the gun in his hand. I had to act fast.\nWith a surge of adrenaline, I twisted my body and slammed my elbow into his side. He grunted in pain, loosening his grip just enough for me to wrestle the gun from his hand. The cold metal felt foreign in my grasp, and my hands shook as I pointed it at him.\n\"Stay back!\" I warned, my voice unsteady.\nDean chuckled darkly, his confidence unshaken. \"You don't even know how to use that thing.\"\nBefore I could respond, he lunged at me. My finger slipped, and the gun fell from my grasp. Dean snatched it up quickly, his smirk returning as he held it up triumphantly.\n\"Well, that was cute,\" he sneered, stepping closer. \"But playtime's over.\"\nI braced myself for the worst, but instead of pulling the trigger, he backed away. \"You're not worth the bullet... yet. But don't think this is over, Lia. Not by a long shot.\"\nWith that, he disappeared into the darkness, leaving me shaken and breathless.\nIt took me a moment to gather myself, my legs trembling as I stumbled out of the thicket. I had to get to Luca. He was the only one who could help now.\nWhen I finally reached Luca's place, I was a disheveled mess, tears streaming down my face as I banged on his door. He opened it quickly, his expression shifting from confusion to alarm when he saw me.\n\"Lia, what happened?\" he asked, ushering me inside.\n\"It's Dean,\" I said, my voice breaking. \"He followed me, abducted me, and-he confessed. He's the one who killed Finn.\"\nLuca's jaw tightened, his hands balling into fists. \"Are you sure?\"\nI nodded. \"He even had a gun. He threatened me... I barely escaped.\"\nLuca placed a comforting hand on my shoulder. \"Listen to me, Lia. You need to go back home and act like nothing happened.\"\n\"What?\" I exclaimed, disbelief and frustration bubbling to the surface. \"I can't just pretend-\"\n\"Lia,\" he interrupted, his tone firm. \"This is bigger than you or me. If Dean's responsible for Finn's death, I need to handle this carefully. If he knows you're onto him, it could get worse.\"\nI bit my lip, torn between my fear and my trust in Luca. \"But what if he comes after me again?\"\n\"I won't let that happen,\" he assured me. \"Just trust me, okay? Go home, stay safe, and leave the rest to me.\"\nReluctantly, I nodded. \"Okay. But please, Luca... don't let him get away with this.\"\n\"I won't,\" he promised, his voice like steel.\n\\---\nLuca's POV\nAfter Lia left, I sat in my office, my mind racing. Dean. The name left a bitter taste in my mouth. I had hoped never to deal with him again, but now he was at the center of a storm that threatened to tear everything apart.\nI picked up my phone and dialed his number, masking my anger with a carefully controlled tone. He answered on the second ring.\n\"Dean,\" I said, keeping my voice neutral. \"It's been a while.\"\nThere was a pause on the other end before he responded. \"Luca. To what do I owe the pleasure?\"\n\"I heard you were back in town,\" I said smoothly. \"Thought we should catch up.\"\nDean chuckled, the sound grating on my nerves. \"Is that so? Or are you calling about something else?\"\nI clenched my jaw, forcing myself to remain calm. \"Just wanted to make sure everything's going smoothly on your end. You know, no loose ends.\"\n\"Smooth as ever,\" he replied, his tone smug. \"But you already knew that, didn't you?\"\nI leaned back in my chair, my grip tightening on the phone. \"Good. Because I'd hate for any... complications to arise.\"\nDean laughed, a low, menacing sound. \"Don't worry, Luca. I know how to handle complications.\"\nThe line went dead, and I placed the phone down, my mind racing with plans and contingencies. Dean was playing a dangerous game, and I couldn't afford to let him win. Lia's safety-and the truth about Finn's death-depended on it.\nFor now, I needed to act like I didn't know anything, to keep Dean from suspecting my involvement. But behind the s\nscenes, I would unravel his schemes piece by piece until there was nowhere left for him to hide.\n141\nAlina's POV\nThe house was silent as I made my way to the hidden room I had secretly arranged for Dean. I had to be cautious; no one could know he was here, especially now. Tomorrow was Finn's funeral, and the emotions in the house were already running high.\nWhen I finally reached the door, I hesitated. Taking a deep breath, I knocked softly. Dean opened the door, his sharp features illuminated by the dim light inside. His expression was unreadable, but there was a fire in his eyes-calculated and dangerous.\n\"We need to talk,\" I said, stepping into the room.\nDean shut the door behind me and leaned against the wall, crossing his arms. \"About what?\"\n\"Finn,\" I said firmly. \"We need to come up with a plan to find out who killed him. Tomorrow's the funeral, and people are starting to ask questions. We can't keep sitting in silence.\"\nDean smirked, his eyes gleaming with something that made my stomach turn. \"Oh, I already have a plan.\"\nI blinked, taken aback. \"You do?\"\nHe walked over to the small table in the corner and picked up an object. It took me a moment to realize it was a gun. My breath caught in my throat.\n\"This,\" he said, holding it up for me to see, \"is the gun that killed Finn.\"\nShock coursed through me. \"How-where did you find that?\"\nDean's smirk widened. \"I've been... doing some digging of my own.\"\nMy head spun as questions flooded my mind. \"Who does it belong to?\"\nDean took a step closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Lia... and her lover, Luca.\"\nMy eyes widened. \"What? No. That's impossible!\"\n\"Oh, it's very possible,\" he said, his tone dripping with mockery. \"I've got proof.\"\nHe reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone. On the screen was a text message. I leaned in to read it, my heart pounding.\nLia: Come to my bedroom tonight. We need to talk.\nThe words blurred before my eyes as disbelief washed over me. \"She knows you're here?\" I asked, my voice trembling.\nDean shrugged nonchalantly. \"We've been in touch. She reached out to me the moment she found out I was back.\"\nMy head snapped up. \"Why didn't you tell me this earlier?\"\n\"I didn't think it mattered,\" he said with a smirk. \"But now, it seems like it does.\"\nI clenched my fists, anger bubbling to the surface. \"So, what's your plan? Confront her? Expose her?\"\n\"Not yet,\" Dean replied, his tone calm. \"Let her play her little games. I'll make my move when the time is right.\"\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing. Lia had been hiding so much from all of us, and now she was involved in Finn's murder? It didn't add up, but I couldn't ignore the evidence.\n\"Fine,\" I said, my voice hard. \"I'll be waiting to see how this unfolds.\"\nDean's smirk returned, and he pocketed his phone. \"You won't be disappointed.\"\nLia's POV\nThe night was unusually still, the kind of silence that made every creak of the house sound like a thunderclap. I lay in bed, the weight of the day pressing down on me. Tomorrow was Finn's funeral, and I couldn't shake the unease that had settled in my chest.\nI must have dozed off because the next thing I knew, I heard the faint creak of my bedroom door. My eyes fluttered open, and for a moment, I thought I was dreaming. A dark figure loomed near the foot of my bed.\n\"Who's there?\" I mumbled, my voice groggy.\nBefore I could fully sit up, the figure pounced on me, pinning me down. A strong hand clamped over my mouth as the other tried to force my face toward theirs. I struggled against the weight, panic surging through me.\n\"Stop it!\" I muffled against the hand, thrashing wildly.\nSuddenly, the room was flooded with light. I froze as I heard a shrill scream. Alina stood by the door, her face twisted in rage.\n\"Dean!\" she shouted. \"What the hell are you doing?\"\nDean scrambled off me, but the damage was done. I sat up, disheveled and confused, as Alina stormed into the room. She didn't stop at Dean. Her furious gaze locked onto me.\n\"What is going on here?\" I demanded, my voice shaking.\n\"You little slut!\" Alina hissed, marching toward me. Before I could react, her hand connected with my cheek in a sharp slap that left my skin stinging. \"You dare bring a man into this house, under this roof, after your husband was murdered?\"\n\"What are you talking about?\" I stammered, still reeling from the slap. \"I didn't bring anyone here!\"\n\"Oh, really?\" Alina sneered. \"Then why was he in your room? And what's this?\"\nShe yanked open one of the drawers of my bedside table. My heart stopped as she pulled out a gun-the same gun Dean had shown her earlier.\n\"That's not mine!\" I cried, standing up. \"I've never seen that before!\"\nBy now, Bianca, Jenny, and several of the house staff had gathered outside the room, drawn by the commotion. Their shocked whispers filled the air as Alina brandished the gun like a trophy.\n\"Don't even try to deny it,\" she spat. \"You've been sneaking around with Dean, plotting God knows what while pretending to mourn Finn.\"\n\"That's not true!\" I shouted, my voice cracking with desperation. \"I don't even know why Dean is here!\"\nDean, who had been silent until now, stepped forward with a smirk. \"Oh, come on, Lia. Don't act like you didn't invite me. I have the texts to prove it.\"\nMy blood ran cold. \"What texts? I never-\"\nBefore I could finish, Alina cut me off. \"Save it for the police,\" she snapped. \"They're on their way, and you're going to rot in jail for what you've done.\"\nPanic clawed at my throat as I looked around the room, searching for someone-anyone-who might believe me. But all I saw were faces filled with suspicion and judgment.\nDean's smirk widened, and Alina stood triumphant, the gun still clutched in her hand. The walls of the room seemed to close in around me as the weight of the accusations pressed down on my chest.\nI was trapped. And for the first time, I wasn't sure if I could find a way out.\n142\nLia's POV \nThe cold metal cuffs dug into my wrists as the officers led me out of the house. I kept my head down, unable to meet the eyes of the house staff who peered through windows and doorways, their expressions ranging from shock to satisfaction. The last thing I saw before stepping out into the night was Alina's smug grin, half-hidden in the shadows of the hallway.\nMy mind raced as the car bumped along the dark road toward the police station. The reality of the situation was setting in, twisting my stomach into knots. Finn, my husband of just a few days, was dead, and I was the prime suspect. The betrayal I felt wasn't just from the accusations; it was from knowing who had orchestrated this. Alina and Dean. They had been behind this from the start, pulling strings in the dark while I blindly played into their hands.\nWe arrived at the station, and I was ushered into an interrogation room with walls so gray and lifeless they seemed to suck the air out of my lungs. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unforgiving glare. A police officer with a stern face sat down across from me, flipping through a thick file.\n\"Mrs. Cross,\" he said, his voice void of any emotion. \"Tell me again what happened the night Finn died.\"\n\"I've told you everything I know,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. \"I was in my room when I heard the shot. By the time I got there, it was too late. Finn was already-\" My throat closed up, but I forced myself to continue. \"He was already gone.\"\nThe officer leaned back, crossing his arms as he scrutinized me. \"You were married for what, a week? And now your husband is dead. That's quite the coincidence, wouldn't you say?\"\nI clenched my jaw. \"What are you implying? That I married him just to kill him?\"\n\"You tell me, Mrs. Cross. We've seen strange things. And right now, you're the only suspect we have. No one else had a motive or opportunity like you did.\"\nI shook my head, my vision blurring with tears I refused to shed. \"I didn't kill him. He was my husband. He-\"\n\"Your husband of barely a week,\" the officer interrupted coldly. \"This isn't the love story you're making it out to be.\"\nA silence fell over the room, thick and suffocating. I knew arguing wouldn't help. They were convinced I was guilty. But this wasn't just an interrogation; it was the first step in a well-planned setup. Dean and Alina had thought of everything, leaving me trapped with no way out.\nAs the hours dragged on, I answered their questions over and over, each word feeling more futile than the last. With every passing second, my hope dimmed. The only glimmer of light was the thought of Luca and Benedicta. They had to know what was happening. They had to find me and prove my innocence before it was too late.\nBianca's POV\nI sat in the kitchen, fingers drumming nervously on the table as Jenny made tea. The silence in the house felt strange, almost peaceful without Lia's presence, but it also felt hollow. After all the weeks of suspicion and tension, the weight had shifted. And now, Lia was the one under the spotlight.\n\"Can you believe it?\" Jenny said as she sat across from me, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Lia. Of all people.\"\n\"I can,\" I replied, keeping my voice calm despite the flutter of nerves in my chest. \"She's been acting strange for weeks. Sneaking around with that man, Dean. Who knows what else she's been hiding.\"\nJenny leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper. \"Do you really think she did it? Killed Finn?\"\nI stared at the steam rising from my cup, letting the question linger in the air. It was a question I hadn't dared to answer, even in my own mind. \"I don't know,\" I said finally. \"But if she didn't, she's doing a terrible job of proving her innocence.\"\nJenny nodded, her face a mix of relief and guilt. \"At least we're not the ones being questioned anymore. For weeks, I felt like every eye in this house was watching us, waiting for one of us to slip.\"\nI opened my mouth to agree when raised voices from the hallway caught our attention. We exchanged a glance and got up, moving toward the noise. Peering around the corner, we saw Alina standing close to a man I didn't recognize. He was tall, with sharp eyes and an air of danger that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.\n\"Who is that?\" Jenny whispered, clutching my arm.\nI shook my head, watching as Alina spoke in low, hurried tones to the man. There was something about their interaction-an urgency that hinted at secrets far deeper than we had imagined.\n\"We need to find out who he is,\" Jenny said, a determined edge in her voice. \"If we know who he is and why he's here, maybe we can understand what's really happening. And maybe we can make sure Lia never steps foot in this house again.\"\nI nodded, my heart thudding with a mix of fear and anticipation. Lia might have been taken away, but it was clear that her influence lingered. If this man was involved, then he was a piece of the puzzle that could unravel everything.\nAs we stepped back into the kitchen, I couldn't shake the feeling that the storm was far from over. Lia's absence had given us a reprieve, but it hadn't ended the game. And in this house, secrets had a way of rising to the surface, no matter how deeply they were buried.\nJenny and I exchanged a silent agreement: we had to be vigilant. If we wanted to keep our place secure, if we wanted to ensure Lia didn't return to reclaim her spot and tear us down, we needed to be ready for whatever came next.\nThe tension in the house was palpable, and the silence that followed was more telling than any words spoken. This wasn't over. Not by a long shot.\n143\nLuca's POV\nI arrived at Benedicta's house as fast as I could, my heart pounding. Her frantic call hadn't given me much information, but the panic in her voice was enough to send alarms ringing in my head. When I walked in, she was pacing the room, her face pale and her hands trembling.\n\"Benedicta, what's wrong?\" I asked.\nShe stopped and turned to me, her eyes filled with worry. \"It's Lia. I think something's happened to her. I could feel it, Luca. She's in trouble.\"\nHer words unsettled me, but I tried to stay calm. \"What do you mean you feel it? Have you tried calling her?\"\n\"I've called her multiple times, but she's not picking up,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"Luca, I'm scared.\"\nI immediately pulled out my phone and dialed Lia's number. It rang, but there was no answer. I tried again and again, but it went straight to voicemail. The unease in my chest grew heavier.\nJust then, my phone buzzed with an incoming call. I quickly answered, hoping it was Lia, but it was Jenny.\n\"Jenny,\" I said urgently, \"where's Lia? Is she okay?\"\nThere was a brief pause before Jenny replied coldly, \"She's been arrested.\"\n\"What? Arrested? What are you talking about?\" My voice rose in disbelief.\n\"They think she killed Finn,\" Jenny said bluntly. \"The police came and took her.\"\n\"That's impossible! Lia would never-\" I started, but she cut me off.\n\"I don't know, Luca. All I know is that she's in custody now. The evidence points to her,\" Jenny said, her voice devoid of emotion.\n\"Which police station?\" I demanded, but Jenny hung up before answering. I stared at my phone in frustration and disbelief.\n\"What happened?\" Benedicta asked, her voice trembling.\n\"They've arrested Lia. They're accusing her of killing Finn,\" I said, my voice thick with anger.\nBenedicta gasped, her hands flying to her mouth. \"No that's not true. That's not true!\"\n\"I know it's not true, but they've taken her,\" I said, running a hand through my hair. \"I need to find out where she is.\"\nAs I turned to leave, my phone buzzed again. This time, it was an unknown number. I hesitated before answering.\n\"Hello?\"\n\"It's Dean,\" a deep voice said on the other end.\nMy grip on the phone tightened. \"What do you want?\"\n\"We need to talk,\" Dean said calmly. \"Meet me at the old warehouse on Fifth Street. You know the place.\"\nI hesitated. \"Why should I trust you?\"\n\"You don't have a choice if you want to help Lia,\" Dean replied before hanging up.\nI looked at Benedicta. \"I have to go. I'll let you know as soon as I find out what's going on.\"\n\\---\nThe warehouse was dimly lit, the smell of rust and decay filling the air. Dean was already there, leaning casually against a pillar as if he didn't have a care in the world. His calm demeanor only fueled my anger.\n\"You better have a good reason for dragging me here,\" I snapped as I approached him.\nDean smirked. \"Relax, Luca. I've got answers. You'll want to hear this.\"\n\"I'm not in the mood for games, Dean. Tell me what you know about Lia,\" I demanded.\nDean straightened up, his expression turning serious. \"Fine. Here it is. I killed Finn.\"\nThe words hit me like a punch to the gut. I stared at him, my mind reeling. \"What did you just say?\"\n\"I killed Finn,\" he repeated, his tone cold and matter-of-fact.\n\"You're lying,\" I said, my voice shaking with fury.\nDean's smirk returned. \"Why would I lie about something like that?\"\nBefore I could stop myself, I swung at him, my fist connecting with his jaw. He stumbled back but quickly recovered, wiping a hand across his mouth.\n\"Feel better?\" he asked, his tone mocking.\n\"You bastard!\" I snarled. \"Why would you kill him? Why would you frame Lia?\"\nDean's expression darkened. \"I didn't frame Lia. I saved her.\"\n\"Saved her?\" I spat. \"You ruined her life!\"\n\"No, I saved it,\" he said firmly. \"Alina wanted Lia dead. She had everything planned out. I stopped her by taking Finn out first.\"\nI froze, his words sinking in. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\"Alina saw Lia as a threat,\" Dean explained. \"She was going to have her killed. I intervened. Finn was collateral damage.\"\nI shook my head, trying to make sense of it all. \"And you think that makes it okay?\"\nDean shrugged. \"It's not about what's okay. It's about what's necessary. If I hadn't stepped in, Lia would be dead right now.\"\nI clenched my fists, torn between anger and confusion. \"Why are you telling me this?\"\n\"Because we need to deal with Alina,\" Dean said simply. \"She's the real problem here. Get rid of her, and Lia's name can be cleared.\"\n\"You're insane,\" I said, shaking my head. \"This is your mess. You clean it up.\"\nDean stepped closer, his expression serious. \"You care about Lia, don't you? Then do what needs to be done. Alina won't stop until Lia's out of the picture-for good.\"\nI stared at him, my mind racing. If what he said was true, Alina was more dangerous than I'd realized. But trusting Dean felt like making a deal with the devil.\n\"Why should I trust you?\" I asked.\n\"Because I'm the only one who can help you,\" Dean said. \"Think about it, Luca. You don't have much time.\"\nHe walked away, leaving me alone with my thoughts. I stood there for a long time, the weight of his words pressing down on me.\n\\---\nDean's POV\nI could feel Luca's anger long before I saw him. He was furious, but I didn't blame him. The truth I'd just revealed was a lot to take in. But he needed to know the reality of the situation.\nAlina was dangerous, and if we didn't deal with her, Lia wouldn't survive.\nAs I walked away from the warehouse, I pulled out my phone and dialed Alina's number.\n\"It's done,\" I said when she answered.\n\"Good,\" she replied coldly. \"Lia is\nout of the picture, and everything is falling into place.\"\nFor now, I thought to myself. But this wasn't over.\nNot yet.\n144\nLuca's POV\nThe drive to the police station felt longer than it should have. My hands gripped the steering wheel tightly, frustration bubbling under the surface. Lia didn't belong behind bars, and I was determined to get her out. When I arrived, I approached the front desk with a steady resolve.\n\"I'm here to see Lia,\" I said to the officer seated behind the desk.\nThe officer barely glanced at me before shaking his head. \"No visitors allowed.\"\n\"What do you mean, 'no visitors allowed'? She's my wife-\" I started, but he cut me off.\n\"She's under investigation, and Alina has put in a directive barring all visitors until further notice.\"\nAlina. Her name felt like a curse. Her influence over everything was suffocating. I clenched my fists, anger simmering just beneath the surface.\n\"This is ridiculous. You can't just deny me access-\"\n\"It's not up to me,\" the officer interrupted, his tone flat and dismissive. \"Rules are rules.\"\nI left the station, my blood boiling. The audacity of Alina to meddle like this only fueled my determination. Lia needed me, and I wouldn't sit back while Alina pulled all the strings.\nBack in my car, I slammed my fist against the steering wheel. If Lia couldn't defend herself, I would have to do it for her. I decided to visit my lawyer\nWhen I arrived at my lawyer's office, the receptionist informed me he was available. I didn't wait for an invitation; I pushed open the door and walked in.\n\"Luca,\" he greeted, his brow furrowing at the sight of my obvious distress. \"What's going on?\"\nI wasted no time diving into the issue. \"It's about Lia. She's been accused of killing Finn, but she's innocent. Dean-he confessed to me that he killed Finn and framed Lia. He claims he did it to protect her, but I know there's more to the story.\"\nThe lawyer leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. \"That's a serious accusation, Luca. Do you have any proof?\"\n\"Not yet,\" I admitted, \"but that's why I'm here. Dean said there was a gun with Lia's fingerprints on it, the one used to kill Finn. We need to find that gun. And we need to find the gun with Dean's fingerprints. That's our only chance of clearing Lia's name.\"\nHe nodded thoughtfully. \"If we can locate both weapons, we can start building a case against Dean. But this won't be easy. If Alina is as influential as you say, she'll do everything she can to keep the truth buried.\"\n\"I don't care how hard it is,\" I said firmly. \"I'll do whatever it takes.\"\nThe lawyer scribbled some notes on a pad. \"We'll need a private investigator to start digging into this. In the meantime, I'll begin drafting a motion to challenge the evidence against Lia. We'll argue that the investigation was influenced by Alina's personal vendetta.\"\n\"Thank you,\" I said, standing up. \"I'll find those guns.\"\nAs I left his office, a sense of purpose settled over me. It wasn't much, but it was a start.\nWhen I returned to Benedicta's house, the weight of the day pressed heavily on my shoulders. I found her in the living room, knitting quietly. She looked up when I walked in, concern etched on her face.\n\"What happened?\" she asked.\n\"Alina's barred anyone from visiting Lia,\" I said, sinking into a chair. \"She's pulling all the strings, and the police are eating out of her hand.\"\nBenedicta frowned. \"That woman is dangerous. We need to be careful.\"\n\"I know,\" I said, running a hand through my hair. \"I just don't know what to do next. The lawyer's working on a strategy, but it's going to take time. And time is the one thing we don't have.\"\nBefore Benedicta could respond, Merlin came bounding into the room, his face lighting up when he saw me.\n\"Uncle Luca!\" he exclaimed, rushing over to hug me.\nI forced a smile, hugging him back. \"Hey, buddy. What's up?\"\n\"I miss Mama,\" he said, his big eyes looking up at me. \"When is she coming back?\"\nI swallowed hard, struggling to find the right words. \"Soon, Merlin. I promise.\"\n\"Can we go to the park tomorrow?\" he asked, his tone hopeful.\nBefore I could answer, Benedicta chimed in. \"Luca will take you to the park, won't you, Luca?\"\nI blinked, taken aback. Merlin grinned and ran off, excited. Once he was out of earshot, I turned to Benedicta.\n\"Why did you say that?\" I asked, my voice low.\nShe leaned closer, her expression serious. \"Because I think Dean might come after Merlin. He's Lia's son, and that makes him a target. Taking him to the park is the perfect way to keep an eye on him-and maybe even gather evidence against Dean.\"\nI stared at her, her words sinking in. \"You think Dean would stoop that low?\"\n\"Dean is dangerous, Luca. We can't take any chances,\" she said firmly.\nI nodded slowly. \"Alright. I'll take Merlin to the park tomorrow. But we need to be prepared for anything.\"\nAs I headed to my room that night, my mind raced with everything that had happened. Lia's arrest, Dean's confession, Alina's interference-it all felt like an elaborate game, and I was determined to beat them at it.\nFor Lia. For Merlin. For the truth.\n____\nAlina's POV\nThe grand hall was buzzing with tension as I stepped inside, the weight of the elders' eyes pressing heavily on me. They sat in a semi-circle, their expressions a mix of sternness and disapproval. I clenched my fists at my sides, forcing myself to remain composed. They didn't understand. None of them did.\n\"Alina,\" Elder Marcus began, his voice deep and measured, \"we've convened this meeting to address the matter of Lia's detainment. This is a werewolf affair, not a human one. The pack elders should handle this investigation, not the human authorities.\"\nI narrowed my eyes. \"With all due respect, Elder Marcus, this is my decision. Finn was my brother. I have every right to handle this the way I see fit.\"\nElder Helena, always the voice of calm but firm reasoning, leaned forward. \"We understand your grief, Alina. Finn's death is a tragedy, but that does not give you the authority to make unilateral decisions for the pack. Lia is part of this pack, and as such, her fate should be decided by us.\"\n\"Her fate is already decided!\" I snapped, my voice echoing through the hall. \"She killed Finn. The evidence is clear. What more is there to discuss?\"\nElder Marcus shook his head. \"The evidence is circumstantial at best. A gun with her fingerprints does not confirm guilt. We need a thorough investigation conducted by our own.\"\nI scoffed, barely able to contain my frustration. \"And what will your investigation achieve? Wasting time while the culprit walks free? Lia is already in custody. Let the humans handle it.\"\nThe elders exchanged glances, their disapproval palpable. Elder Helena spoke again, her tone firm. \"You are letting your personal feelings cloud your judgment, Alina. This is bigger than you or your grief. The pack's stability is at stake. If the members see that we cannot even handle our own affairs, they will lose faith in us.\"\n\"Without the council,\" Elder Marcus added, \"the pack would descend into chaos. You know this, Alina. We are the bedrock of this clan.\"\nTheir words stung, but I refused to back down. \"And what about my pain? What about my loss? Finn was my brother! Do any of you even know how that feels? To lose someone you love so suddenly and so violently?!\" My voice cracked, but I didn't care. Let them see my anger, my grief.\nElder Marcus sighed, his gaze softening. \"We do not wish to diminish your pain, Alina. But emotions cannot dictate justice. We have decided-\"\n\"You've decided?!\" I cut in, my voice rising. \"What have you decided now?!\"\nElder Marcus didn't flinch. \"We are sending a team to retrieve Lia. She will be brought back to the pack and held as a prisoner until the investigation is complete. Her guilt or innocence will be determined by us, not humans.\"\nMy chest tightened, rage boiling within me. \"You can't do that!\"\n\"We can,\" Elder Helena said calmly. \"And we will. This is not just about Finn. It's about the pack. The longer this drags on, the more unstable things become. We must act swiftly and decisively.\"\nI slammed my hands on the table, leaning forward. \"So you don't believe she's guilty? Is that what you're saying? After everything, you're still doubting me?\"\nElder Marcus frowned. \"This isn't about belief, Alina. It's about due process. If Lia is guilty, we will find out. But until then, she is innocent in the eyes of the pack.\"\nTheir words felt like a slap to the face. I straightened, my hands trembling with barely suppressed fury. \"You're making a mistake,\" I hissed.\nElder Helena's gaze was steady. \"The mistake would be allowing emotions to rule over logic and justice. This meeting is adjourned. The retrieval team will be dispatched by dawn.\"\nI didn't wait for further discussion. I turned on my heel and stormed out of the hall, my heels clicking loudly against the marble floor.\nOnce outside, I leaned against a pillar, breathing heavily. How could they do this? After everything I had done for the pack, after everything I had sacrificed, they still doubted me. Lia was guilty. She had to be. There was no other explanation.\nBut now they were undermining me, questioning my judgment, treating me like some grieving fool incapable of making decisions.\nA sharp pang of betrayal coursed through me. Finn had been more than just my brother; he had been my anchor, my confidant. His loss had left a gaping hole in my heart, one that I was desperate to fill with justice-or vengeance, if necessary.\nThe elders didn't understand. They couldn't.\nBut they would see. Once Lia was exposed as the murderer she was, they would all see that I was right. And when that day came, I would make sure they regretted doubting me.\n145\nDean's POV\nI lingered just outside the grand hall, my ears perked and tuned to every word exchanged inside. Alina's voice was sharp, cutting through the air like a blade. Her anger was palpable, her defiance strong against the elders' authority. As I listened to their futile attempts to calm her, I smirked to myself. Alina's rage was a weapon, one I intended to wield.\nWhen she stormed out of the hall, I waited until she was far enough down the corridor before following her, careful to keep my steps silent. Her pace was hurried, her movements frantic, and I could feel the tension radiating off her like heat from a flame.\n\"Alina,\" I called, stepping out from the shadows.\nShe spun around, her eyes wild and bloodshot. \"Dean,\" she hissed. \"What do you want?\"\nI stepped closer, lowering my voice. \"I heard everything. The elders are against you, and I know how much that stings.\"\nShe crossed her arms tightly over her chest, her lips pressed into a thin line. \"They're fools. Lia killed Finn. I know she did. But now they're sending a team to drag her back here as if she's some innocent lamb. It's infuriating.\"\nI nodded, feigning sympathy. \"I can see how much this has hurt you, Alina. But you're not alone. I'll stand by you. Just tell me-what do you want to do?\"\nHer eyes narrowed, glinting with a dangerous light. \"I want her to suffer. I want her to feel what Finn felt. And when she's broken and begging for mercy, then maybe I'll feel fine.\"\n\"Good,\" I said with a slow smile. \"That's a clear goal. Revenge. It's simpler than justice and far more satisfying.\"\nHer brow furrowed as she looked at me, and for a moment, I thought she'd question my intentions. Instead, she said, \"Do you have a plan?\"\nI stepped closer, lowering my voice even more. \"The moonlight party is coming up. You know about the auction, don't you?\"\nShe tilted her head, curiosity flickering across her face. \"What about it?\"\n\"Every year, women in masks are auctioned off to the highest bidder, and the werewolf who wins gets to take the most beautiful one home. It's tradition. This year, I'll make sure Lia is one of those women.\"\nHer lips curled into a cruel smile. \"Go on.\"\nI continued, my voice filled with a sinister edge. \"I'll rig the auction. I'll make sure she ends up with someone ruthless, a werewolf who has no mercy. Once the auction is over, I'll strike a deal with him. He'll make sure Lia is gone-forever. Within two days, she'll be nothing but a memory.\"\nAlina's smile widened, her eyes gleaming with approval. \"And how do you plan to pull this off?\"\n\"It's simple,\" I said. \"We'll need the elders' approval to bring Lia back first. They'll think you've given in to their demands, but in reality, you're just setting the stage for her downfall. Once she's back, I'll handle the rest. You'll just need to sit back and watch.\"\nShe laughed, a sound filled with bitterness and satisfaction. \"Dean, you're a genius. This is exactly what I need.\"\nI nodded, pleased with her response. \"Good. But I'll need your full support. This plan requires precision, and I can't do it alone.\"\n\"You have my support,\" she said without hesitation. \"Do whatever you need to do.\"\nI leaned closer, my voice a low whisper. \"Trust me, Alina. Lia won't live to see another moon.\"\nShe placed a hand on my shoulder, her grip firm. \"Make it happen. Whatever it takes.\"\nWith that, she turned on her heel and strode down the corridor, her anger now tempered by purpose. I watched her go, a sense of satisfaction settling over me.\nNow, all the pieces were in place. Lia's fate was sealed. The only thing left to do was wait. But first, I had another task to attend to-a loose end that needed tying up before the moonlight party.\nThe moon hung low in the sky as I made my way through the woods, the shadows thick and oppressive. My destination was a secluded cabin hidden deep within the forest, a place where deals were made, and secrets were buried.\nInside, a lone figure awaited me-a hulking werewolf with scars etched across his face. He rose as I entered, his golden eyes gleaming with curiosity.\n\"Dean,\" he said, his voice a gravelly growl. \"What brings you here?\"\nI didn't bother with pleasantries. \"I have a proposition for you.\"\nHe raised an eyebrow, intrigued. \"Go on.\"\n\"There's a woman. She'll be at the moonlight auction. I want you to win the bid for her. Name your price, and I'll make it worth your while.\"\nHis eyes narrowed. \"What's the catch?\"\n\"The catch is that she doesn't leave your side alive,\" I said bluntly. \"Two days, that's all I need. After that, you can do whatever you want with her.\"\nHe let out a low chuckle, his teeth glinting in the dim light. \"You always were a ruthless one, Dean. Fine. Consider it done.\"\nI smiled, satisfied. \"Good. I'll be in touch with the details. For now, just prepare yourself. This needs to go off without a hitch.\"\nHe nodded, and I turned to leave, the weight of the night pressing against my back.\nAs I made my way back to the pack grounds, I couldn't help but feel a surge of anticipation. Lia's days were numbered, and soon, Alina would have her revenge.\nThe moonlight party would be her undoing-and my greatest triumph.\n____\nLuca's POV \nThe warm sun bathed the park in golden light, casting long shadows as children ran and played. Merlin's laughter was infectious, his little legs sprinting to the swings as he waved at me to follow. I couldn't help but smile, even as the weight of my thoughts pressed heavily on my chest. This wasn't just a father-son outing; it was a calculated move, one I had to carefully execute knowing that Dean's eyes were likely on me.\nI settled on a bench near the swings, my gaze scanning the park's perimeter. Every rustling bush, every idle figure loitering in the distance, made my instincts flare. I knew Dean wouldn't sit still. He'd either be here, watching or have someone else doing it for him.\nMerlin's giggles pulled my attention back. \"Dad! Look at me! I'm flying!\" he shouted, pumping his legs to go higher on the swing.\n\"You're doing great, champ!\" I called back, forcing a grin.\nMy phone vibrated in my pocket, and I knew before looking who it would be. Sliding it out, the name Dean flashed across the screen. My jaw clenched as I answered.\n\"What do you want?\" I asked curtly, keeping my voice low but steady.\n\"Relax, Luca,\" Dean's voice came through, smug and self-assured. \"I just thought we should talk. Man to man.\"\nI leaned back, my eyes narrowing. \"Talk? About what exactly?\"\nDean chuckled softly, the sound grating. \"You know what this is about. Meet me, and I'll explain everything.\"\nI glanced at Merlin, his small figure illuminated in the sunlight, his innocence a stark contrast to the shadows Dean cast over our lives. My patience snapped.\n\"I know you're watching me, Dean,\" I said, keeping my tone sharp. \"You think you're clever, following me around, trying to corner me. But let me make one thing clear-you'll never outmaneuver me. I'm already a step ahead of whatever you're planning. So, if you want to play games, watch your back. Because the next time you call me, I won't just be polite.\"\nThere was a pause on the other end, and then a soft chuckle. \"Touchy, aren't we? Fine, Luca. Have it your way. But remember-you're not the only one playing this game.\"\nI ended the call before he could say more, shoving my phone back into my pocket. My heart was racing, but I forced myself to stay calm for Merlin's sake.\n\"Dad!\" Merlin called again, jumping off the swing and running toward me. \"Can we go get ice cream?\"\nI smiled and ruffled his hair. \"Sure, buddy. Let's go.\"\nThe ride home was quiet. Merlin happily munched on his ice cream in the back seat, oblivious to the storm brewing around him. My mind raced with possibilities. Dean's call confirmed what I'd already suspected-he was watching us, waiting for the right moment to strike.\nWhen we arrived home, Benedicta greeted us at the door, her face lighting up at the sight of Merlin. \"Did you have fun at the park?\" she asked, crouching to hug him.\n\"Yes!\" Merlin exclaimed. \"Dad bought me ice cream too!\"\nBenedicta smiled and looked up at me. \"Thank you, Luca. It means a lot to him.\"\nI nodded, my expression serious. \"Can we talk?\"\nShe stood, immediately sensing the tension. \"Of course. Merlin, go wash up, okay?\"\nMerlin ran off, leaving us alone in the living room. I sat down, rubbing a hand over my face.\n\"Dean called me,\" I said without preamble.\nHer eyes widened. \"What did he say?\"\n\"He wants to meet,\" I replied. \"But it's not just that. He's been watching us, Benedicta. Following me. Probably keeping tabs on Merlin too.\"\nShe gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. \"What does he want?\"\nI shook my head. \"I don't know yet. But he's playing a dangerous game, and I'm not going to let him win. I told him I was ahead of him, but the truth is, we need to be careful. He's unpredictable.\"\nHer brows furrowed, worry etched into her features. \"Do you think he'd hurt Merlin?\"\nI hesitated, the thought sending a chill down my spine. \"I don't know. But I won't take any chances. For now, I want you to keep an eye on Merlin at all times. Don't let him out of your sight, even for a second.\"\nShe nodded, her resolve firm. \"What about you? What are you going to do?\"\n\"I'm going to figure out Dean's next move,\" I said. \"And I'll make sure he pays for everything he's done.\"\nBenedicta placed a hand on my shoulder. \"Be careful, Luca. We can't lose you too.\"\nI nodded, determination burning in my chest. Dean had underestimated me, but that would be his downfall. He thought he could play with my family, but he was about to learn just how wrong he was.\n146\nLia's POV\nThe sound of the keys jingling outside my cell sent a chill down my spine. I sat up, staring at the bars, dreading yet another interruption to my solitude. My life was in shambles, but at least here, in this cold, damp cell, I could think-strategize.\n\"Get up,\" the warden's gruff voice commanded as she unlocked the door.\nI stayed seated, narrowing my eyes. \"What now?\"\n\"You have visitors,\" she snapped, stepping inside.\nVisitors. My stomach churned. No one should be here. No one who cared about me would dare come to this place. Which left only enemies.\nI stood slowly, letting my chains rattle as I stretched out my aching limbs. \"This should be fun,\" I muttered under my breath, following her out.\nThe warden led me through the long corridor. Every step felt heavier than the last, the chains clinking like a somber melody. As we stepped outside, the blinding sunlight stung my eyes. I blinked rapidly, trying to adjust, and then I saw them.\nAlina and Dean.\nAlina stood tall and regal, her arms crossed, her expression dripping with smug satisfaction. Dean, on the other hand, leaned casually against a post, his face devoid of emotion, but his sharp eyes never left mine.\nI let out a short, bitter laugh. \"Well, well,\" I said, tilting my head. \"Dean, is this your new plaything? Or are you just following her orders like a good little pet?\"\nAlina's face twisted in fury, and before I could react, her hand flew across my face, the sharp sting spreading through my cheek. The warden didn't even flinch; she just stood there, indifferent, as though this was a daily occurrence.\n\"You vile, conniving wench!\" Alina spat, her voice low and venomous. \"You think this is a joke? You will pay for what you've done! The elders will see to that.\"\nI took a step back, tasting blood on my lip but refusing to wipe it away. \"Punished for what, Alina? For existing? Or for standing in the way of your desperate need for control?\" I smirked, though my heart raced in my chest. \"Tell me, dear sister-in-law, have you ever stopped to ask yourself who's really behind all this?\"\n\"Shut your mouth!\" she barked, her hands trembling with rage.\nI turned my attention to Dean, ignoring her outburst. \"And you, Dean? What's your angle here? Or are you just here for the entertainment?\"\nDean stepped forward, his presence imposing despite his calm demeanor. \"We've got evidence, Lia,\" he said coolly, his tone sharp as a blade. \"Evidence of your affair with Luca. Even when you were engaged to Finn, you were sneaking around like the ungrateful little liar you are.\"\nMy smirk faltered, but I quickly recovered. \"Oh, please,\" I scoffed, my voice laced with defiance. \"What kind of evidence? Fabricated texts? Staged photographs? You two are grasping at straws, and it's pathetic.\"\nDean leaned closer, his dark eyes boring into mine. \"The elders won't see it that way. You'll be tried, and when the truth comes out, you'll wish you'd never crossed us.\"\nI held his gaze, refusing to show fear. \"You're both cowards,\" I said, my voice steady. \"And when the real truth comes out, it'll be you two standing in chains, not me.\"\nAlina's laugh was cold and hollow. \"Keep dreaming, Lia. But remember this: tomorrow, the elders will strip you of whatever dignity you think you have left. You'll rot in the pack's prison, and no one will mourn you.\"\nI turned to the warden, ignoring Alina's venomous words. \"I don't want any more visitors,\" I said firmly. \"Not from them, not from anyone. Make it clear-they're not welcome here.\"\nThe warden nodded, her face betraying no emotion as she led me back inside.\nAs I walked away, I could feel their eyes burning into my back, their hatred palpable. But I refused to look back. I wouldn't give them the satisfaction.\nBack in my cell, I sat down heavily on the cot, my mind racing. They thought they had won, but I wasn't finished. Not by a long shot.\n___\nAlina's POV\nI paced the length of my room, my heels clicking against the polished wooden floor, my thoughts racing as I waited for Dean to arrive. Everything was falling into place, but there was still one loose thread that needed to be tied up-Lia.\nA sharp knock on the door snapped me out of my thoughts. \"Come in,\" I said curtly.\nDean stepped inside, his face unreadable, as always. He moved with a quiet confidence that unnerved most people, but I found it useful. It was one of the reasons I had kept him close all these years.\n\"You called?\" he said, shutting the door behind him and leaning casually against the wall.\n\"Yes,\" I replied, folding my arms. \"We need to discuss Lia. The elders are already meddling, demanding her return to the pack for questioning. If we don't act soon, this whole thing could spiral out of control.\"\nDean smirked, his dark eyes glinting with amusement. \"You sound worried, Alina. That's not like you.\"\nI shot him a glare. \"Don't test me, Dean. I've come too far to let some meddling elders ruin my plans. Lia needs to be brought back to the pack-on our terms. We can't let her fall into their hands. They'll start asking questions, digging into things best left buried.\"\nDean nodded thoughtfully, straightening up. \"So, what's the plan? I assume you've already thought of a way to get her out of that cell?\"\n\"Of course,\" I said, a small, satisfied smile tugging at my lips. \"But it won't be easy. The prison is heavily guarded, and the warden is no fool. We'll need to be careful, precise.\"\nDean crossed his arms, leaning slightly forward. \"I'm listening.\"\nI began to pace again, outlining my plan as I spoke. \"First, we'll create a diversion. Something that will draw the guards' attention away from Lia's cell. A fire, perhaps, in one of the storage rooms. It doesn't have to be big-just enough to cause chaos.\"\nDean's lips curved into a sly grin. \"I like it. Chaos is always a good distraction.\"\n\"While the guards are occupied,\" I continued, \"you'll enter the cellblock disguised as one of them. I've already arranged for a uniform to be delivered to you. Once you're inside, you'll escort Lia out under the pretense of transferring her to another facility.\"\nDean raised an eyebrow. \"And you think she'll cooperate?\"\n\"She won't have a choice,\" I said coolly. \"I'll make it clear to her that this is her only chance to escape the elders' wrath. She may be stubborn, but she's not stupid.\"\n\"And once we get her back to the pack?\"\nI paused, meeting his gaze. \"We'll keep her under lock and key, out of sight. The elders can't question her if they don't know where she is. And once the Moonlight Auction begins, we'll put the final phase of our plan into motion.\"\nDean chuckled darkly. \"You really are ruthless, Alina. No wonder Finn trusted you to handle things.\"\nAt the mention of Finn, a flicker of pain shot through me, but I quickly pushed it aside. This wasn't the time for sentimentality.\n\"This isn't just about me, Dean,\" I said sharply. \"It's about the pack. Finn's death has left us vulnerable, and Lia is a threat to our stability. She has to be dealt with.\"\nDean nodded, his expression turning serious. \"Understood. When do we move?\"\n\"Tomorrow night,\" I replied. \"I'll handle the arrangements for the diversion. You focus on getting that uniform and making sure everything on your end goes smoothly.\"\nDean gave a mock salute. \"Consider it done. Anything else?\"\nI hesitated for a moment, then added, \"Be careful, Dean. If anything goes wrong, it could be both our heads on the chopping block.\"\nHe smirked again, his confidence unwavering. \"Don't worry about me, Alina. I know how to handle myself.\"\nAs he turned to leave, I called after him. \"And Dean?\"\nHe paused, looking back at me.\n\"Make sure Lia understands that this is her only chance. If she so much as thinks about betraying us, she won't live to regret it.\"\nDean's grin widened. \"You're more ruthless than I thought, Alina. I like it.\"\nWith that, he left, leaving me alone with my thoughts. I took a deep breath, steeling\nmyself for what lay ahead. Lia's days were numbered, and I would make sure she paid for everything she'd done.\n147\nBianca's POV\nThe night was still, save for the occasional rustle of leaves in the wind. I had been walking down the hall toward my room when I heard faint voices coming from Alina's study. Curious, I paused just outside the door, careful to stay in the shadows.\n\"Are you sure about this?\" Alina's sharp voice carried through the crack in the door.\n\"Yes,\" Dean replied confidently. \"Tomorrow night, everything will go as planned. Once the fire distracts the guards, I'll get Lia out and bring her back to the pack. She'll be ours to deal with.\"\nMy heart skipped a beat. Fire? Lia? What were they planning?\n\"And you're certain the elders won't interfere?\" Alina asked her voice tight with concern.\n\"They'll have no idea until it's too late,\" Dean assured her. \"By the time they figure it out, Lia will be back here, under our control. Trust me, Alina, everything is under control.\"\nI pressed my hand over my mouth to keep from gasping. Dean and Alina were plotting to break Lia out of prison. But why? And what did this mean about Finn's death? Could they have been involved?\nI didn't dare stay any longer. As quietly as I could, I slipped away from the door and hurried down the hall to find Jenny.\nWhen I reached her room, I burst in without knocking. Jenny sat on her bed, startled by my sudden entrance.\n\"Bianca, what's wrong?\" she asked, setting down the book she had been reading.\n\"You're not going to believe what I just overheard,\" I said, quickly closing the door behind me.\nHer brow furrowed. \"What are you talking about?\"\nI took a deep breath and recounted everything I had just heard. By the time I finished, Jenny's face was a mix of shock and determination.\n\"So, they're planning to break Lia out,\" she said slowly, piecing it together. \"But why? And why go to such lengths if they're convinced she's guilty?\"\n\"That's what I'm trying to figure out,\" I replied. \"It doesn't make sense. Unless\"\nJenny's eyes widened. \"Unless Dean and Alina are the ones behind Finn's death. Think about it-who else would have the means and motive to frame Lia?\"\nIt was a terrifying thought, but it made sense. Dean had always been shady, and Alina's hatred for Lia was no secret.\n\"We need to find out for sure,\" Jenny said, her voice steady. \"If they're going to the prison tomorrow night, we'll follow them. Maybe we can find proof of what they've done.\"\nI hesitated. \"It's risky, Jenny. If they catch us-\"\n\"We won't let them catch us,\" she cut me off. \"This might be our only chance to expose them.\"\nHer determination was contagious, and I found myself nodding. \"Alright. We'll follow them. But we need to be careful.\"\n\\---\nThe following night, Jenny and I waited in the shadows outside the pack house, our breaths shallow and our nerves on edge. We watched as Dean and Alina slipped out, their movements cautious but not cautious enough to spot us.\n\"They're heading toward the woods,\" Jenny whispered, nudging me.\nI nodded, and we followed at a safe distance, staying hidden among the trees. My heart pounded in my chest as we trailed them, every snap of a twig underfoot making me flinch.\nEventually, we reached the edge of the prison grounds. Dean and Alina stopped, crouching low as they surveyed the area.\n\"Stay here,\" Dean told Alina. \"I'll handle the guards.\"\nAlina nodded, her expression cold and resolute.\nJenny and I exchanged a glance. This was it. Whatever they were planning was about to happen.\nDean moved quickly, slipping into the shadows and disappearing from view. Alina remained where she was, her eyes fixed on the prison.\n\"We need to get closer,\" Jenny whispered, tugging my sleeve.\nWe crept forward, inching closer to where Alina was hiding. From our new vantage point, we could see Dean reemerge, now wearing a guard's uniform. He carried himself with confidence, moving as though he belonged there.\n\"He's going inside,\" I murmured.\nJenny nodded. \"They're definitely breaking her out. But why go through all this trouble if she's guilty? It doesn't add up.\"\nI shook my head, my mind racing. \"We need to find out what they're planning next. And if Dean really is responsible for Finn's death, we need to prove it.\"\nWe stayed hidden, watching as Dean entered the prison and Alina remained on the lookout. My stomach churned with a mix of fear and anticipation. Whatever was happening tonight was going to change everything.\n____\nLia's POV\nThe cell was cold and suffocating, but after days of sleepless nights and relentless worry, exhaustion finally overtook me. I fell into a restless slumber, haunted by dreams of Finn, Luca, and a sea of accusing faces.\nSuddenly, the shrill sound of the fire alarm jolted me awake. My heart raced as the piercing noise echoed off the cement walls, a chaotic symphony accompanied by the distant sound of shouting. Smoke began to seep through the small cracks around the door.\nI stumbled to my feet, coughing as the acrid smell filled my lungs. \"What's going on?\" I muttered, panic creeping into my voice.\nBefore I could piece together what was happening, I heard faint but deliberate footsteps outside my cell. My instincts screamed danger. \"Who's there?\" I called out, my voice trembling.\nNo response.\nThe footsteps grew louder, more purposeful until they stopped right outside my cell door. My pulse pounded in my ears as I backed up against the far wall.\nThe door creaked open, and through the haze of smoke, I saw a figure step inside. I couldn't make out their face at first, but their scent hit me-a distinct, familiar musk. My wolf stirred uneasily within me.\n\"Dean,\" I whispered, my voice laced with both anger and disbelief.\nHe didn't answer. Instead, he moved swiftly, covering his nose and mouth with a cloth as he approached me.\n\"What are you doing here?\" I demanded, my voice breaking. \"What is this?\"\nStill, he said nothing. His silence unnerved me more than any words could have. I pressed myself further into the wall, desperation coursing through my veins.\n\"Answer me!\" I shouted, but the words barely left my lips before Dean lunged at me.\nI ducked, narrowly avoiding his grasp, and scrambled toward the door. My hands clawed at the frame, but Dean was faster. His arm wrapped around my waist, yanking me backward with a force that knocked the air out of my lungs.\n\"Let me go!\" I screamed, thrashing against his grip.\nHe didn't let up. Instead, he brought the cloth he was holding toward my face. A sickly sweet smell invaded my senses as he tried to press it against my nose.\n\"No!\" I gasped, twisting my head away. My wolf surged within me, giving me strength as I clawed at his arms. I bit down hard on his wrist, and he let out a sharp grunt of pain, loosening his hold just enough for me to break free.\nI spun around to face him, my vision blurred by smoke and tears. \"Why, Dean? Why are you doing this?\"\nHe didn't answer, his expression a cold mask.\nAs I backed away, I sniffed the air, trying to confirm what I already knew. Beneath the stench of smoke and chemicals, his scent was undeniable. This was Dean. The man who had always lingered in the shadows, the man I had never trusted.\n\"You killed Finn, didn't you?\" I spat, the realization hitting me like a ton of bricks. \"This was all your plan, wasn't it?\"\nHis jaw tightened, and his silence spoke volumes.\nFury bubbled within me. \"You think you can frame me for your crime? Do you think this will make you untouchable?\"\nDean's eyes darkened, and without warning, he struck me across the face. Pain exploded in my cheek as I stumbled backward, dazed.\n\"Enough,\" he said finally, his voice low and menacing.\nBefore I could recover, he closed the distance between us, grabbing me by the arm. My vision blurred, and my strength began to wane as he pulled me toward the door.\nThe smoke grew thicker, each breath burning my lungs. My head spun as I tried to resist, but my body betrayed me.\n\"Luca will stop you,\" I managed to choke out, even as my knees buckled. \"You won't get away with this.\"\nDean let out a dark laugh. \"Oh, Lia, Luca isn't your savior. He's just another pawn in this game.\"\nHis words cut deeper than the blow to my face, but I couldn't focus on them. The world tilted, the edges of my vision darkening as he dragged me out of the cell.\nI tried to fight, to summon any strength I had left, but it was no use. The last thing I saw before e\nverything went black was the flickering glow of flames in the distance and Dean's cold, unrelenting face.\nDarkness swallowed me whole.\n148\nBianca's POV\nThe acrid smell of smoke hung heavy in the air as I crouched behind a charred wall, the flames casting flickering shadows around me. The chaos in the prison yard provided the perfect cover as I silently observed Dean emerging from the building, carrying an unconscious Lia over his shoulder.\nI couldn't deny the small flicker of satisfaction I felt as I discreetly raised my phone, recording every step he took. The camera lens followed his every move-the way he moved quickly yet cautiously, his sharp eyes scanning the area for anyone who might witness his actions.\n\"Perfect,\" I muttered under my breath. My phone's screen glowed faintly in the darkness, capturing every incriminating second.\nJenny was stationed elsewhere, tailing Alina. We had planned this carefully. Jenny would ensure Alina's actions were documented, while I focused on Dean. Every step of the way, we were one step closer to exposing the truth.\nAs I watched Dean haul Lia out of the crumbling building, I felt a pang of guilt twist in my chest. Lia's limp form reminded me of just how far this had gone. She didn't deserve this-not all of it, at least. My past actions weighed heavily on me now.\nFor weeks, I'd reveled in the idea of Lia's suffering. I'd convinced myself that she was the enemy, the woman who had ruined everything for everyone. But now, seeing her like this-broken, unconscious, and framed for something she clearly hadn't done-I couldn't ignore the gnawing sense of regret.\n\"Stay focused, Bianca,\" I whispered to myself. I couldn't afford to lose sight of the goal now.\nDean reached a black car parked just outside the gates. He opened the trunk and, without a second thought, dumped Lia's body inside like she was nothing more than a sack of grain.\nI bit my lip to stifle the gasp that threatened to escape. My hands shook slightly as I zoomed in on the screen, capturing the moment Lia's motionless form disappeared into the trunk.\nDean paused, his head snapping up as he scanned his surroundings again. I held my breath, my heart pounding in my chest. If he saw me now, I'd be done for.\nAfter a tense moment, he seemed satisfied that no one was around. He slammed the trunk shut and walked around to the driver's side. I stayed low, my body pressed tightly against the wall, as I recorded him getting into the car.\nThe engine roared to life, and the car sped off into the night, leaving a trail of dust and smoke in its wake. I exhaled slowly, relief washing over me as I realized he hadn't spotted me.\nI lowered my phone, my thoughts racing.\nThis wasn't just about helping Alina anymore. Watching Lia being treated like that-like a disposable pawn in their twisted game-had shifted something in me.\nI'd been so consumed by my loyalty to Alina and my own grievances against Lia that I'd ignored the bigger picture. Dean and Alina weren't just trying to punish Lia; they were orchestrating something far darker and more sinister. And I'd been complicit in it.\nI stood up slowly, brushing ash and soot off my clothes. I glanced at my phone screen, replaying the footage I'd just taken. Dean's actions were clear as day, undeniable evidence of his involvement in Lia's abduction.\nI couldn't confront them now-Dean and Alina were too dangerous, too powerful. But I could play along, pretending to remain on their side while secretly gathering more evidence.\nJenny would understand. She'd seen enough tonight to know where this was heading.\nPulling my hood over my head, I slipped away from my hiding spot, blending into the shadows. My mind raced as I made my way back to the rendezvous point where Jenny would be waiting.\nWhen I arrived, Jenny was already there, her face illuminated by the soft glow of her phone screen. She looked up as I approached, a knowing look in her eyes.\n\"Did you get it?\" she asked.\nI nodded, holding up my phone. \"Every second. Dean took Lia, put her in the trunk, and drove off. What about you?\"\nJenny's lips curled into a smirk. \"Got Alina acting all high and mighty, giving orders like she owns the world. She's practically incriminating herself.\"\n\"Good,\" I said, though my voice lacked the enthusiasm I usually had for our schemes.\nJenny noticed, her brow furrowing. \"What's wrong?\"\nI hesitated, unsure of how to put my feelings into words. \"I just I think we've been going about this the wrong way. Lia isn't the real enemy here.\"\nJenny blinked, surprised by my sudden change of heart. \"What are you saying?\"\n\"I'm saying we need to be careful,\" I said firmly. \"We'll keep pretending to side with Alina and Dean, but when the time comes, we strike. We'll expose them for what they've done-to Finn, to Lia, to everyone.\"\nJenny studied me for a moment before nodding. \"Alright. Let's do it.\"\nAs we walked away from the smoldering prison, I couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of purpose. Lia might not know it yet, but she had allies in this fight. And I was determined to make things right, no matter what it took.\n____\nAlina's POV\nThe air in the secret hideout was damp and cool, the dim light of a single bulb hanging overhead casting flickering shadows on the concrete walls. I tapped my fingers impatiently against the old wooden table, the rhythm steady yet filled with tension. My mind churned over every detail of the plan Dean and I had concocted. This was the final step. Everything had to go perfectly.\nA faint rumble broke through the silence, and my lips curled into a smile as Dean's car headlights pierced through the darkness outside. I stood, smoothing my jacket and bracing myself for his arrival.\nMoments later, the door creaked open, and Dean stepped inside, his movements sharp and confident. He carried the faint scent of smoke and sweat, likely from the chaos he'd orchestrated.\n\"It's done,\" he said, his voice low but tinged with satisfaction. \"Lia's in the trunk. Unconscious but alive.\"\n\"Good,\" I said, nodding in approval. \"You didn't run into any trouble?\"\nHe chuckled darkly. \"None worth mentioning. The fire created enough distraction to keep the wardens busy, and Bianca was nowhere to be seen. Everything went as planned.\"\n\"Excellent.\" I gestured to the chair opposite me, and he sat down, leaning back with a smug expression.\n\"So, what's next?\" he asked, folding his arms.\n\"We sneak her into the pack house tonight,\" I said, my voice firm. \"The cellar is the safest place to keep her. It's isolated, and no one will think to look there, especially if we spread the right rumors.\"\nDean raised an eyebrow. \"What rumors?\"\nI smirked. \"We'll tell the elders that Lia tried to escape. We'll say she started the fire to create a distraction and that the wardens quickly informed us of her plans. Naturally, being the dutiful pack leaders we are, we intervened and brought her back here before she could fully get away.\"\nDean's grin widened. \"And the elders will believe it. They've already labeled her guilty in their minds. This will only solidify their resolve to punish her.\"\n\"Exactly,\" I said, satisfaction swelling in my chest. \"The timing is perfect. By the time the elders hear of her so-called escape attempt, we'll already have her secured in the cellar. They'll trust us to keep her under lock and key until her trial.\"\nDean leaned forward, his elbows resting on the table. \"What about Bianca and Jenny? They've been poking around too much lately. Do you think they suspect anything?\"\nI frowned, the thought of those two irritating women souring my mood. \"Bianca is loyal to me-or at least, she's smart enough to pretend she is. As for Jenny, she's been a thorn in my side for years. But I don't think they have anything solid on us. Even if they're suspicious, they won't be able to act without proof.\"\nDean nodded, though a flicker of doubt crossed his face. \"We'll need to keep an eye on them, just in case. If they become a problem\"\n\"Then we'll deal with them,\" I finished coldly. \"Right now, our focus is on Lia. She's the key to everything. Once she's out of the way, we'll finally have control of the pack without anyone standing in our way.\"\nDean smirked, his confidence returning. \"You've always been good at this, Alina. Manipulating people, bending them to your will. It's impressive.\"\nI allowed myself a small smile. \"It's not manipulation, Dean. It's strategy. The pack needs strong leaders, and I'm the only one who can provide that. Lia was a threat to our stability and to our future. Removing her is a necessity, not a choice.\"\nDean raised his hands in mock surrender. \"Whatever you say, Alpha. Just tell me what you need me to do.\"\n\"For now, follow the plan,\" I said firmly. \"Get her to the cellar without anyone noticing. Once she's secure, we'll inform the elders of her 'escape attempt.' After that, we let the pack's justice system do the rest. Lia will be convicted, and her punishment will ensure she's no longer a problem-for good.\"\nDean stood, adjusting his jacket. \"Consider it done. Anything else?\"\n\"Just don't get careless,\" I warned, my tone sharp. \"One misstep and everything we've worked for could come crashing down.\"\nHe nodded, a flicker of seriousness crossing his face. \"Understood. I'll make sure everything goes smoothly.\"\nWith that, he turned and headed for the door. I followed him outside, the cool night air brushing against my skin as we stepped into the open.\nDean walked to his car and opened the trunk, glancing back at me with a grin. \"Still asleep,\" he said, motioning to Lia's unconscious form inside.\n\"Good,\" I said, my voice steady despite the surge of triumph I felt. \"Let's move.\"\nDean closed the trunk and got into his car, the engine rumbling to life. I climbed into my own vehicle, trailing behind him as we made our way back to the pack house.\nAs we drove through the dark, deserted roads, my mind raced with thoughts of what was to come. Lia's fate was sealed, and with her out of the way, nothing would stand between me and the power I deserved.\nI gripped the steering wheel tightly, a smile tugging at the corners of my lips.\nThis was only the beginning.\n149\nLia's POV\nI woke up to darkness and the damp, musty smell of earth. My head throbbed painfully, and as I shifted, I realized I was lying on a cold, hard floor. Disoriented, I tried to sit up, but my movements were slow and unsteady. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the faint light seeping through the cracks in the door, revealing the confined space around me.\nA cellar.\nPanic surged through me as I scrambled to my feet, my heart pounding in my chest. I rushed to the heavy wooden door, banging on it with all my strength. \"Hello? Is anyone there? Let me out!\"\nMy voice echoed in the small space, but there was no response. Frustration bubbled up inside me, and I pounded on the door again, my fists aching with the effort.\nSuddenly, I heard footsteps outside. I froze, holding my breath as the sound grew louder, stopping just on the other side of the door. The lock clicked, and the door creaked open, revealing Dean's tall, looming figure.\n\"Keep your voice down,\" he said sharply, stepping inside and closing the door behind him. His face was shadowed, but I could see the cold, calculating expression in his eyes.\n\"Why am I here?\" I demanded, my voice trembling with a mixture of fear and anger. \"Why did you take me from the prison?\"\nDean smirked, leaning casually against the wall. \"That's none of your business. Just know that you'll be brought before the pack elders soon enough. Your judgment is coming.\"\nI crossed my arms, glaring at him despite the terror clawing at my insides. \"Judgment? For what? For a crime I didn't commit? If anyone deserves to be judged, it's you, Dean.\"\nHe raised an eyebrow, amusement flickering across his face. \"Oh? And what exactly do you think I've done?\"\n\"I know you killed Finn,\" I said firmly, my voice steady despite the lump forming in my throat. \"I don't know how you did it, but I'm sure you're behind it. And trust me, the truth will come out. It always does.\"\nDean laughed, a low, mocking sound that sent chills down my spine. \"You really think anyone will believe you? You're nothing but a disgrace to the pack now. Nobody cares about your baseless accusations.\"\nI took a step forward, my hands clenched into fists. \"You can laugh all you want, but your time is running out. People are starting to notice. Bianca, Jenny-do you think they're just sitting around doing nothing? You won't get away with this, Dean.\"\nHis smirk faltered slightly, but he quickly masked it with a sneer. \"You're delusional, Lia. No one is coming to save you. You're alone in this, just like you've always been.\"\nBefore I could respond, his phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out, glancing at the screen before answering.\n\"Alina,\" he said, his tone instantly shifting to one of feigned warmth.\nMy heart raced as I heard her name. Alina. She was in on this. Of course, she was.\n\"Alina!\" I shouted, my voice ringing out in the confined space. \"Can you hear me? Do you even know who you're dealing with? What if Dean is the one who killed Finn?\"\nDean's eyes narrowed, and he stepped closer to me, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper as he spoke into the phone. \"I'll call you back.\"\nHe ended the call abruptly and turned his full attention to me, his face twisted with rage.\n\"Shut your mouth,\" he snarled, raising his hand.\nI braced myself, but the slap still caught me off guard, the force of it sending me stumbling backward. My cheek burned, and tears stung my eyes, but I refused to let him see me break.\n\"You don't know when to stop, do you?\" he hissed, his breath hot against my face. \"Maybe I should teach you a lesson right here and now.\"\nI glared at him, my voice steady despite the pain. \"Do whatever you want, Dean. You won't silence me. I'll keep fighting until the truth comes out, and when it does, you'll pay for everything you've done.\"\nHis jaw tightened, but he didn't respond. Instead, he stormed out of the cellar, slamming the door behind him. I heard the lock click, and then his footsteps faded away.\nAlone again, I sank to the floor, cradling my aching cheek. Fear and anger churned inside me, warring for dominance. Dean thought he had the upper hand, but I wasn't going to give up that easily.\nI had to find a way out of here. For Finn. For myself. And for the truth that needed to be exposed.\nAs I sat in the darkness, my resolve hardened. Dean and Alina might think they could manipulate everyone around them, but they underestimated me.\nThis wasn't over not by a long shot.\n____\nLuca's POV\nThe quiet hum of the coffee machine filled the kitchen as I leaned against the counter, waiting for the dark liquid to brew. The aroma filled the air, but it did little to calm the restless thoughts swirling in my mind. My fingers drummed on the countertop, and I sighed, glancing at the clock on the wall.\nIt was too quiet. Too still.\nJust as I reached for my mug, my phone buzzed on the counter. The name \"Benedicta\" flashed on the screen, and a wave of unease settled over me. I grabbed the phone and answered.\n\"Benedicta?\"\nHer voice came through, frantic and rushed. \"Luca, you need to get to the prison. It's on fire!\"\n\"What?\" I froze, the mug slipping from my fingers and shattering on the floor. \"What do you mean, the prison is on fire?\"\n\"I don't know all the details, but it's bad,\" she continued, her voice trembling. \"The fire broke out in the middle of the night, and I just heard from someone at the station. They're saying... they're saying Lia might have been inside.\"\nMy heart stopped. The words hit me like a punch to the gut, and for a moment, I couldn't breathe.\n\"Where are you now?\" I asked, already moving toward the door.\n\"I'm at home with Merlin,\" she replied. \"I wanted to go there, but I can't leave him alone.\"\n\"Stay there,\" I told her firmly. \"I'm going to the prison right now. I'll find out what's going on.\"\n\"Luca\" Her voice softened, laced with worry. \"Be careful.\"\nI hung up without responding, grabbing my keys and rushing out the door.\n\\---\nThe drive to the prison felt like an eternity. My mind raced with every possibility, every worst-case scenario. Was she alive? Had she escaped? Or\nNo. I couldn't think about that. She had to be alive.\nWhen I arrived, the scene was chaos. Flames still licked at the remains of the building, though firefighters were working tirelessly to put them out. Officers and emergency personnel swarmed the area, their faces grim.\nI parked the car haphazardly and ran toward the barricades. An officer stopped me, his hand on my chest.\n\"Sir, you can't go any further.\"\n\"I need to know what's happening,\" I said, my voice desperate. \"There's someone in there-a prisoner. Lia. Is she alive?\"\nThe officer's expression didn't change, and he shook his head. \"We're still gathering information. It's too early to say anything for certain.\"\nFrustration bubbled up inside me, and I took a step closer. \"Listen, I need answers. If you can't give them to me, then point me to someone who can.\"\n\"Calm down,\" he said sternly, glancing over his shoulder. \"I'll see if someone can speak with you.\"\nI waited, pacing back and forth as every second dragged on like an hour. Finally, another officer approached-a woman with a clipboard and an air of authority.\n\"You're here about the prisoner Lia?\" she asked, her tone brisk.\n\"Yes,\" I said immediately. \"What happened to her? Is she alive?\"\nShe glanced at her notes before meeting my gaze. \"The fire broke out in the west wing, where she was being held. When we searched her cell, there were no remains-no signs of a body. That leads us to believe she may have been abducted or escaped during the chaos.\"\n\"Abducted?\" My stomach twisted. \"Are you sure?\"\nShe nodded. \"There's evidence suggesting someone broke into the facility before the fire started. We're still piecing things together, but right now, our priority is finding her. We've issued a search order and alerted nearby authorities.\"\nI ran a hand through my hair, my mind spinning. \"Do you have any leads? Anything at all?\"\n\"Not yet,\" she admitted. \"But we'll find her. If she was taken, whoever did this won't get far.\"\nHer words did little to comfort me. I turned away, staring at the smoldering remains of the prison. Somewhere out there, Lia was either running for her life or being held against her will.\nThe thought made my chest ache.\n\\---\nI drove back to Benedicta's house in a daze, my hands gripping the steering wheel so tightly that my knuckles turned white. The image of Lia-scared, alone, in danger-played on repeat in my mind.\nWhen I arrived, Benedicta was waiting for me at the door. Her face was pale, and her hands trembled as she clutched Merlin close to her side.\n\"Well?\" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\nI shook my head. \"They don't know. Her cell was empty. They think someone took her.\"\nHer eyes widened in horror. \"What do you mean, took her?\"\n\"I don't know,\" I said, sinking onto the couch and burying my face in my hands. \"They're still investigating, but they're saying it wasn't the fire that got her out. Someone planned this.\"\n\"Who would do that?\" she asked, her voice trembling.\nI looked up, my jaw tightening. \"Dean.\"\nShe gasped, covering her mouth with her hand. \"You think he\"\n\"I don't think-I know,\" I said, my voice hard. \"It has his name written all over it. And I swear if he's hurt her\"\n\"Luca,\" Benedicta said softly, placing a hand on my shoulder. \"We'll find her. We'll bring her back.\"\nI nodded, though my mind was already racing ahead. Dean thought he could play games with Lia's life, but he underestimated me. I wasn't going to let him win.\nNot this time.\n150\nBianca's POV\nThe room was unusually quiet as I paced back and forth, my mind clouded with regret and unease. Jenny sat on the bed, her hands fiddling with her phone as if she were looking for the courage to speak. Finally, she sighed and broke the silence.\n\"Bianca, we've made some terrible mistakes,\" she said softly, her eyes meeting mine.\nI stopped pacing and turned to her, nodding slowly. \"I know. What we did to Lia... it wasn't right. I was so caught up in the moment, in everything Alina and Dean fed us, that I didn't stop to think for myself.\"\nJenny gave me a small, sad smile. \"Me too. But it's not too late. We can still do something to help her.\"\nHer words lit a spark of hope in me. \"You're right. But how? Dean and Alina have her locked up somewhere, and we both know they'll go to any length to make sure she suffers. If we make a wrong move, they'll know we're on to them.\"\nJenny bit her lip, thinking hard. Then she grabbed her phone and opened the video she'd recorded of Dean sneaking Lia out of the burning prison. \"We have this. It's proof of what they've done. If we can get it to the right person-someone who genuinely wants to help Lia-then maybe we can turn things around.\"\nI stared at the screen, the grainy footage showing Dean carrying an unconscious Lia to his car and driving off into the night. My chest tightened with guilt. \"Who can we trust, though? The elders? No, Dean and Alina have too much influence there. What about Luca?\"\nJenny's eyes widened. \"Yes, Luca! He cares about Lia. If anyone has the drive to bring her back safely, it's him. And he's powerful enough to take on Dean.\"\n\"Do you think he'll believe us?\" I asked, doubt creeping in.\nJenny nodded firmly. \"He'll believe the video. And once we tell him everything we know about what Alina and Dean have been plotting, he'll take action. He's Lia's best chance.\"\nI took a deep breath, the weight of our decision settling on my shoulders. \"Alright. You contact Luca. Set up a meeting with him for tomorrow. We'll give him the evidence and tell him everything.\"\nJenny wasted no time, pulling out her phone and dialing Luca's number. I watched her as the call connected, my heart pounding.\n\"Hello, Luca?\" Jenny said, her voice trembling slightly. \"It's Jenny. I need to talk to you about something important. Can we meet tomorrow?\"\nI couldn't hear Luca's response, but Jenny nodded and said, \"Okay, I'll text you the time and place. Please... don't tell anyone about this call.\" She ended the call and looked at me, relief washing over her face. \"It's done. He'll meet us tomorrow.\"\nI let out a breath I didn't realize I was holding. \"Good. Now we just have to make it through the night without anyone finding out what we're planning.\"\n\\---\nWe stepped out of Jenny's room, the hallway dimly lit and eerily silent. As we turned the corner, we almost bumped straight into Alina. My heart skipped a beat as her cold, calculating eyes met mine.\n\"Where are you two sneaking off to?\" she asked, her tone casual but laced with suspicion.\nI forced a smile, trying to act as nonchalant as possible. \"Just heading out for some air. It's been a long day.\"\nHer gaze lingered on us as if she were trying to read our minds. Jenny shifted uncomfortably beside me, but I placed a reassuring hand on her arm.\n\"Well, don't stay out too long,\" Alina said finally, her lips curving into a smirk. \"You never know what dangers lurk in the dark.\"\nThe way she said it sent a shiver down my spine, but I kept my composure. \"We'll be careful,\" I said, and without waiting for her to respond, Jenny and I walked past her.\nAs we moved further away, I glanced over my shoulder to make sure she wasn't following us. To my relief, she had turned in the opposite direction.\n\"Do you think she heard anything?\" Jenny whispered, her voice barely audible.\nI shook my head. \"No. If she had, she wouldn't have let us go so easily. But we need to be more careful. If she even suspects we're working against her, we're as good as dead.\"\nJenny nodded, her expression grim. \"Tomorrow can't come fast enough.\"\nThe weight of what we were about to do hung heavy between us as we stepped outside. The cool night air did little to calm my nerves, but I clung to the hope that we were finally doing the right thing.\nLia didn't deserve what was happening to her, and while I couldn't undo the harm I'd already caused, I could do this. I could help set things right.\nTomorrow, we'll meet Luca. And together, we'd take down Dean and Alina. It was the least I could do to make amends for the part I'd played in Lia's suffering.\nI just hoped we weren't too late.\n___\nAlina's POV\nThe moonlight spilled through the narrow corridor as I made my way to Dean's room. The faint hum of murmured voices from the pack house was a reminder that time was ticking, and the weight of our plans pressed heavily on my shoulders. I reached his door and knocked twice before pushing it open.\nDean was sitting on the edge of his bed, flipping through his phone. He looked up as I entered, a sharp smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.\n\"Alina,\" he said, setting his phone down. \"You're late.\"\nI ignored the remark and closed the door behind me. \"We have more pressing matters to discuss.\"\nHe raised an eyebrow but gestured for me to take the chair across from him. I sat, crossing my legs, and leaned forward slightly.\n\"The elders,\" I began, my voice low. \"Their meeting is scheduled for tomorrow. By now, people are definitely wondering where Lia is.\"\nDean leaned back against the wall, his arms crossed. \"Let them wonder. By the time they get their answers, it'll be too late for anyone to do anything.\"\nI frowned. \"That kind of overconfidence could cost us, Dean. We need to stay sharp, especially with Bianca and Jenny snooping around.\"\nDean's smirk faded, and his expression darkened. \"What makes you think they know something?\"\nI hesitated for a moment, piecing my thoughts together. \"It's just a feeling. They've been acting strange-whispering, avoiding me. Earlier, I nearly bumped into them, and the way they looked at me... it wasn't normal. It was as if they were hiding something.\"\nDean's eyes narrowed. \"If they know anything, they'll ruin everything we've worked for. They can't be allowed to interfere.\"\n\"That's exactly why I'm telling you,\" I said, my tone firm. \"You need to keep an eye on them while I handle the elders tomorrow. We need to ensure our story is airtight, that they believe Lia set the fire in a desperate attempt to escape.\"\nDean nodded, a glint of determination in his eyes. \"Don't worry about Bianca and Jenny. I'll take care of them. If they're planning anything, I'll find out.\"\nI leaned back in my chair, feeling slightly reassured but still uneasy. \"Good. Because the elders can't find out the truth. Not yet. If they do, all of this will be for nothing.\"\nDean got up and began pacing the room, his movements sharp and deliberate. \"Do you really think they'll believe Lia orchestrated her own escape?\"\n\"They'll have no choice,\" I said confidently. \"We'll present her as desperate, manipulative, and willing to burn the prison to the ground to avoid punishment. Besides, we've always had the elders wrapped around our fingers. They trust us.\"\nDean stopped pacing and turned to face me. \"And what about Bianca and Jenny? If they've seen or heard something, they could bring it all crashing down.\"\nI pressed my lips into a thin line. \"That's why I need you to handle them. Make sure they don't get the chance to speak out-or better yet, make them doubt themselves. Plant a seed of fear in their minds. If they think we're onto them, they might back off.\"\nDean nodded slowly, his expression thoughtful. \"I'll make it happen. But what about Lia? She's not going to stay quiet forever. The moment she opens her mouth, she'll try to implicate us.\"\n\"She won't have the chance,\" I said firmly. \"By the time the elders are done with her, she'll be too broken to fight back.\"\nDean's lips curled into a wicked grin. \"You're colder than I thought, Alina. I like it.\"\nI rolled my eyes. \"This isn't about being cold. It's about survival. Lia is a threat to everything we've built, and threats need to be eliminated.\"\nThe room fell into a tense silence as we both processed the gravity of our situation.\n\"Do you ever think about how we got here?\" Dean asked suddenly, his voice softer than usual.\nI looked at him, caught off guard by the question. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"How we went from being part of the pack to orchestrating something like this. Do you ever wonder if we've gone too far?\"\nI stiffened, unwilling to let doubt creep in. \"This is necessary, Dean. Everything we've done is for the greater good-for the pack. Lia would have destroyed everything if we didn't step in.\"\nDean's gaze lingered on me for a moment before he nodded. \"You're right. We can't let sentimentality cloud our judgment.\"\nI stood, brushing imaginary dust off my clothes. \"Exactly. Now, focus on Bianca and Jenny. I'll handle the elders and make sure our story holds.\"\nDean smirked again, his usual confidence returning. \"Consider it done.\"\nI turned to leave but paused at the door. \"And Dean?\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Don't underestimate them. Bianca and Jenny might seem like fools, but if they're desperate enough, they could cause real damage.\"\nHe nodded, his expression serious. \"I won't.\"\nSatisfied, I left the room, my mind already racing with the details of tomorrow's meeting. Everything had to go perfectly. One misstep and it wouldn't just be Lia who paid the price-it would be us too.\n151\nLuca's POV\nSitting on the worn leather couch in Benedicta's living room, I stared at my phone, replaying Jenny's words in my head. She had called earlier, her voice trembling as she insisted we meet. She claimed to have information about Lia, information that could turn everything around. My chest tightened at the thought of her name.\n\"I don't know if I can trust her,\" I admitted, running a hand through my hair.\nBenedicta leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, her expression filled with concern. \"What exactly did she say?\"\n\"She was vague, but she mentioned Lia and said it was urgent. She sounded scared.\"\nBenedicta tilted her head, a thoughtful frown on her face. \"Luca, you know this could be a trap. Dean has his claws in everything right now. Jenny could be working for him.\"\n\"I know,\" I said, my voice sharp with frustration. \"But what if she's telling the truth? What if she really knows where Lia is or what happened to her?\"\nBenedicta sat down across from me, her dark eyes steady. \"You need to tread carefully. Dean is dangerous, and if he suspects you're onto him, he won't hesitate to come after you-or Merlin.\"\nAt the mention of Merlin, a wave of protectiveness surged through me. \"I won't let anything happen to him. But I can't just sit here and do nothing while Lia's out there, probably suffering.\"\nBenedicta sighed. \"I understand, but think about it. Lia's been missing since that fire, and the only people who know the truth are the ones involved-Dean and Alina. If Jenny really has something to say, you need to verify it before acting on it.\"\nI nodded, knowing she was right. \"That's why I agreed to meet her tomorrow. In public. I'll make sure she can't pull anything.\"\nBenedicta tapped her fingers on the table. \"Do you think Dean is behind all of this? Finn's murder, framing Lia, everything?\"\nI leaned forward, elbows on my knees, and lowered my voice. \"I don't just think it-I'm sure of it. Dean killed Finn and made it look like Lia did it. He's manipulative, Benedicta. He's always been able to twist people and situations to his advantage.\"\nHer eyes narrowed. \"But why? What does he gain from all this?\"\n\"That's what we need to figure out. Dean doesn't do anything without a plan. He must be after something-power, control, revenge. Maybe all three.\"\n\"And what about Alina? She's just as involved.\"\n\"She's blinded by her hatred for Lia. Finn's death has given her the perfect excuse to destroy Lia's life, and she's using it to the fullest.\"\nBenedicta shook her head. \"It's sick. All of it. But Luca, if we're going to take them down, we need evidence. Not just hearsay.\"\n\"I know,\" I said, clenching my fists. \"That's why I'm meeting Jenny. If she has proof-anything that links Dean or Alina to Finn's murder-we can use it. But we also need to find out where Lia is. She's the key to all of this.\"\nBenedicta's gaze softened. \"You really care about her, don't you?\"\nI looked away, my throat tightening. \"Lia doesn't deserve any of this. She's been through hell, and now she's being blamed for something she didn't do. I have to help her. I have to make this right.\"\nFor a moment, silence hung between us, broken only by the soft ticking of the clock. Then Benedicta reached out and placed a hand on my arm.\n\"Be careful, Luca. Lia needs you, but Merlin needs you too. Don't let your anger cloud your judgment.\"\nI nodded, taking her words to heart. \"I won't. But I won't let Dean and Alina get away with this either. If Jenny has what I think she does, we're one step closer to exposing them.\"\nBenedicta gave a small smile, though her worry was still evident. \"Just promise me you'll come back in one piece.\"\n\"I promise,\" I said, though the weight of the situation made my chest feel heavy.\nAs I stood to leave, Benedicta called out, \"Luca?\"\nI turned back, and she hesitated before speaking. \"Do you think Lia knows? About Dean's involvement?\"\nI thought about it for a moment, picturing Lia's fiery determination even in the face of adversity. \"If she doesn't know yet, she'll figure it out. Lia's stronger than we give her credit for.\"\nBenedicta nodded, her expression unreadable.\nAs I walked out into the cool night air, I couldn't shake the feeling that time was running out. Dean and Alina were dangerous, yes, but the real danger lay in underestimating them. Lia's life-and the truth-depended on what happened next.\n___\nDean's POV\nThe chill of the early morning air bit into my skin as I stood in the parking lot, leaning casually against the hood of my car. The sun had barely risen, but I was already on edge. I knew Bianca and Jenny would show up sooner or later, and I intended to make sure I knew where they were going. Alina had her suspicions about them, and I wasn't about to let my guard down.\nThe sound of footsteps echoed across the lot, and I straightened up. Sure enough, Bianca and Jenny appeared, chatting quietly until they spotted me. Their expressions faltered for a split second before they quickly masked their surprise.\n\"Dean,\" Jenny greeted flatly, her hand tightening around her bag strap. \"What are you doing here so early?\"\nI crossed my arms, giving them both a hard look. \"Just following orders. Alina wants me to keep track of everyone's whereabouts. You know, with everything going on-Finn's murder, Lia's disappearance-it's important to stay vigilant.\"\nBianca snorted, clearly unimpressed. \"That's rich coming from you. Why don't you station yourself somewhere useful instead of bothering us?\"\nIgnoring her jab, I stepped forward. \"Where are you headed?\"\nJenny raised an eyebrow, her tone turning defensive. \"What's it to you? We're going to the mall. That's it. Now get out of the way.\"\nI didn't budge. \"You'll forgive me for not taking your word for it. Finn was killed, the killer is still out there, and now Lia's missing. Everyone's a suspect. Including you two.\"\nBianca let out a dry laugh, shaking her head. \"Oh, that's funny. You think we're suspects?\" She took a step closer, her eyes narrowing. \"You're more of a suspect than we'll ever be. Let's not forget who you are, Dean. You're Lia's ex, an outsider in this clan, and someone with more secrets than anyone else here. Maybe it's you we should be keeping an eye on.\"\nHer words hit harder than I cared to admit, and for a moment, I couldn't hide my shock. How did they know all that?\n\"Careful, Bianca,\" I said, my voice low. \"Throwing around accusations like that can be dangerous.\"\nJenny smirked, clearly enjoying the exchange. \"Is that a threat, Dean? Because if it is, let me remind you-you're not in charge here. You answer to Alina, just like everyone else.\"\nI clenched my jaw, my frustration mounting. They were toying with me, and it was working.\nBianca pushed past me, yanking open the car door. \"We don't have time for your paranoia. If you want to waste your day playing detective, be my guest. But leave us out of it.\"\nJenny followed suit, pausing only to flash me a mocking smile. \"Have fun spinning your conspiracy theories, Dean. Maybe you'll stumble onto something useful.\"\nBefore I could respond, they slammed the car doors shut, started the engine, and drove off, leaving me standing in the lot, fuming.\nI watched their car disappear around the corner, my mind racing. They knew too much-about me, about Alina's plans, about everything. And yet, they were acting like they had nothing to hide.\nSomething wasn't adding up.\nI pulled out my phone, dialing Alina's number as I walked back to my car.\nShe answered on the second ring. \"What is it?\"\n\"We have a problem,\" I said, sliding into the driver's seat. \"Bianca and Jenny are onto something. They know more than they're letting on, and they're not afraid to challenge me.\"\nAlina's voice was cold and calculating. \"What did they say?\"\n\"They brought up Finn's murder and Lia's disappearance,\" I explained. \"They even implied I'm the one who should be under suspicion. They're trying to rattle me.\"\n\"Let them,\" Alina said, her tone dismissive. \"They don't have anything concrete. Just keep an eye on them and report back if they slip up.\"\n\"Fine,\" I muttered, though her confidence did little to ease my irritation. \"But if they're digging into my past, they could become a real problem.\"\n\"Then make sure they don't find anything,\" Alina snapped. \"We can't afford any loose ends, Dean. Not now.\"\nHer words lingered in my mind long after the call ended.\nAs I sat there, staring out at the empty parking lot, I couldn't shake the feeling that the walls were closing in. Lia's disappearance, Finn's murder, Bianca and Jenny's sudden defiance-it was all spiraling out of control.\nBut if they thought they could outsmart me, they were sorely mistaken.\nThis wasn't over. Not by a long shot.\n152\nJenny's POV\nBianca and I exchanged a knowing glance as we drove down the main road, the morning sun casting long shadows over the car's dashboard. Dean's little stunt in the parking lot was laughable. The way he tried to play the enforcer, pretending to be the innocent one, was almost amusing if it weren't so infuriating.\n\"Can you believe him?\" Bianca scoffed, leaning back in her seat with crossed arms. \"Acting like we're suspects when we already know what he's capable of.\"\nI smirked, gripping the steering wheel tighter. \"He's so transparent, it's pathetic. But let him think he's in control. The more he underestimates us, the easier it'll be to take him down.\"\nBianca nodded, her expression hardening. \"He thinks we're clueless, but we've got him pegged. And Alina, too. They won't see us coming.\"\nBefore I could reply, my phone buzzed on the console. Luca's name flashed on the screen, and I quickly answered.\n\"Where are you?\" Luca's voice was tense and low like he was barely holding himself together. \"I'm waiting for you.\"\n\"I know,\" I said, keeping my tone calm. \"But we've got a problem. Dean's probably following us. I need to throw him off our trail first.\"\nThere was a pause on the other end before Luca spoke again, his voice heavy with concern. \"Be careful, Jenny. If he realizes you're onto him, he won't hesitate to retaliate.\"\n\"I know,\" I replied firmly. \"Just hold tight. I'll get to you as soon as I can.\"\nI hung up and turned to Bianca, who was already grinning. \"So, what's the plan?\"\nI glanced in the rearview mirror, spotting the black sedan trailing a few cars behind us. \"We're going to the mall. If Dean wants to play spy, let's give him something to watch.\"\nBianca chuckled. \"I love this. It's like a game of cat and mouse, and he doesn't even know he's losing.\"\nWe pulled into the mall parking lot, making a point to park in a spot that was visible from the road. As we stepped out of the car, I caught a glimpse of the black sedan slowing down before it turned into the lot.\n\"He's here,\" I whispered to Bianca, nodding discreetly toward the car.\nShe didn't even glance back, her confidence unshaken. \"Good. Let's give him a show.\"\nWe strolled into the mall, our pace leisurely, as if we had nothing better to do than shop. The air was filled with the chatter of shoppers and the faint scent of coffee wafting from a nearby café.\n\"We'll go into a few stores and pick up some things,\" I said quietly as we walked. \"Make it look convincing.\"\nBianca nodded, already scanning the storefronts. \"I could use a new pair of shoes anyway.\"\nWe ducked into a boutique, pretending to browse while keeping an eye on the glass doors. Sure enough, Dean's figure appeared moments later, lurking near the entrance like a wolf on the prowl.\nBianca smirked, picking up a pair of heels and holding them up. \"What do you think? Too much?\"\nI couldn't help but laugh softly. \"Perfect for distracting a would-be spy.\"\nWe continued shopping, moving from one store to the next, all the while aware of Dean's presence. He wasn't exactly subtle, but that worked to our advantage.\nAs we stepped into a larger department store, Bianca leaned close and whispered, \"He's still following us. Do you think he'll get bored?\"\n\"Not a chance,\" I replied. \"Dean's too paranoid to let us out of his sight. But that's fine. The longer he's stuck here, the less time he has to cause trouble elsewhere.\"\nBianca grabbed a scarf off a rack and held it up to her neck, posing dramatically. \"Do you think this screams 'innocent suspect' or 'mastermind in disguise'?\"\nI rolled my eyes, stifling a laugh. \"You're impossible.\"\nAs the hours ticked by, we made our way through the mall, loading up on bags to sell the illusion. Dean's shadow remained constant, a reminder of the dangerous game we were playing.\nBut despite the stakes, I couldn't help but feel a surge of satisfaction.\nFor once, we were in control. And if Dean thought he could outsmart us, he was in for a rude awakening.\nBianca nudged me as we headed toward the food court. \"Think we've distracted him enough?\"\n\"Almost,\" I said, glancing over my shoulder. Dean was leaning against a pillar, his eyes fixed on us.\n\"Let's grab something to eat,\" I added. \"Make him wait a little longer.\"\nBianca grinned. \"You're really enjoying this, aren't you?\"\nI shrugged, unable to hide my smirk. \"Let's just say it's nice to be the one pulling the strings for a change.\"\nAs we sat down with our food, I sent a quick text to Luca, letting him know the coast was clear-for now.\nDean might think he was the predator, but he was about to learn what it felt like to be the prey.\n___\nAlina's POV\nI gripped my phone tightly as I made my way down the dimly lit path toward the cellar. The air was damp, and the faint scent of mildew clung to the walls. Dean's voice crackled on the other end of the line.\n\"Any updates?\" I asked sharply, my patience wearing thin.\n\"She and that little friend of hers went to the mall,\" Dean replied. \"I've been tailing them for hours. I'm sure they're up to something.\"\nI sighed, rubbing my temple. \"Don't let them out of your sight. Whatever they're planning, I need to know before it blows up in our faces.\"\n\"Relax, Alina,\" Dean said, his tone oozing with confidence. \"I've got it under control.\"\n\"Don't make me regret trusting you,\" I snapped before hanging up.\nThe thought of Bianca and Jenny running loose, scheming behind my back, made my blood boil. They were loose threads, and I hated loose threads.\nThe heavy door to the cellar loomed ahead. I pushed it open, the creak of its hinges echoing in the empty corridor. Stepping inside, I spotted Lia slumped against the wall, her head resting on her knees. She looked so peaceful, almost fragile.\nI scoffed at the sight, my heels clicking loudly on the stone floor as I approached her. Without hesitation, I raised my foot and pressed it down on her leg. Hard.\nLia jolted awake with a gasp, her face contorting in pain. \"What the-\"\n\"Rise and shine,\" I said mockingly, taking a step back as she glared up at me.\n\"What do you want now, Alina?\" she spat, her voice laced with defiance.\nI crossed my arms, a smirk tugging at my lips. \"Oh, I just thought you'd like to know something interesting. Something about a certain little boy named Merlin.\"\nHer eyes widened, and for a brief moment, I saw a flicker of fear cross her face. She quickly masked it, but I had already seen enough.\n\"What about him?\" she demanded, her tone sharp.\nI crouched down, meeting her gaze with cold amusement. \"You see, I've been keeping tabs on him. He's safe... for now. With that lovely woman, Benedicta. But the thing is, I've got eyes everywhere.\"\n\"You stay away from my son,\" Lia hissed, her voice trembling with barely restrained fury.\nI chuckled, standing up and brushing imaginary dust off my pants. \"Or what? You'll stop me? Hate to break it to you, darling, but you're in no position to make threats.\"\nHer hands balled into fists, and she gritted her teeth. \"If you touch him, I swear you'll regret it.\"\n\"Regret it?\" I echoed, tilting my head. \"You're awfully bold for someone locked in a cellar, awaiting judgment. But don't worry, Lia. I don't need to hurt him-unless, of course, you give me a reason to.\"\nHer breathing quickened, and I could see the panic setting in. Good. That's exactly what I wanted.\n\"Now,\" I continued, straightening my posture, \"you'd better get yourself together. In three hours, you'll be standing before the pack elders. And trust me, they're not exactly known for their leniency.\"\nLia's defiant gaze met mine, but I could see the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes.\n\"You think you'll win, Alina?\" she said, her voice low and steady. \"You think you'll get away with everything you've done? The truth has a funny way of coming out. And when it does, you'll wish you never crossed me.\"\nI laughed, the sound echoing in the confined space. \"Oh, Lia. You're adorable when you're delusional. Enjoy your last few hours of false hope. You're going to need it.\"\nWith that, I turned on my heel and walked toward the door. Before stepping out, I glanced back over my shoulder, giving her one last smirk.\n\"Sweet dreams, Lia,\" I said, my tone dripping with mockery. \"You're going to need all the rest you can get.\"\nI shut the door behind me, the heavy sound of the lock clicking into place echoing through the corridor. As I walked back toward the main house, my phone buzzed in my pocket.\nIt was a message from Dean.\n\"They're leaving the mall. Headed back. Nothing suspicious so far.\"\nI rolled my eyes, typing back a quick response. \"Keep tailing them. I'll handle the elders. Just make sure those two don't screw this up for us.\"\nAs I slipped my phone back into my pocket, a small smile played on my lips. Everything was falling into place. Lia could fight and scream all she wanted, but the game was already won. All I needed to do now was play my part and let the pieces fall where they may.\n153\nLuca's POV\nThe weight of the past few days bore down on me like a suffocating blanket. I couldn't shake the gnawing worry about Lia. She was out there somewhere alive, I hoped but every passing second without answers felt like a dagger twisting in my chest.\nMy phone buzzed, pulling me from my thoughts. Jenny's voice came through the line, calm but urgent.\n\"We're here,\" she said.\nI grabbed my jacket and stepped out of my car, spotting Jenny and Bianca standing near the café's entrance. They looked anxious, their gazes darting around as if someone might overhear them.\n\"Let's make this quick,\" I said, gesturing for them to follow me to a quieter corner of the park nearby. \"What's this about?\"\nJenny glanced at Bianca before speaking. \"It's about Lia... and Dean.\"\nThe mention of his name made my fists clench. \"What about him?\"\nBianca took a deep breath, her expression conflicted. \"We know where Lia is being kept.\"\nMy heart skipped a beat. \"Where?\"\n\"At the pack house,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"In the cellar.\"\nI froze, trying to process the information. The pack house? That was Alina's territory, and it didn't take a genius to figure out she was involved in this mess.\n\"How do you know this?\" I asked, narrowing my eyes.\nJenny pulled out her phone, scrolling through her gallery before handing it to me. \"We've been following Dean and Alina for days, watching their every move. This is what we've found.\"\nThe screen displayed a video of Dean sneaking Lia unconscious out of the burning prison and loading her into a car. Another video showed Alina entering the cellar, her expression smug and satisfied.\n\"And that's not all,\" Jenny continued. \"We also know that Dean killed Finn.\"\nThe words hit me like a punch to the gut. \"What?\"\nBianca nodded. \"He's been framing Lia this whole time, making her look guilty to cover his tracks. Alina's helping him, probably because she has her own agenda. We don't know all the details yet, but it's clear they're working together to destroy her.\"\nAnger surged through me, my hands curling into fists. \"Finn was one of my closest friends. And now Lia is suffering because of their lies?\"\nJenny put a hand on my arm, her expression serious. \"That's why we're here, Luca. We need to work together to stop them. We can't let them win.\"\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm the storm raging inside me. \"What's the plan? How do we vindicate Lia and expose them?\"\nBianca spoke up, her voice firm. \"First, we need more evidence. The videos we have are good, but they're not enough to convince the elders. We need something concrete, something that links Dean directly to Finn's murder and Alina to the conspiracy.\"\n\"And Lia?\" I asked. \"We can't leave her in that cellar.\"\nJenny nodded. \"We'll get her out, but we have to be careful. If we move too soon, Dean and Alina will cover their tracks, and we'll lose our chance to expose them.\"\nI ran a hand through my hair, frustration boiling under my skin. \"So, what's the next step?\"\nJenny exchanged a glance with Bianca. \"We'll keep tailing them, gathering as much evidence as we can. You need to find a way to discreetly question the pack elders. See if any of them are already suspicious of Dean or Alina. If we can plant the idea that something's off, it'll be easier to present our case when the time comes.\"\n\"And what about Lia?\" I pressed. \"We can't leave her there indefinitely.\"\nBianca hesitated before speaking. \"We'll keep an eye on her, make sure she's safe until we're ready to act. The last thing we want is for Alina or Dean to panic and do something reckless.\"\nThe plan felt fragile, like it could crumble at any moment. But it was all we had.\n\"All right,\" I said finally. \"I'll do my part. But if anything happens to Lia-\"\n\"We won't let anything happen to her,\" Jenny interrupted, her tone resolute. \"We're in this together.\"\nI nodded, though the unease in my chest remained. \"Let's get to work.\"\nAs we left the park, my mind raced with possibilities. Dean and Alina thought they had won, that they had silenced Lia and buried the truth. But they were wrong.\nBecause now, they had me to deal with. And I wasn't going to stop until Lia was free and justice was served.\n___\nDean's POV\nThe roads blurred as I drove aimlessly, frustration boiling in my veins. How the hell had I lost them? Bianca and Jenny had been in my sight for hours, and then, like ghosts, they vanished into thin air.\nI slammed my fist against the steering wheel, the car skidding slightly before I corrected it. Something wasn't right about those two. The way they brushed me off earlier, their sudden outings-it all reeked of suspicion.\nPulling into the driveway of the pack house, I parked haphazardly and stormed inside. The house felt suffocating, its familiar walls closing in around me. I didn't bother knocking on Alina's door before barging in. She was standing by her vanity, fixing her hair, her reflection calm and collected in the mirror.\n\"What is it, Dean?\" she asked, not even glancing at me.\n\"I lost them,\" I growled, pacing the room.\n\"Who?\"\n\"Bianca and Jenny,\" I snapped. \"They've been acting strange, sneaking around, and now they're gone. I think they're up to something.\"\nThat caught her attention. She turned to face me, her brow furrowed. \"What do you mean, 'up to something'?\"\n\"I don't know,\" I admitted, running a hand through my hair. \"But they're not being subtle. They know something, Alina, and I don't like it. They've been watching me, asking too many questions.\"\nAlina crossed her arms, her gaze narrowing. \"Do you think they know about Lia?\"\nI hesitated. \"Maybe. Or worse, they could have evidence.\"\nFor a moment, silence filled the room, broken only by the ticking of the clock on the wall. Then Alina sighed, her calm demeanor replaced with a flicker of irritation.\n\"We can't afford any loose ends,\" she said. \"Keep a close eye on them, Dean. And when they return, don't let them out of your sight until they tell you everything they know.\"\n\"What if they don't talk?\"\nA wicked smile curled on her lips. \"Then make them talk.\"\nI nodded, the weight of her words settling on me. I'd do whatever it took to protect what we'd built.\n\"Where are you going?\" I asked as she picked up her coat.\n\"I have a meeting with the elders in a few minutes,\" she replied. \"They're starting to ask questions about Lia's disappearance, and I need to get ahead of it. Which reminds me-Lia needs to be ready for the meeting.\"\n\"What are you planning to do with her?\"\nAlina smirked, a cold glint in her eyes. \"I'll make sure she stays quiet. The elders just need to see her as the desperate prisoner she is. Nothing more, nothing less. After that, we can deal with her however we please.\"\nHer confidence was infectious, but I couldn't shake the gnawing feeling in my gut. Bianca and Jenny were wild cards, and if they exposed us, everything would crumble.\n\"What if the elders start digging deeper?\" I asked.\n\"They won't,\" she said firmly. \"Not if we play this right. Now, go do your job, Dean. Handle Bianca and Jenny. Leave Lia and the elders to me.\"\nI nodded again, though the unease lingered. As Alina left the room, I stood there for a moment, staring at the closed door.\nThis plan had been perfect. Every piece meticulously placed, every angle considered. But now? The cracks were starting to show, and I wasn't sure if we could patch them up in time.\nTaking a deep breath, I left Alina's room and made my way downstairs. The packed house was eerily quiet, the tension in the air thick enough to cut.\nBianca and Jenny were out there, probably plotting something, and Lia was locked away in the cellar, waiting for whatever twisted fate Alina had planned for her.\nI tightened my fists. I needed to get ahead of this. Bianca and Jenny wouldn't know what hit them, and\nLia? She'd face the elders soon enough, and after that, she wouldn't be a problem anymore.\nFor now, though, I had work to do.\n154\nLia's POV\nThe cold stone floor beneath me was a cruel reminder of my reality, my back pressed against the damp wall of the cellar. My body ached with exhaustion and pain, each bruise a testament to the torment I had endured at the hands of Dean and Alina. The cell was stifling, suffocating in its silence, and I could feel my breath becoming shallow as panic bubbled just beneath the surface. I wasn't sure how long I'd been here, but the isolation and darkness were wearing me down.\nThe faint creak of the cellar door jolted me to attention. Footsteps echoed down the stairs, slow and deliberate. I already knew who it was, even before she stepped into view.\nAlina.\nHer presence filled the room as she approached, her polished, composed demeanor standing in stark contrast to the grim surroundings. She held something in her hand something that glinted in the dim light. A dress. A ridiculous gesture of control. She tossed it onto the floor in front of me like I was nothing more than an object she could manipulate.\n\"Get up,\" she ordered sharply, \"and put this on.\"\nI didn't move at first. My muscles were stiff from sitting too long, and the idea of playing along with whatever twisted game she was setting up felt nauseating. \"Why?\" I croaked, my throat dry from the lack of water.\nAlina's lips curled into a cold smile, her eyes narrowed with disdain. \"You're meeting the elders, Lia. You're not going to that meeting looking like a prisoner. You'll put this on, and you'll do exactly as I say, or I'll drag you out of here in chains.\"\nA sickening surge of dread gripped my chest, but I fought it down. She was trying to break me. Trying to make me fear the inevitable. But I wouldn't give her that satisfaction.\nI slowly stood up, my legs trembling as I reached for the dress. It was an elegant piece, but the fabric felt like a mockery against the cold stone of the cellar. The irony wasn't lost on me Alina had no respect for anything except power, and this was just another way for her to exert control.\n\"What's the plan, Alina?\" I asked, my voice coming out raspier than I intended. I had to know. I had to understand what game she was playing.\nAlina's eyes flashed with impatience as she stared at me, her arms crossing over her chest. \"I've already told the elders everything,\" she said, her voice dripping with venom. \"That you escaped from prison on your own, that you started the fire, and that you killed Finn.\" Her words were meant to sting, and they did. \"Now you're going to play your part. You're going to confess to everything I've accused you of, and then we'll see what happens to you.\"\nI felt a surge of anger rise within me, hotter than anything I had felt before. \"You're lying,\" I spat, the words laced with venom. \"I didn't kill Finn. And I didn't start that fire. You're the one behind all of this. You and Dean.\"\nAlina's lips twisted into a cruel smile, but there was a flash of something dark in her eyes. She took a step toward me, her gaze locking onto mine with an intensity that sent a chill down my spine. \"You're not in a position to make demands, Lia,\" she hissed, her voice low and dangerous. \"If you don't keep quiet, I'll finish you off. No one will care, and no one will ever know. And you know what? I'll make sure your precious son suffers for your disobedience.\"\nThe words hit me like a punch to the gut. Merlin. She was threatening my son now. My heart raced, a cold sweat breaking out across my forehead. \"Don't you dare touch him,\" I whispered through gritted teeth. \"If you do, you'll regret it. I swear to you.\"\nAlina's smile only widened, as if she found my defiance amusing. She grabbed my arm roughly, dragging me toward the stairs, my feet stumbling as I was pulled upward. \"You're not in control here, Lia. And you never will be.\"\nMy chest tightened as we ascended the stairs, and I tried to steady my breath, to focus. This wasn't the end. It couldn't be. I couldn't let her win. I wouldn't.\nWhen we reached the top of the stairs, Alina pulled open the door to the hallway. The bright light from the elders' chamber filtered in, and I could hear the murmur of voices. My heart pounded in my chest, my body instinctively tensing as we approached the large double doors.\n\"This is it,\" Alina said, her voice tinged with satisfaction. \"You'll confess. You'll tell them everything I've said, and you'll accept whatever punishment they decide. Or I'll make sure you never see the light of day again.\"\nI forced my feet to move, my body betraying me as I was pulled forward, the door swinging open before us. The elders were already gathered inside, their faces grim and expectant.\nI stood tall, despite the fear gnawing at me from within. \"You can do whatever you want to me, Alina,\" I said, my voice unwavering. \"But I will never admit to something I didn't do. I won't be your puppet.\"\nShe shoved me forward into the room, and as the heavy doors slammed shut behind us, I realized that this was only the beginning. I would find a way to expose her, to protect Merlin and the truth. And no matter what Alina thought, this game wasn't over. Not by a long shot.\n___\nAlina's POV\nThe doors to the large hall swung open with a heavy, resounding thud as I pushed Lia forward. She stumbled slightly, still weak from her time in the cellar, but I couldn't bring myself to care. This was her punishment, and it was long overdue. She had become a thorn in my side, a complication I hadn't expected, but now I was in control. She had no choice but to bend to my will.\nI watched as Lia stood, head held high, despite the obvious strain in her posture. She had spirit, that was for sure, but spirit didn't win in this game. Power did. And I had it all. I could already see the looks on the elders' faces-some of them sympathetic, some of them indifferent, but all of them eager to see what would happen next.\nI walked to my seat at the head of the table, my eyes never leaving Lia. \"Take your seat,\" I ordered, my voice laced with authority. She hesitated for a brief moment, but eventually, she complied, sitting down at the center of the room, her eyes scanning the faces around her. It didn't matter. None of them would help her. They were all too afraid of me to challenge anything I said.\nThe meeting commenced with a few formalities, but I was already lost in my thoughts, anticipating Lia's response to the charges against her. She would confess. She had no other choice. I had prepared the narrative perfectly: that Lia had escaped from prison, that she had caused the fire, and that she was responsible for Finn's death. The elders would have no reason not to believe me. But Lia, of course, had other plans.\nWhen the floor was opened for her defense, I couldn't help but feel a slight stir of irritation as she stood and denied everything. Her voice was steady, but there was no mistaking the defiance in her eyes.\n\"I didn't kill Finn,\" Lia said, her voice firm and unwavering. \"I didn't start that fire. You're the one who's behind all of this. You, Alina.\"\nHer accusation was nothing short of audacious. The room fell into an uncomfortable silence, and for a moment, I felt the sting of her words. But I couldn't let her get away with this. Not now, not after everything I'd done to ensure her guilt would be seen by everyone.\n\"Lia,\" I said calmly, masking my anger with a veneer of patience. \"You're only digging yourself a deeper hole. This defiance won't save you.\"\nBut she didn't listen. She stared at me defiantly, and that only fueled my rage. Her refusal to acknowledge the truth was insufferable, and in that moment, I made a decision. I signaled to the elders to adjourn the meeting, to give Lia a brief respite before we continued. But I knew what would happen next-there was no way in hell she would escape the punishment she deserved.\nThe room cleared, and I walked out of the hall, a cold determination building within me. I had to deal with Lia. And I would do it in a way that made her understand exactly who was in charge.\nI made my way to the dungeons, my footsteps echoing off the stone walls as I descended into the depths of the pack house. The air was thick with a damp, oppressive scent, and the dim lighting cast shadows across the walls, making the space feel even more claustrophobic. I entered the cell where Lia was being held, my eyes narrowing as I took in her form. She was slumped against the wall, her arms crossed over her chest, her face set in that same stubborn defiance.\n\"Lia,\" I said, my voice low, as I walked toward her. \"You're being very foolish. Your denial is only making things worse for you. You have no idea what I'm capable of.\"\nShe lifted her head slowly, her eyes meeting mine with an intensity that sent a shiver down my spine. \"You think I'm afraid of you?\" she asked, her voice steady but tinged with exhaustion. \"You think I'm going to bend to your threats? You're wrong.\"\nI smirked, leaning in closer, my face just inches from hers. \"I don't need you to be afraid of me. I just need you to understand that you have no choice. You will confess in the next meeting. If you don't, I'll make sure that the consequences are worse than anything you've ever imagined. I'll take everything from you-your son, your freedom, your life. And there won't be anyone left to save you.\"\nHer face remained stoic, but I could see the flicker of fear in her eyes. She wasn't as strong as she pretended to be. And I was going to make her break.\n\"I'll never confess to something I didn't do,\" Lia muttered, the words coming out barely above a whisper. \"You can threaten me all you want, but I'll never be your pawn.\"\nI laughed, the sound echoing in the cold, empty space. \"You'll see, Lia. You'll confess, or I'll make sure you wish you had.\"\nI turned on my heel, walking toward the door, but I paused before I left, turning back to face her one last time. \"You've made your choice, Lia. And now you'll suffer the consequences.\"\nWith that, I left the dungeon, the heavy door slamming shut behind me. I didn't need to hear any more of her useless defiance. The next time we met with the elders, she would h\nave no choice but to admit to the crimes she had committed-or face a far worse fate.\n155\nBianca's POV\nJenny and I stepped out of the car, exhausted but feeling a small sense of accomplishment after managing to give Dean the slip earlier. It had been a long day, and all I wanted was to get inside, grab something to eat, and collapse on my bed. But as soon as we walked toward the front door, I saw him. Dean. Leaning casually against the porch railing, his arms crossed over his chest and a smirk playing on his lips.\n\"What's this?\" Jenny muttered under her breath, her expression immediately hardening.\nI glanced at her, then back at Dean. \"Trouble,\" I replied quietly.\n\"Ladies,\" Dean greeted us, his tone laced with mock politeness. \"Long day?\"\nI rolled my eyes and walked past him toward the door, but he stepped in front of me, blocking my way. \"Not so fast,\" he said. \"Where have you two been?\"\n\"Out,\" Jenny replied nonchalantly, folding her arms across her chest. \"What's it to you?\"\nDean's smirk deepened as his eyes narrowed. \"Out where? Because last I checked, Alina gave me strict instructions to monitor everyone's movements. So, I suggest you tell me the truth.\"\nI couldn't help but laugh at the audacity of this man. \"You're really out here playing watchdog for Alina? That's pathetic, even for you, Dean.\"\nHis jaw tightened, but he didn't respond to the insult. Instead, he turned his attention to Jenny. \"I'm serious. Where were you?\"\nJenny rolled her eyes dramatically. \"We went to the mall, Dean. Do you want a detailed list of the things we bought, too? Maybe the receipt?\"\nDean wasn't buying it, and his piercing gaze lingered on us as though he could see through the flimsy excuse. \"The mall, huh?\" he said slowly, his tone dripping with skepticism. \"And you expect me to believe that?\"\n\"Believe whatever you want,\" I said, stepping closer to him, my voice firm. \"But if you're trying to accuse us of something, you better have proof. Otherwise, get out of our way.\"\nDean's smirk faltered for a moment, and I could see the frustration brewing behind his eyes. \"You think you're clever, don't you?\" he muttered.\nJenny scoffed. \"We don't have to think it. We know it.\"\nBefore he could respond, I pushed past him and opened the door, motioning for Jenny to follow me. She didn't hesitate, and together we walked into the house, leaving Dean standing on the porch, seething.\nAs soon as we were inside, I locked the door behind us and let out a heavy sigh. \"He's definitely suspicious,\" I said, leaning against the door.\nJenny nodded, tossing her bag onto the couch. \"Yeah, but let him be. He doesn't have anything on us.\"\n\"For now,\" I added, my voice low. \"We have to be careful, Jenny. He's not going to let this go.\"\nJenny sat down, crossing her legs and drumming her fingers on the armrest. \"Let him try. If he pushes too hard, we'll deal with him. He's all bark and no bite.\"\nI wasn't so sure. Dean was dangerous, and we both knew it. But we didn't have time to dwell on that now. There was too much at stake.\n\"What about the plan?\" I asked, lowering my voice. \"Do you think Luca believed you?\"\nJenny nodded. \"He did. He's on board. But we need to act fast. The longer we wait, the more time Dean and Alina have to cover their tracks.\"\nI chewed on my bottom lip, my mind racing. \"We need to figure out our next move. We can't just sit here and wait for something to happen.\"\nJenny leaned forward, her expression serious. \"I agree. But first, we need to be absolutely sure we can trust Luca. If he slips up, this whole thing could fall apart.\"\nI nodded. \"You're right. Let's keep the details vague for now. Just enough to keep him on our side without giving away too much.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Jenny said, a small smile playing on her lips. \"We've got this, Bianca. We just need to stay one step ahead of them.\"\nAs much as I wanted to believe her, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that settled in my chest. Dean wasn't going to give up easily, and neither was Alina. We were playing a dangerous game, and the stakes were higher than ever.\n\"We should get some rest,\" I said finally, glancing at the clock. \"Tomorrow's going to be a long day.\"\nJenny nodded, standing up and stretching. \"Yeah. Let's get some sleep. We'll figure out our next move in the morning.\"\nI watched her head toward her room, my mind still racing with thoughts and possibilities. Dean might have been left standing outside tonight, but I knew he wasn't done with us. And neither was Alina.\nWe were in the middle of a storm, and the only way out was to fight. But no matter what, I wasn't going to let them win. Not this time.\n___\nAlina's POV\nThe sound of my heels echoed in the hallway as I made my way to Dean's room. The meeting with the elders had been frustrating, to say the least. Lia had denied every accusation, and despite my carefully constructed lies, they were hesitant to deliver a final verdict. They wanted more evidence. Evidence I didn't have.\nI reached Dean's door and knocked once before pushing it open. He was sitting on the edge of his bed, staring blankly at the floor. He looked up when I entered, his expression unreadable.\n\"We need to talk,\" I said, closing the door behind me.\n\"About the meeting?\" he asked, his tone neutral.\nI nodded, walking over to the chair across from him and sitting down. \"It didn't go as planned. Lia denied everything, of course, and the elders decided to adjourn the session. They want more time to 'investigate.'\" I rolled my eyes. \"As if they'll find anything.\"\nDean leaned back, his arms crossed over his chest. \"So, what now?\"\n\"Now,\" I said, leaning forward, \"we have to make sure Lia doesn't have the chance to twist the narrative. She needs to confess, Dean. If she doesn't, the elders might start asking the wrong questions. Questions that could lead back to us.\"\nHe nodded but didn't say anything.\n\"What about Bianca and Jenny?\" I asked, narrowing my eyes. \"Did you find out anything?\"\nDean sighed, shaking his head. \"No. I followed them for most of the day, but they managed to lose me. I don't know where they went or what they were doing, but it's clear they're hiding something.\"\nI frowned. \"They're up to no good. I can feel it. We need to keep a closer eye on them, Dean. If they're working against us, we can't let them get away with it.\"\n\"I'll handle it,\" he said, his voice firm. \"Don't worry. We'll get to the bottom of this.\"\nI studied him for a moment, searching for any signs of doubt or hesitation. Dean was usually so composed, so confident, but tonight he seemed... off.\n\"Good,\" I said, deciding to let it go for now. \"Because we don't have time for mistakes. The elders are already skeptical, and the last thing we need is for Bianca and Jenny to start stirring up trouble.\"\nDean nodded but remained silent.\n\"There's something else,\" I said after a moment. \"When I went to the cellar to get Lia for the meeting, she said something that caught my attention.\"\nDean looked at me, his expression carefully neutral. \"What did she say?\"\n\"She said that the real murderer might still be out there,\" I replied, watching him closely. \"That whoever killed Finn could be waiting to strike again. She even suggested that I could be next if I'm not careful.\"\nFor the briefest moment, I thought I saw a flicker of something in Dean's eyes-fear, maybe, or guilt-but it was gone as quickly as it appeared.\n\"Did she?\" he said, his tone casual.\n\"Yes,\" I said, leaning forward. \"And I noticed you looked... shocked just now. Is there something you're not telling me, Dean?\"\nHe shook his head quickly, almost too quickly. \"No. There's nothing. I'm just surprised Lia would say something like that. She's clearly trying to mess with your head, Alina. Don't let her get to you.\"\nI narrowed my eyes, studying him carefully. Dean was a good liar, but I had spent enough time around him to know when something was off.\n\"She also said that the truth will come out eventually,\" I added, watching his reaction closely.\nDean's jaw tightened, but he said nothing.\n\"Dean,\" I said, my voice low. \"If there's something I need to know, now is the time to tell me.\"\n\"There's nothing,\" he said firmly, standing up and walking over to the window. \"Lia's just trying to save herself. She'll say anything to get under your skin.\"\nI didn't believe him, but I decided not to press the issue. Not yet, anyway. There were more important things to deal with right now.\n\"Fine,\" I said, standing up and smoothing down my dress. \"But we need to act fast. Lia has to confess at the next meeting, no matter what it takes. If she doesn't, everything we've worked for could fall apart.\"\nDean turned to face me, his expression unreadable. \"She'll confess,\" he said quietly.\n\"She better,\" I said, walking toward the door. \"Because if she doesn't, she won't be the only one facing consequences.\"\nWith that, I left the room, my mind racing. Something wasn't right with Dean, and I was going\nto find out what it was. But first, I had to deal with Lia.\nIf she thought she could outsmart me, she was in for a rude awakening.\n156\nDean's POV\nI leaned against the cold windowpane of my room, Alina's words echoing in my mind. \"The truth will come out eventually.\" She had said it so casually, but the way her eyes pierced mine told me she suspected something. Alina wasn't stupid if anything, she was the most cunning person I'd ever met.\nBut I couldn't let her unravel this. Not now, not ever.\nPacing the room, I pulled out my phone and dialed one of my guards. \"I need eyes on Bianca and Jenny,\" I ordered, my voice cold and sharp. \"From now on, I want them followed whenever they leave the house. I want to know where they go, who they meet, and what they're planning. Understood?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" the voice on the other end replied.\nI ended the call and tossed the phone onto the bed, rubbing a hand over my face. Bianca and Jenny were up to something, and it was only a matter of time before they made their move. But I wouldn't give them the chance to ruin everything I'd worked for.\nPulling on my jacket, I left my room and made my way down the long corridor toward the dungeon. The air grew colder with each step, the dim lighting casting eerie shadows on the stone walls. My footsteps echoed, a rhythmic reminder of my power and control in this house.\nWhen I reached the heavy iron door, I paused for a moment, letting the satisfaction of what I was about to do wash over me. Lia had been a thorn in my side for far too long, and seeing her in that dark, damp cell was a pleasure I intended to savor.\nPushing the door open, I stepped inside. The room smelled of damp stone and despair, and in the corner, Lia sat slumped against the wall, her once-bright eyes dulled by weeks of captivity. She looked up as I entered, and for a brief moment, something flickered in her gaze hope, maybe, or defiance.\n\"Dean,\" she said, her voice hoarse.\nI chuckled, crossing my arms as I leaned against the cell bars. \"Well, well, look at you,\" I said, smirking. \"How the mighty have fallen.\"\nLia didn't respond, her lips pressing into a thin line.\n\"You know,\" I continued, \"I always thought you looked better in the light. But seeing you here, in the dark, helpless and broken it suits you.\"\n\"Why are you here, Dean?\" she asked, her voice stronger now.\nI tilted my head, pretending to ponder her question. \"Why am I here? Good question. Maybe I just wanted to see you, Lia. Or maybe I wanted to remind you how you got here.\"\nHer jaw tightened, and I could see the hatred burning in her eyes.\n\"You could have had everything, you know,\" I said, stepping closer to the bars. \"You could have had me. But no, you had to go and choose Finn.\" I sneered, the name tasting bitter on my tongue. \"He wasn't good enough for you, Lia. He never was. So, I did what I had to do.\"\nHer eyes widened slightly, and I knew she understood exactly what I was saying.\n\"You killed him,\" she whispered, her voice trembling.\nI shrugged, feigning nonchalance. \"I wouldn't put it so bluntly, but yes, I made sure he was out of the picture. Permanently. And look where it got you, Lia. All alone, rotting in this cell. Was he worth it?\"\nHer hands clenched into fists, her whole body trembling with anger. \"You're a monster,\" she spat.\nI laughed, the sound echoing through the small space. \"Maybe I am. But I'm a monster who gets what he wants. And right now, what I want is for you to confess. Alina's patience is wearing thin, and trust me, you don't want her to lose it.\"\nLia didn't say anything, her gaze dropping to the floor.\nI crouched down, gripping the bars as I lowered my voice. \"You can end this, Lia. Just admit to everything, and maybe. just mJust I'll convince Alina to show you some mercy. But if you keep fighting, you'll regret it.\"\nHer head snapped up, and for a moment, I saw the fire in her eyes again. \"I'll never confess to something I didn't do,\" she said, her voice steady.\nI sighed, standing up and shaking my head. \"Suit yourself. But don't say I didn't warn you.\"\nTurning on my heel, I walked out of the cell, my smirk returning as I heard her muttered curses behind me. Lia could fight all she wanted, but in the end, I would win.\nI always did.\n___\nLia's POV\nThe echo of Dean's boots faded, leaving behind a suffocating silence that settled over the cold dungeon. His words still rang in my ears, cruel and venomous. He thought he'd broken me. He thought locking me in here would silence me. But he was wrong.\nI leaned my head back against the damp stone wall, my mind racing. Dean's arrogance was his weakness. He always believed he was in control, but cracks were beginning to show in his carefully constructed facade. All I needed was a way to exploit them.\nThe sound of muffled voices outside the dungeon door snapped me out of my thoughts. The door creaked open, and two figures stepped inside. Bianca and Jenny.\nI straightened, my body tense. \"What do you want?\" I asked, my voice sharper than I intended.\n\"We're here to help,\" Bianca said, her voice steady as she approached the bars of my cell.\nI scoffed, shaking my head. \"Help? That's rich. The last time I trusted someone, I ended up in here. Forgive me if I'm not exactly eager to jump at another opportunity to be betrayed.\"\nJenny folded her arms, her expression serious. \"We're not Dean. And we're not Alina. We don't have anything to gain from helping you, Lia. But we do have a lot to lose if we don't.\"\nI narrowed my eyes, scrutinizing them both. \"And what exactly do you think you're going to lose?\"\nBianca stepped closer, her gaze unwavering. \"Everything. Alina and Dean are out of control. They're playing a dangerous game, and if we don't stop them, they'll destroy all of us. You included.\"\nHer words hung in the air, heavy with truth. But I wasn't ready to believe them. Not yet.\n\"And why should I trust you?\" I asked, my voice cold.\nJenny exchanged a glance with Bianca before pulling out her phone. \"You don't have to trust us. But maybe you'll trust Luca.\"\nMy heart skipped a beat at the mention of his name. \"Luca?\"\nBianca nodded, taking the phone from Jenny and dialing a number. She held it out to me as it rang. \"Talk to him. Hear what he has to say.\"\nI hesitated, staring at the phone as if it might bite me. Then, cautiously, I reached through the bars and took it.\n\"Hello?\" Luca's voice came through the speaker, warm and familiar.\nMy throat tightened, and for a moment, I couldn't speak. \"L-Luca?\"\n\"Lia!\" His voice was filled with relief. \"Thank god, you're okay. Are you hurt? What's going on?\"\nTears pricked at my eyes as the sound of his voice washed over me like a balm. \"I... I don't know what to say. I didn't think I'd ever hear your voice again.\"\n\"I'm here, Lia,\" he said firmly. \"And I'm going to get you out of there. Bianca and Jenny told me everything. They're on our side.\"\nI glanced at the two women, their expressions earnest. For the first time, a sliver of hope pierced through my doubt.\n\"You believe them?\" I asked Luca, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\"I do,\" he said without hesitation. \"They've been risking a lot to help you, Lia. Trust them. Please.\"\nI closed my eyes, letting his words sink in. Luca wouldn't lie to me. If he trusted them, then maybe I could too.\n\"Okay,\" I said finally, my voice shaky but resolute. \"I'll trust them. For now.\"\n\"Good,\" Luca said, his tone firm. \"Stay strong, Lia. We're going to bring you home. I promise.\"\nTears spilled over, and I quickly wiped them away. \"Thank you, Luca.\"\nThe line went dead, and I handed the phone back to Bianca, my fingers trembling.\n\"You've got my attention,\" I said, my voice steadier now. \"What's the plan?\"\nBianca and Jenny exchanged a determined glance before turning back to me.\n\"We're going to take Alina and Dean down,\" Jenny said, her voice filled with conviction. \"And you're going to help us do it.\"\nFor the first ti\nme in what felt like forever, I felt a spark of hope ignite in my chest. Maybe, just maybe, I wasn't as alone as I thought.\n157\nLuca's POV\nHearing Lia's voice had done something to me. It was as if the weight of the entire world had lifted, even if just for a moment. She was alive. She was strong, though I could tell she was barely holding on. That was all I needed to ignite the fire in me. I wouldn't stop until she was out of that dungeon and safe in my arms again.\nI sat at my desk, Bianca and Jenny's videos and pictures of the dungeon laid out before me. The images showed every detail the cold, damp walls, the heavy iron bars, the chains. Each photo made my blood boil, but I forced myself to stay calm. This wasn't the time for emotions. It was time for action.\nI transferred the files to multiple systems, uploading them to encrypted drives and saving them on several flash drives. Losing this evidence wasn't an option. Dean would stop at nothing to keep his secrets buried, and I wasn't going to let him.\n\"Benedicta,\" I called out, and moments later, she entered the room, her brow furrowed in concern.\n\"What is it, Luca?\"\nI handed her a small stack of flash drives. \"I need you to hide these in the cellar under your house. Make sure they're somewhere no one would think to look. Dean can't find these, no matter what.\"\nHer eyes widened as she took the drives. \"Luca, what are you planning?\"\n\"Everything,\" I said simply. \"And nothing he'll see coming.\"\nShe hesitated but nodded. \"I'll keep them safe. But you need to be careful. Dean isn't someone to underestimate.\"\n\"I know,\" I said, standing and stretching. The tension in my body refused to leave, but I couldn't afford to let it show. \"Which is why I'm going to meet him.\"\n\"What?\" she exclaimed, her voice rising in alarm. \"Are you out of your mind?\"\n\"I don't have a choice,\" I said firmly. \"Dean thinks he's untouchable. If I want to bring him down, I need to get close enough to gather more evidence. Bianca and Jenny's help has been invaluable, but it's not enough. I need his words, his confessions.\"\n\"And you think he'll just hand them to you?\"\n\"Not exactly,\" I said, pulling a small microchip from my pocket. \"This will record everything. I'll plant it on his clothes during our meeting.\"\nBenedicta looked at me like I'd lost my mind. \"And what happens when he figures out what you're doing? Luca, this is dangerous!\"\n\"I know,\" I said softly, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"But I don't have another option. If I don't do this, Lia stays in that dungeon. And I'm not letting that happen.\"\nHer shoulders slumped, and she let out a shaky breath. \"Fine. But promise me you'll be careful.\"\n\"I will,\" I assured her. \"But you need to be watchful too. Dean is sneaky, and if he suspects anything, he might try something while I'm gone. Stay alert, and keep Merlin close.\"\nHer expression hardened, and she nodded. \"I'll watch him like a hawk.\"\n\"Good.\" I grabbed my jacket and slipped the microchip into the inner pocket. My heart pounded in my chest, but I pushed the fear aside. This wasn't about me. It was about Lia.\nAs I stepped out of the house, I turned back to Benedicta one last time. \"If anything happens, don't wait for me. Call Luca or Bianca. They'll know what to do.\"\n\"Nothing will happen,\" she said, her voice firm. \"But I'll be ready.\"\nI nodded, satisfied, and headed to the car. The drive to meet Dean felt longer than it should have, every passing second weighing on me. My mind raced with scenarios, each more dangerous than the last. But I clung to the plan.\nDean had no idea what was coming. He thought he held all the power, but he'd underestimated me. This wasn't just about saving Lia it was about justice. Dean needed to pay for everything he'd done, and I was going to make sure he did.\nAs I approached the meeting point, I took a deep breath, steeling myself. This was just the beginning. I had to play the part, act as if nothing was wrong, all while collecting every word, every slip-up, every detail that could bring him down.\nFor Lia. For justice. For freedom.\nI stepped out of the car, the microchip safely tucked in my pocket, and made my way to the meeting spot. The game was on, and I was ready to play.\n___\nDean's POV\nThe couch beneath me offered little comfort. For hours, I'd been trying to rest, but my mind wouldn't let me. The weight of everything-the secrets, the lies, the constant juggling of power-pressed down like a vice on my chest. I leaned back, closing my eyes, but even that didn't offer reprieve.\nThen my phone rang.\nI opened my eyes, irritated. Reaching for it, I glanced at the caller ID. Luca.\nA part of me wanted to ignore it, let him stew in whatever thoughts had driven him to contact me. But I couldn't. Luca wasn't someone you brushed aside-not when he was involved with something as delicate as Lia.\n\"Dean,\" I answered, my voice curt.\n\"We need to meet,\" he said, his tone calm but firm.\n\"Why?\"\n\"It's important.\"\nI waited for him to elaborate, but he didn't. He never gave more than necessary. That was Luca-controlled, calculating, and always several steps ahead.\n\"Fine. Where?\"\nHe gave me the location, and I ended the call without another word.\nI stood, stretching out the stiffness in my body before heading to the closet. Pulling out a dark shirt and slacks, I dressed quickly, mentally rehearsing my alibi. If Alina asked where I was going-or where I'd been later-I'd tell her I needed to unwind. To clear my head.\nShe wouldn't press. Alina knew better than to question me when I was in this mood.\nSliding my shoes on, I grabbed my car keys and stepped outside. The crisp night air met me as I approached the sleek black car waiting in the driveway. I got in, started the engine, and pulled out onto the empty road.\nAs the city lights blurred past, my mind began dissecting the situation. Why had Luca called me? What did he want?\nI tapped my fingers against the steering wheel, my grip tightening. Luca wasn't stupid. He wouldn't reach out unless he had a reason-a good one.\nThe memory of our last conversation resurfaced, that heated moment when I'd let my guard down and confessed to killing Finn. A mistake, no matter how fleeting. Luca was too sharp to let something like that slide.\nI sighed, frustration bubbling beneath the surface.\nThis wasn't how things were supposed to go. I'd been careful, meticulous in covering my tracks. But Luca had a way of unraveling even the most carefully laid plans. He was like a shadow-silent, persistent, and impossible to shake.\nI glanced at the GPS, noting I was nearing the meeting point.\nWhatever he had planned, I needed to be ready.\nThe location he'd chosen was secluded, dimly lit by a single flickering streetlamp. My instincts flared. It felt too perfect for a setup.\nI parked the car but didn't step out immediately. Reaching for my phone, I dialed Luca's number.\n\"Are you alone?\" I asked when he picked up.\n\"Yes,\" he replied without hesitation.\n\"And why do you want to meet?\"\n\"To negotiate. About Lia. Nothing else.\"\nI stayed silent for a moment, weighing his words. Negotiate? Luca rarely used that word. He was direct, preferring action over diplomacy.\nI scanned the area through the windshield, my unease growing. Negotiation or not, Luca wasn't to be underestimated. He'd do whatever it took to protect Lia-even if it meant crossing lines he'd never considered before.\nBut I wasn't one to back down.\nAfter a moment's pause, I opened the car door, stepping out into the cool night.\nEach step I took toward the meeting point was calculated, and deliberate. I wouldn't give him the satisfaction of catching me off guard.\nThis time, I'd be ready.\n158\nLuca's POV\nThe air was heavy as I waited at the secluded spot I had chosen for the meeting. The dim glow of the streetlamp above barely illuminated the area, making it the perfect place for a private confrontation. My fingers drummed against my thigh as I replayed the plan in my mind. Dean wasn't stupid-he'd be on guard.\nI heard the faint hum of an approaching car and looked up, spotting Dean's black vehicle as it rolled to a stop a few feet away. He didn't step out immediately. I knew he'd call first, testing the waters. My phone vibrated, and I answered it on the first ring.\n\"Are you alone?\" Dean's voice was clipped, suspicious.\n\"Yes,\" I replied evenly, keeping my tone calm.\n\"What do you want?\"\n\"To negotiate. About Lia. Nothing else.\"\nThere was a pause before I heard his car door open. I slid my phone back into my pocket, watching as he approached. His steps were measured and deliberate. Dean always carried himself like a predator, confident and ready to strike.\n\"You have five minutes, Luca,\" he said as he stopped a few feet away from me. \"Say what you need to say.\"\nI squared my shoulders, refusing to let his imposing demeanor intimidate me. \"You know why I called you here, Dean. This is about Lia. Let her go.\"\nDean smirked, his lips curling into that smug expression I'd grown to hate. \"And why would I do that? She's exactly where she belongs.\"\n\"Because we both know the charges against her are fabricated,\" I shot back. \"You're the one pulling the strings, Dean. Just name your price, and I'll pay it. Whatever it takes to set her free.\"\nHis smirk deepened, and he took a step closer. \"Whatever it takes? That's a bold offer, Luca. But you see, it's not about money or power. It's about Lia. She made her choice, and it wasn't me.\"\nI clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms as I forced myself to stay calm. \"This isn't about the past, Dean. It's about doing what's right.\"\n\"Right?\" He let out a bitter laugh. \"Do you even hear yourself? What's right doesn't matter in this game. You should know that by now.\"\nI stared at him, my jaw tightening. \"You killed Finn, didn't you?\"\nDean's eyes narrowed, but he didn't deny it. Instead, he tilted his head, a sly grin spreading across his face. \"And if I did?\"\n\"You're admitting it, then,\" I said, my voice sharp.\nHe leaned in slightly, his tone dropping to a low, mocking whisper. \"It doesn't matter if I admit it, Luca. Alina won't believe you. You can scream it from the rooftops, show her evidence, and she'll still take my side. You're wasting your time.\"\nHis words stung because I knew there was truth to them. Alina was blinded by her loyalty to Dean, no matter how dark his deeds were. But I couldn't let that stop me.\n\"She deserves to know,\" I said firmly. \"And I'll make sure she does.\"\nDean's expression darkened for a moment before he chuckled softly. \"Enough of this,\" he said. \"You said you wanted to negotiate. So, what are you offering?\"\n\"Anything,\" I said without hesitation. \"Whatever you want, just let Lia go.\"\nHis gaze sharpened, and for a moment, he seemed to be considering my words. But then his smile returned, cruel and calculating.\n\"I don't want money, Luca. I don't want power. What I want is Lia.\"\nMy stomach twisted at his words, and I took an instinctive step forward. \"She's not yours to have, Dean. You can't force her to love you.\"\n\"Love has nothing to do with it,\" he snapped. \"She'll stay with me because I say so. She'll learn to obey, to respect me.\"\n\"You're delusional,\" I said, my voice rising. \"You think you can control her, but Lia's stronger than you realize. She'll never be yours.\"\nDean's smirk faltered, and for the first time, I saw a flicker of something else-anger, frustration. \"You think you can save her?\" he said, his tone cold. \"You think you're some kind of hero?\"\n\"I don't think, Dean. I know I can save her,\" I replied, my voice steady. \"And I will, no matter what it takes.\"\nWe stood there in tense silence, the weight of our words hanging between us.\n\"This conversation is over,\" Dean finally said, stepping back. \"You've wasted enough of my time.\"\nI didn't stop him as he turned and walked away. But as I watched him go, I felt a renewed sense of determination.\nDean might think he held all the cards, but he didn't know me as well as he thought. I wasn't backing down-not until Lia was free and he was exposed for the monster he truly was.\n___\nBianca's POV\nJenny's phone buzzed on the table, shattering the uneasy silence between us. I glanced at her, and she gave me a small nod before picking it up. The name on the screen flashed \"Luca.\" My heartbeat quickened. If Luca was calling now, it had to be important.\nJenny swiped to answer, putting the call on speaker.\n\"Luca,\" she said, her voice steady.\n\"Listen carefully,\" Luca's voice came through, low and urgent. \"Dean's more dangerous than we thought. I managed to record part of my meeting with him. I'm sending you the audio now.\"\nJenny and I exchanged a look. Luca's words sent a chill down my spine. I grabbed the phone, my hands shaking slightly as I spoke. \"What else did he say, Luca?\"\n\"He admitted to killing Finn,\" Luca said, his voice hard. \"But he's confident no one will believe it. Alina is blind to his faults, and Dean knows it.\"\nMy jaw clenched. Finn's murder had haunted us all, but now that we knew the truth, the weight of it was almost unbearable.\n\"Luca,\" Jenny said, her voice trembling slightly, \"what do we do now?\"\n\"I need you two to be my eyes and ears,\" Luca said firmly. \"Follow Dean's movements, dig into his activities, and find something solid something undeniable. We need evidence that can't be ignored.\"\nJenny nodded, though Luca couldn't see her. \"Got it. Send us the audio,\" she said.\n\"Already done,\" he replied. \"Be careful. Dean's not stupid, and he won't hesitate to hurt anyone who gets in his way.\"\nThe call ended, leaving an air of tension in the room. Seconds later, Jenny's phone chimed with the incoming file. She opened it, and we listened to the recording in silence. Dean's voice was unmistakable, laced with arrogance and malice as he confessed to Finn's murder.\nI felt my blood boil. Finn didn't deserve this. He had been good-kind. He loved Lia, and now his life was reduced to nothing more than a power play for Dean.\nAs we processed Luca's instructions, the faint sound of a car engine reached my ears. I stiffened, glancing out the window. Headlights illuminated the driveway as a sleek black car came into view.\n\"Dean,\" I whispered, my voice cold.\nJenny turned to me, her eyes wide. \"What do we do?\"\n\"I'll handle him,\" I said, standing up.\n\"Bianca-\"\n\"No,\" I cut her off, my tone firm. \"I need to do this. Trust me.\"\nWithout waiting for her reply, I headed toward the door. My mind raced as I thought about how to approach him. Dean was cunning, but I knew how to play his game.\nAs I stepped outside, Dean was already getting out of his car. He shut the door with a soft thud and turned to me, his expression unreadable.\n\"Bianca,\" he greeted, his voice calm but sharp. \"What brings you out here at this hour?\"\nI folded my arms, schooling my features into an indifferent mask. \"I should be asking you that. Where are you coming from?\"\nDean raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips. \"Since when do I report to you?\"\n\"Since you started acting suspicious,\" I shot back. \"You disappear without explanation, and then Finn dies? You can't expect me not to wonder.\"\nHe chuckled darkly, taking a step closer. \"You're pretending, Bianca. You don't care about Finn, not really.\"\nMy stomach twisted, but I kept my expression neutral. \"And what makes you think that?\"\n\"Because I know you,\" Dean said, his tone dripping with confidence. \"You're not mourning Finn. You're angry because you didn't have him. You loved him, didn't you? But he was too blinded by Lia to notice you.\"\nHis words hit harder than I expected, but I refused to show it. Instead, I leaned into the act, letting my bitterness show. \"You're right,\" I said, my voice low. \"I loved Finn. I wanted him, but Lia stole him from me. So don't tell me I'm pretending. I want her to rot in that cell just as much as you do.\"\nDean's eyes narrowed slightly as if he were trying to decipher whether I was lying or not. \"Is that so?\" he asked, his voice softer now, almost mocking.\n\"Yes,\" I said firmly. \"But that doesn't mean I'm not curious about who actually killed him. Was it you, Dean? Did you do it?\"\nHis smirk returned, cold and cruel. \"You're playing a dangerous game, Bianca. Be careful where you tread.\"\nI stared at him, my pulse racing as I held his gaze. His non-answer was answered enough. He had killed Finn, but he wasn't going to admit it outright not here, not now.\n\"Maybe I am,\" I said evenly. \"But you should be careful too, Dean. People are watching.\"\nWith that, I turned and walked back toward the house, my heart pounding in my chest. Dean's eyes burned into my back, but I didn't look back. This was far from over.\n159\nLia's POV\nThe sound of the dungeon gate creaking open jolted me awake. My eyes snapped toward the iron bars, and I sat up on the cold, damp cot, my heart pounding. The rusted hinges screeched, echoing ominously in the silence of the room. A tall guard stepped in, followed by a maid clutching a tray of food.\n\"Eat,\" the maid said curtly, placing the tray on the ground with a loud thud. Her eyes were cold as they met mine. \"You'll need your strength for today. Lady Alina has plans for you.\"\nMy stomach twisted at her words, but I didn't show it. I glared at her instead. \"What plans?\" I asked sharply.\nThe maid smirked. \"You'll see soon enough,\" she said. \"After all, killers don't deserve comfort.\"\n\"I didn't kill anyone!\" I shot back, the chains around my wrists clinking as I stood. My voice echoed in the small cell. \"So, you better watch your mouth.\"\nThe maid laughed bitterly, her voice grating on my nerves. \"Save your lies for someone who cares,\" she said. \"Everyone knows what you did. You're nothing but a murderer. A liar. You deserve no peace, no pity, and no mercy.\"\nI took a step forward, my hands trembling with rage. \"Say that again,\" I challenged.\nHer eyes narrowed as she raised her hand as if to strike me. I flinched but held my ground, ready to fight back.\n\"Stop!\" Bianca's voice rang out, cutting through the tension like a blade.\nThe maid froze her hand still in the air. Both of us turned to see Bianca standing at the entrance, her expression dark with anger.\n\"What do you think you're doing?\" Bianca demanded, her voice cold and sharp.\nThe maid stammered, \"I-I was just-\"\n\"Just what?\" Bianca interrupted, stepping closer. \"Overstepping your bounds? Who gave you the right to touch her?\"\nThe maid lowered her gaze, but Bianca wasn't finished. \"Get out,\" she ordered her voice firm.\nThe maid hesitated, her lips parting as if to protest, but Bianca's glare silenced her. She grabbed the empty tray and scurried out of the cell, her footsteps fading quickly.\nBianca turned to the guard next. \"Leave us,\" she commanded.\nThe guard hesitated, his eyes darting between Bianca and me, but eventually, he nodded and exited the cell, closing the gate behind him.\nI stared at Bianca, confusion and suspicion swirling in my mind. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked, my voice rough.\nShe sighed, running a hand through her hair. \"Trying to stop you from getting killed,\" she said bluntly.\nI scoffed, crossing my arms. \"Why? So you can feel better about yourself? Spare me the act, Bianca.\"\nHer jaw tightened, but she didn't respond right away. Instead, she moved to the corner of the cell and leaned against the wall. \"I'm not here to argue with you,\" she said. \"I'm here because I know you didn't kill Finn.\"\nHer words stunned me into silence. I searched her face for any hint of deceit, but she seemed sincere.\n\"If you know that, then why am I still here?\" I asked bitterly.\n\"Because proving it isn't easy,\" she admitted. \"Dean's got everyone convinced that you're guilty. And Alina she's not exactly the forgiving type.\"\nI laughed humorlessly. \"Tell me something I don't know.\"\nBianca sighed again, her gaze softening. \"Look, I'm trying to help you,\" she said. \"But I can't do it alone. You need to trust me.\"\n\"Trust you?\" I repeated, my voice rising. \"How can I trust you when you're part of the same group that put me here?\"\nShe didn't flinch at my accusation. Instead, she stepped closer, her eyes locking onto mine. \"You don't have a choice,\" she said simply. \"Unless you'd rather rot here and let them win.\"\nI stared at her, my heart pounding. She wasn't wrong. As much as I hated to admit it, I didn't have any other options.\n\"What's your plan?\" I asked reluctantly.\nA small smile tugged at her lips, but it didn't reach her eyes. \"First, we need to figure out what Alina's planning for you. And then\" She trailed off, her expression hardening. \"Then we find a way to expose Dean for the snake he is.\"\nHer words ignited a flicker of hope in my chest, but I quickly squashed it. I couldn't afford to get my hopes up, not yet.\n\"I still don't trust you,\" I said, my voice quiet but firm.\nBianca nodded. \"Fair enough,\" she said. \"But trust or not, I'm not leaving you to face this alone.\"\nHer determination caught me off guard. For the first time since I'd been thrown into this dungeon, I felt a sliver of hope. Maybe, just maybe, I wasn't as alone as I thought.\n___\nBianca's POV\nThe dim light of the dungeon made Lia's face look even paler than I remembered. I crouched next to her, lowering my voice so no one outside could hear. \"Lia,\" I began, \"I need you to stay strong. We're working on a plan to get you out of this.\"\nShe looked at me skeptically, her eyes sunken from exhaustion. \"What plan? Bianca, do you really think there's a way out of this? Dean has everyone convinced I killed Finn.\"\nI leaned closer. \"Listen to me. Luca, Jenny, and I had a meeting last night. We're gathering evidence against Dean. Luca already recorded him confessing to killing Finn. We're careful, but we're making progress. It's only a matter of time before we expose him for the liar and murderer he is.\"\nHer lips trembled as she absorbed my words. \"You're serious?\" she whispered, her voice cracking.\nI nodded, gripping her hand tightly. \"Dead serious. We've already started. Luca sent us recordings, and we're tracking Dean's moves. Trust me, Lia. This isn't over yet.\"\nFor the first time in days, a faint flicker of hope lit her eyes. \"Thank you,\" she said, her voice barely audible. \"Thank you for believing in me. I was starting to lose hope.\"\nMy heart ached at her words, but I forced a reassuring smile. \"You're not alone in this. We're going to get you out of here, no matter what it takes.\"\nShe nodded weakly, and I stood, glancing at the door to ensure the coast was still clear. \"Hang in there. I'll check on you soon,\" I said, giving her one last look before leaving the dungeon.\nAs I made my way to the breakfast room, my mind raced. Dean's confidence was his weakness. He didn't realize we were closing in on him, and I planned to use that to my advantage.\nWhen I entered the dining room, I was immediately met with a sight that made my blood boil. Dean was seated at the table with Alina and Jenny, eating as if he owned the place. How dare he?\n\"Why is Dean eating here?\" I asked, my tone sharp as I approached the table.\nAlina looked up from her plate, her expression cool and dismissive. \"Bianca, mind your business,\" she said, her voice dripping with disdain. \"Besides, you're not really part of this family, so you should know your place.\"\nHer words stung more than I cared to admit, but I refused to show it. Instead, I squared my shoulders and pulled out a chair, sitting down across from Dean without another word.\nJenny glanced at me, her eyes full of unspoken understanding. We were both walking a tightrope, pretending to tolerate Dean while working behind the scenes to take him down.\nAs I picked at my food, I couldn't help but steal glances at Dean. He looked calm, almost smug as if he had nothing to hide. It made my stomach churn. He was a murderer, sitting at this table as if he belonged, while Lia rotted in a dungeon for his crime.\nI clenched my fork tightly, resisting the urge to say something that might give us away. Alina's presence didn't make things easier. She was firmly in Dean's corner, blindly loyal to him despite everything. Confronting him now would be useless and dangerous.\nJenny nudged my foot under the table, breaking my train of thought. I glanced at her and caught the subtle raise of her eyebrow, a silent reminder to stay focused. We had a plan, and we needed to stick to it.\nI took a deep breath and forced myself to relax. Dean's arrogance would be his downfall, and I had no intention of tipping him off before the time was right.\nStill, as I sat there, pretending to eat, I couldn't shake the anger boiling inside me. Dean might think he was untouchable, but he was wrong. Luca, Jenny, and I were closing in, and it was only a matter of time before his lies unraveled.\nI glanced at Jenny again, and this time, she gave me a faint nod. It was a small gesture, but it was enough to remind me of what we were fighting for. Lia's freedom, Finn's justice, and the truth no matter the cost.\nDean might be sitting there now, acting like he had nothing to fear, but his days were numbered. And when the truth finally came out, he'd have nowhere to hide.\n160\nBenedicta's POV\nI poured Merlin another glass of orange juice as he bit into his toast. His small hands fumbled to balance the slice, and I couldn't help but smile. These quiet breakfasts with him had become my anchor amidst the storm that had engulfed our lives.\n\"Mom's taking too long to come back,\" Merlin said, his voice tinged with the innocence of a child.\nI hesitated, setting my cup down. \"She'll be back soon,\" I said softly, keeping my tone light. \"She just had to travel for something important. But she's coming back, Merlin. You'll see her soon.\"\nHe nodded reluctantly, his little face pensive as he focused on his plate. Watching him like this made my chest tighten. He deserved none of this chaos, none of the lies or danger that had seeped into our home. I wanted so badly to protect him from all of it, but the secrets we kept were growing heavier by the day.\nJust as I reached for my coffee, the doorbell rang. My body stiffened instantly. Who could it be this early in the morning? I glanced at Merlin, who looked just as curious.\n\"Stay here, okay? I'll check who it is,\" I said quickly, rising from the table.\nWalking toward the door, I took a calming breath before opening it. What I saw made my heart stop. A man stood there tall, broad-shouldered, with a cold, calculating gaze that sent shivers down my spine. He didn't belong here, and I knew instantly that this wasn't a casual visit.\n\"Who are you?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.\nHis lips curved into a humorless smile. \"I have a message from my boss,\" he said smoothly, ignoring my question.\nI instinctively turned slightly to glance at Merlin, who was craning his neck to see what was going on. My mind raced. Whatever this man wanted, I couldn't let Merlin get dragged into it.\n\"What does your boss want?\" I asked calmly, even though my heart was pounding in my chest.\nThe man held out a folded piece of paper. \"This is an address,\" he said. \"You need to be there with the boy at the time written on it. If you're late or don't show up, you'll never see Lia again.\"\nHis words hit me like a punch to the gut, but I kept my expression neutral. I couldn't afford to show weakness. \"Understood,\" I said, taking the paper from him.\nThe man's smile widened slightly as if he was enjoying the power he held in this moment. Then, without another word, he turned and walked away, disappearing down the street.\nThe second the door closed, I reached for my phone and called Luca. My hands trembled as I dialed his number, but I managed to keep my voice steady when he picked up.\n\"Luca,\" I said quickly, \"a man just came to the house. He said he had a message from his boss and handed me an address. He wants me to bring Merlin there at a specific time. He threatened Lia.\"\n\"I saw everything,\" Luca replied, his voice calm but firm. \"The security cameras caught it all. I'm already on my way.\"\nRelief flooded through me, but it was short-lived. The situation was far from over. \"Thank you,\" I said quietly before hanging up.\nI turned back toward the dining room, where Merlin was still sitting at the table, looking up at me with wide, curious eyes. \"Who was that?\" he asked, his tone innocent but laced with concern.\nI forced a smile, shoving the paper into my pocket. \"Just someone dropping off a message,\" I said casually, ruffling his hair as I walked past him.\n\"What kind of message?\" he pressed, his curiosity unrelenting.\n\"Nothing important,\" I said lightly, sitting back down at the table. \"Now, finish your breakfast. You have a busy day ahead, young man.\"\nMerlin gave me a skeptical look but eventually returned to his toast. I watched him quietly, my mind racing as I tried to piece everything together.\nThe man's visit was a clear warning. Whoever his boss was, they were escalating things, and Lia's life hung in the balance. But Luca was already on it, and I trusted him to handle the situation.\nFor now, I needed to focus on keeping Merlin calm and safe. As I sat there, sipping my now-cold coffee, I couldn't help but feel the weight of everything pressing down on me. Lia, Merlin, the lies we were all tangled in it was all spiraling out of control.\nBut no matter what, I wouldn't let fear take over. I'd protect Merlin with everything I had, and I'd fight for Lia's freedom. These people might think they could intimidate me, but they were wrong.\nThis wasn't over. Not by a long shot.\n___\nLuca's POV\nI had already sent a team to tail the man who had visited Benedicta's house. It was crucial not to lose him, especially after the threat he delivered to her. My instructions were clear follow his car, intercept him at a safe spot, and knock him out without drawing attention. There was no room for error.\nThe call from my team came just as I was nearing the safe house. \"We've got him, boss,\" one of them confirmed. \"He's unconscious, and we're heading to the designated location.\"\n\"Good,\" I replied curtly. \"Secure him there, and make sure no one knows what happened.\"\nMinutes later, I arrived at the location. The place was desolate, perfect for what I had planned. The man was already tied to a chair, slumped over, but breathing. My men stood guard, ensuring no interruptions.\nPulling out my phone, I called Jenny. Her voice came through after the second ring. \"Luca, what's going on?\"\n\"I've got an update,\" I said, pacing the dimly lit room. \"The man who threatened Benedicta has been captured. I'm sending you and Bianca a picture now.\"\nI snapped a quick photo of the unconscious man, his face bruised from the struggle. \"We're going to use him as leverage against Dean,\" I explained. \"The only way to free Lia is to set Dean up. We need Alina to see him for the monster he really is.\"\nJenny hesitated before replying, \"And how do you plan to do that?\"\n\"I'll blackmail Dean,\" I said firmly. \"This guy is our key. I'll make Dean think we've got information that could ruin him, and I'll bait him into meeting me. Once we're face-to-face, I'll provoke him. Dean's pride is his weakness he won't be able to stop himself from saying too much.\"\n\"And what if he doesn't take the bait?\" Bianca chimed in, having joined the call.\nI smirked. \"He will. He thinks he's untouchable, but he won't risk whatever he's hiding getting out.\"\nI paused, looking at the man tied to the chair. \"I'll also have cameras set up at the meeting point. If Dean admits to anything anything at all I'll send the footage to Alina anonymously. Once she sees the truth, Lia will be free.\"\nThere was a brief silence on the other end before Bianca spoke. \"It's risky, but it might work. Just be careful, Luca. Dean isn't the type to go down without a fight.\"\n\"I know,\" I replied, my voice hard. \"That's why I need you and Jenny to keep an eye on Alina. If this goes south, she might try to protect Dean, even if she knows the truth.\"\n\"We've got it covered,\" Jenny assured me.\nEnding the call, I turned back to the man. He was starting to stir, groaning softly as he regained consciousness. \"Wake him up,\" I ordered my men.\nOne of them splashed cold water on his face, jolting him fully awake. His eyes darted around the room in panic before landing on me.\n\"Who who are you?\" he stammered.\n\"Your worst nightmare if you don't cooperate,\" I said coldly, leaning in close. \"You delivered a message to Benedicta. Now you're going to deliver one for me.\"\nThe man's eyes widened, but I didn't give him a chance to respond. I took another photo of him, making sure his bound hands were visible, and sent it directly to Dean. Along with the picture, I typed out a message:\n\"Meet me at the address below. You know what happens if you don't.\"\nI included the location of an abandoned warehouse I'd scouted earlier. Dean wouldn't dare ignore this.\nAs I hit send, I felt a surge of anticipation. This was the moment that could turn everything around. Dean had been untouchable for too long, but his arrogance would be his downfall.\nTurning to my men, I gave them final instructions. \"Keep this guy alive, but don't let him out of your sight. If anything goes wrong, I'll need him as insurance.\"\nOne of them nodded. \"Understood, boss.\"\nI stepped outside to wait for Dean's response, the cool night air biting against my skin. The minutes dragged on, each one heavier than the last. Finally, my phone buzzed.\nThe message was brief but telling: \"I'm on my way.\"\nA grim smile spread across my face. Everything was falling into place. Now it was up to me to see it through.\nAs I leaned against the hood of my car, I couldn't help but think of Lia. She'd endured so much because of Dean's lies and manipulations. She didn't deserve this.\nI clenched my fists, determination hardening my resolve. Today wasn't just about setting her free it was about justice. Dean's reign of terror was coming to an end, and I'd make sure of it.\nFor Lia. For Benedicta. For everyone, Dean had ever hurt.\nAnd if he thought he could outsmart me, he was about to learn just how wrong he was.\n161\nDean's POV\nThe tension in the air was suffocating as I stormed into my room, slamming the door shut behind me. My mind was spinning, the weight of the picture Luca had sent me pressing heavily on my chest. How had things spiraled so far out of control? I didn't know what Luca thought he was doing, but whatever it was, it wasn't going to end well for him.\nI yanked open my closet, grabbed a crisp shirt, and threw it on, my movements sharp and deliberate. My hands trembled slightly, but I pushed the unease aside. I needed to focus. If Luca wanted to play games, I'd play. But I'd make sure he regretted it.\nJust as I fastened the last button on my shirt, there was a knock at the door. I froze for a second, letting out a frustrated sigh before opening it. Alina stood there, her arms crossed, her eyes narrowing at me.\n\"And where are you heading off to in such a rush?\" she asked, her voice carrying a note of suspicion.\n\"I need to get out for a bit,\" I said, keeping my tone neutral. \"Clear my head. Everything going on has been... a lot.\"\nHer eyes softened slightly, but I could still see the doubt lingering there. \"You're not planning anything reckless, are you? We need to stay united now more than ever.\"\nI forced a small, tired smile. \"Reckless? No. I just need some air, Alina. I'll be back soon.\"\nShe seemed to hesitate, her gaze searching my face for any sign of deceit, but I didn't flinch. Finally, she nodded, stepping aside. \"Fine. But don't take too long. There's still a lot to deal with.\"\n\"Of course,\" I murmured, brushing past her and heading for the car park.\nAs I approached my car, I spotted Bianca and Jenny standing near one of the other vehicles, deep in conversation. My steps faltered slightly, but I quickly composed myself and walked past them, hoping they wouldn't notice me.\n\"Dean!\" Bianca's voice called out, stopping me in my tracks.\nI turned slowly, my expression blank. \"What?\"\n\"Where are you off to?\" she asked, her tone sharp.\n\"Out,\" I said curtly, not in the mood for their interrogation.\nJenny stepped forward, her arms crossed. \"Out? Care to elaborate?\"\n\"No,\" I snapped, my patience thinning. \"It's none of your business.\"\nBianca raised an eyebrow, exchanging a look with Jenny. \"We're just curious. You've been acting... strange.\"\nI rolled my eyes. \"I don't owe you an explanation. Now, if you'll excuse me...\"\nWithout waiting for a response, I turned on my heel and climbed into my car, slamming the door shut. As I started the engine, I caught a glimpse of the two of them watching me, their expressions unreadable.\nThe drive to the location Luca had sent was tense, the silence in the car broken only by the hum of the engine. My grip on the steering wheel tightened as I replayed the events of the past few days in my mind. I couldn't let him get the upper hand. Whatever he thought he had on me, I'd make sure it wasn't enough.\nWhen I finally pulled up to the abandoned building, I parked the car and sat for a moment, my heart pounding. This wasn't how I'd envisioned things going. But if Luca wanted to confront me, then so be it.\nI pulled out my phone and dialed his number, the tension building with every ring.\n\"You're here,\" he said when he answered, his voice calm, almost taunting.\n\"Where are you?\" I demanded, my eyes scanning the building's exterior.\n\"Inside,\" he replied. \"Come in. Let's talk.\"\nHis words hung in the air as the line went dead. I shoved the phone into my pocket and stepped out of the car, taking a deep breath. Whatever game Luca was playing, he'd soon realize I wasn't one to back down.\n___\nLuca's POV\nI leaned back in the chair, my arms crossed as I stared at the door. The faint sound of footsteps echoed in the distance, growing louder with each step. My eyes narrowed, anticipation simmering beneath my calm exterior. Dean was finally here.\nThe door creaked open, and there he was his expression a mixture of anger and wariness. His gaze flicked around the room before landing on me.\n\"You've got some nerve,\" he said, walking closer. \"What the hell is this about, Luca? Why did you abduct my man?\"\nI smirked, rising slowly from the chair. \"Why did you send him to Benedicta's house?\"\nDean scoffed, his eyes narrowing. \"Merlin is my son. I have every right to want to see him.\"\n\"Your son?\" I repeated, my voice dripping with disbelief. \"You mean the child you conveniently ignored until now? Spare me the excuses, Dean. We both know this has nothing to do with Merlin and everything to do with your desperation to cover your tracks.\"\nDean stiffened, but his voice remained cold. \"What do you want, Luca? What's your endgame here?\"\nI stepped closer, keeping my gaze locked on his. \"It's simple. I'll let go of Lia. I'll even go far away and disappear from your life and everyone else's. But only on one condition.\"\nHe tilted his head, suspicion evident in his eyes. \"And what condition is that?\"\n\"You destroy the gun,\" I said, my voice steady. \"The same gun you used to kill Finn.\"\nThe mention of Finn's name made his face twitch, though he quickly masked his reaction. \"Why would I do that?\" he asked, his tone laced with skepticism. \"Why should I trust you?\"\nI reached into my pocket, pulled out my travel documents, and held them up for him to see. \"This is my visa to Puerto Rico. I boarded a flight three days after... everything. I've got nothing to lose, Dean. All I need is your agreement. Destroy the gun, and I'll leave peacefully. No more games, no more threats.\"\nHe stared at the documents for a moment, his expression unreadable. Then his gaze shifted back to me. \"And I'm supposed to just take your word for it?\"\nI chuckled, shaking my head. \"Dean, this isn't about trust. It's about survival. Do you want to keep Alina in the dark about who you really are? Fine. But as long as that gun exists, you're vulnerable. Destroy it, and I'm out of your hair for good.\"\nHe seemed to consider my words, his jaw tightening as he weighed his options. The room fell silent, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife.\nFinally, he exhaled sharply and nodded. \"Fine. We have a deal. But if you cross me, Luca-\"\nI raised a hand, cutting him off. \"Save your threats, Dean. I know exactly who I'm dealing with.\"\nHis eyes narrowed, but he didn't respond. I watched as the tension in his shoulders eased slightly, the smallest crack in his otherwise unshakable facade.\n\"Good,\" I said, slipping the documents back into my pocket. \"Then let's get this over with.\"\nFor the first time in years, it felt like I had the upper hand. But I knew better than to trust Dean entirely. This was just the beginning, and I was prepared for whatever came next.\n162\nDean's POV\nThe moon hung high in the sky as I led Luca through the winding path behind my property. The forest was eerily silent, save for the crunch of leaves under our feet. My heart pounded in my chest, but my face betrayed none of my inner turmoil. This was all part of the plan, and I wasn't about to let Luca suspect a thing.\nAfter a few minutes, I stopped abruptly. \"It's here,\" I said, pointing to a spot on the ground.\nLuca stood back, arms crossed, his piercing gaze fixed on me. I ignored him and picked up the shovel I'd brought along, plunging it into the earth. The damp soil gave way easily as I dug, my muscles straining with each movement. Minutes felt like hours as the hole grew deeper until finally, the edge of a metal box came into view.\nI pulled it out, brushing the dirt off the surface before unlocking it. Inside was a gun-clean, shiny, and deliberately placed. I held it up for Luca to see.\n\"Here it is,\" I said, my voice even.\nLuca's eyes narrowed as he stepped closer. \"This is the gun?\"\n\"This is the gun,\" I confirmed.\nWithout another word, I walked back to my car and retrieved a hammer from the trunk. Placing the gun on a flat rock nearby, I lifted the hammer high and brought it down with a resounding crack. The sound echoed through the forest as the gun's frame bent under the force. Strike after strike, I ensured the weapon was nothing more than a mangled mess of metal.\nLuca watched in silence, his expression unreadable. When I was done, I straightened and turned to him. \"Satisfied?\"\nHe tilted his head slightly. \"And what about the gun you used to frame Lia? Is this it?\"\nI met his gaze without flinching. \"This is the same gun. There's no other.\"\nFor a moment, he just stared at me, as if trying to decipher some hidden meaning in my words. Then, he gave a small nod. \"Good.\"\nWe walked back to our cars in silence. The tension was thick, but I kept my composure, knowing this encounter was far from over.\nAs I climbed into my car, I glanced in the rearview mirror, watching Luca drive off into the darkness. A slow smile crept onto my face, followed by a low chuckle that grew into full-blown laughter.\nHe actually believed it.\nI started the engine and took a long, winding route to a location only I knew. This was my sanctuary, my secret place where I kept things I couldn't afford to lose.\nThe hideout was small and unassuming, tucked away in a dense thicket of trees. I parked the car and walked inside, the weight of the evening's events finally lifting as I approached a hidden panel in the wall. Behind it was another safe.\nI entered the code with practiced ease, the lock clicking open to reveal the real prize: the gun.\nThe weapon gleamed under the dim light, its significance heavy in my hands. This was the gun that could destroy Lia's life-or save it, depending on how I chose to play my cards. I turned it over in my hands, a triumphant smile spreading across my face.\n\"Nice try, Luca,\" I murmured to myself, placing the gun back into the safe and securing it tightly.\nThe night was far from over, but for now, I allowed myself a moment of satisfaction. Luca thought he'd outsmarted me, but this game was mine to win.\nAs I stepped out of the hideout and locked the door behind me, the cool night air filled my lungs. I felt invincible, the weight of the evening's charade fading into the background.\nThis wasn't just a game of survival-it was a game of strategy, and I had just made my move.\n_____\nLuca's POV\nThe moment the call connected, Jenny's voice came through, steady but tinged with urgency.\n\"Did you get the video?\" I asked, gripping the steering wheel tightly as I navigated the dark streets.\n\"Yes, we did,\" Jenny confirmed. \"It's clear as day. He's digging something out of the ground. What's the next move?\"\nI glanced at the small tracker display on my dashboard, which showed Dean's location in real time. The chip I had planted on his coat was working flawlessly. \"Keep watching for any new movements. I have a feeling this isn't over yet. That bastard might think he's smart, but he doesn't know who he's messing with.\"\n\"Got it,\" Jenny replied before hanging up.\nAs I pulled up in front of Benedicta's house, I took a deep breath, centering myself. I had to get her and Merlin out of here immediately. Dean was unpredictable, and with the way things were escalating, there was no telling what he might do next.\nI stepped out of the car and walked briskly to the door. The tension in the air was palpable as Benedicta opened it, her eyes widening in surprise.\n\"Luca? What are you doing here?\"\n\"We need to go. Now,\" I said firmly, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation. \"Dean's getting desperate, and it's only a matter of time before he makes a move. You and Merlin need to be somewhere safe.\"\nBenedicta hesitated, glancing toward the living room where Merlin was playing with his toys. \"Is it that serious?\"\n\"It's worse than you think,\" I replied, lowering my voice. \"Dean knows we're close to exposing him. I can't risk him coming after either of you.\"\nShe nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. \"Give me a moment.\"\nMinutes later, Benedicta and Merlin were bundled up and ready to leave. I carried Merlin's bag while Benedicta held his hand tightly, her face etched with worry.\nOnce they were settled in my car, I drove straight to my house, my mind racing. As soon as we arrived, I ushered them inside and locked the doors behind us.\n\"Stay here,\" I instructed, pointing to the living room. \"I'll handle the rest.\"\nBenedicta nodded, sitting down with Merlin, who was too distracted by his surroundings to notice the tension.\nI went straight to my office and pulled up the live feed from the chip I had placed on Dean. The grainy footage showed him walking into what looked like a small, hidden structure. My gut twisted as I watched him retrieve another gun-a different one this time-from a secret compartment.\nI leaned back in my chair, a slow smile spreading across my face. \"Got you.\"\nBenedicta walked in quietly, her expression curious. \"What's happening?\"\nI pointed to the screen. \"He destroyed the wrong gun. But now we know where he's keeping the real one.\"\nRelief flickered across her face. \"So what's the plan?\"\nI picked up my phone and dialed a number. \"We're going to take it from him.\"\nWhen the call connected, I spoke quickly, giving my men the coordinates of the hideout. \"Get there quietly. Take the gun, but make sure no one sees you. I don't want Dean catching wind of this until it's too late.\"\nAfter hanging up, I leaned back in my chair, exhaling deeply. The pieces were finally falling into place.\nBenedicta sat down across from me, a small smile playing on her lips. \"You're really something, Luca. I don't know how you manage to stay two steps ahead.\"\nI smirked. \"It's not about being ahead. It's about knowing your opponent. Dean thinks he's clever, but his arrogance is his biggest weakness.\"\nShe nodded, looking more at ease. \"So, what happens now?\"\n\"Now,\" I said, standing up, \"we wait. Once we have the gun, it's game over for Dean.\"\nAs I walked back into the living room, I found Merlin curled up on the couch, fast asleep. Benedicta sat beside him, her expression softening as she stroked his hair.\n\"We'll be safe here,\" I assured her. \"Dean won't know what hit him.\"\nShe looked up at me, her eyes filled with gratitude. \"Thank you, Luca. For everything.\"\nI nodded, my resolve hardening. \"I'm not doing this just for Lia or Benedicta. I'm doing this for everyone Dean's hurt. And when the time comes, he'll have no one to blame but himself.\"\nAs the night stretched on, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. The tide was turning, and Dean's downfall was only a matter of time.\n163\nAlina's POV\nThe weight of responsibility bore down on me as I walked to my wardrobe and selected a long, formal gown in a deep shade of red. It was the color of power, of justice of finality. Today marked the end for Lia. Today, she would face judgment for her crime.\nOnce dressed, I tied my hair back in a sleek bun and slipped on a pair of black heels. My reflection in the mirror stared back at me, fierce and composed, but inside, I felt a twinge of uncertainty. Shaking it off, I grabbed my phone and left my chambers.\nThe dungeon was damp, the cold air biting against my skin as I walked down the dimly lit corridors. Lia sat in the far corner of her cell, her face pale but defiant. She didn't look like someone who was about to face her end.\n\"Get up,\" I ordered, unlocking the cell door. My voice was clipped and firm.\nLia stood slowly, her movements deliberate, as if mocking my authority. \"So, it's today,\" she said, her voice calm.\nI ignored her tone, grabbing her arm and pulling her out of the cell. \"Today marks your final day,\" I said coldly. \"The day you'll be judged and punished for killing Finn. And after that, you'll be gone from this earth.\"\nLia didn't respond, but I could feel her gaze burning into my back as I led her through the halls.\nThe grand hall was already bustling with activity. The elders sat in their designated seats, their faces solemn and expectant. Guards stood at attention along the walls, their eyes trained on me as I pushed Lia forward.\n\"Move,\" I snapped, shoving her toward the spot designated for her at the center of the room. Lia stumbled slightly but caught herself, her expression unreadable as she took her place.\nI walked up to my seat at the head of the table and sat down. Taking a deep breath, I addressed the room. \"Elders, we may begin.\"\nBefore anyone could speak, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I hesitated, glancing down at the screen. It was an anonymous message. A part of me wanted to ignore it-this was no time for distractions but something compelled me to check it.\nUnlocking my phone, I opened the message and saw a video file. My pulse quickened as I pressed play.\nThe footage was shaky but clear. It showed Luca and Dean standing together, talking in hushed tones. I turned up the volume, and their voices filled my ears:\n\"we destroy this gun, and it's over,\" Luca was saying.\nDean's reply was chillingly calm. \"Fine. But I don't trust you.\"\nI froze, my mind racing. What were they doing together? Why was Dean discussing a gun with Luca?\n\"Alina?\" one of the elders prompted, drawing my attention back to the room.\nI quickly locked my phone and forced a neutral expression. \"Halt the meeting,\" I said abruptly. \"I've just received an urgent message that requires my attention.\"\nThe elders exchanged confused glances but complied, leaning back in their chairs.\nAs they murmured among themselves, I replayed the video, this time plugging in my earphones to hear every word clearly. The conversation between Luca and Dean continued their tone tense but calculated.\nThe realization hit me like a thunderbolt. My thoughts flashed back to what Lia had said during her initial plea: \"What if I'm not the one responsible? What if the person is really close to you?\"\nCould it be true? Could Dean, my trusted partner, have something to do with Finn's death?\nMy heart pounded in my chest as the implications sank in. I needed time to process this.\n\"Guards,\" I called out, my voice steady but firm. \"Take Lia to a spare room and lock her in. She is to remain there until further notice.\"\nThe guards immediately moved to comply, grabbing Lia and escorting her out of the hall. Lia didn't resist, but as she passed me, she gave me a small, knowing smile that sent a chill down my spine.\nOnce she was gone, I stood up, my legs feeling unsteady beneath me. \"This meeting is adjourned,\" I announced, earning confused looks from the elders. \"I'll call for you again when I'm ready.\"\nWithout waiting for a response, I left the hall and retreated to my office, shutting the door behind me. The walls seemed to close in as I paced the room, the video replaying in my mind.\nPulling out my phone, I tried to trace the sender of the message, but it was no use. The number was untraceable, and the sender was anonymous. Frustration boiled within me, mixing with the nagging sense of betrayal.\nI couldn't ignore this. I needed answers, and there was only one person who could give them to me.\nTaking a deep breath, I dialed Dean's number. The phone rang twice before he picked up.\n\"Alina?\" His voice was calm, but I could detect a hint of surprise.\n\"There's something we need to discuss,\" I said, keeping my tone measured. \"It's important. Come to my office immediately.\"\nDean hesitated for a moment. \"I'll be there.\"\nAs I ended the call, I let out a shaky sigh. My hands trembled slightly as I placed the phone on my desk.\nWhatever was happening, I needed to get to the bottom of it. And if Dean was hiding something, I would find out.\n___\nJenny's POV\nI tapped my fingers on the table as I stared at my phone, the minutes ticking by agonizingly slow. I hoped Alina had received the anonymous video and would do the right thing to halt the meeting. That single video held the power to turn everything upside down.\nBianca was near the meeting area, which was perfect for getting updates. Without wasting time, I dialed her number. She picked up almost immediately.\n\"Bianca,\" I said quickly. \"What's happening? Has Alina stopped the meeting yet?\"\nThere was a pause before Bianca answered. \"She stopped it,\" she whispered. \"Lia's been taken to another room, and Alina went straight to her office. She looked rattled.\"\nA satisfied smile tugged at my lips. \"Good. That means she saw the video. Keep an eye out for any other developments.\"\n\"Will do,\" Bianca replied before hanging up.\nWithout missing a beat, I called Luca. He answered on the second ring.\n\"She stopped the meeting,\" I told him. \"Alina's in her office now. Bianca says she looked shaken, so she must've seen the video. I'll try to find out what's going on.\"\n\"Good,\" Luca said, his voice steady but tense. \"Let me know what you find out.\"\nI hung up and stood, smoothing down the front of my shirt. It was time to act. I walked confidently down the hall toward Alina's office.\nThe guards stationed outside gave me a brief glance but said nothing as I pushed open the door without knocking. Alina was pacing the room, her arms folded across her chest. She looked up sharply, her face a mix of frustration and unease.\n\"Jenny,\" she said flatly, stopping mid-step.\nI feigned concern, stepping inside and closing the door behind me. \"I heard the meeting was stopped. I thought Lia would've been punished by now. Honestly, I was hoping to see that happen.\"\nAlina's expression darkened, and she let out a sharp breath. \"I halted the meeting,\" she said curtly, \"and I'm waiting for Dean to arrive.\"\nHer words caught me off guard, but I quickly masked my surprise. \"Dean? Why?\"\nAlina didn't answer. Instead, she turned away, her gaze fixed on the window as though lost in thought.\nI pressed her again. \"Alina, what's going on? Why would you stop the meeting for Dean?\"\nStill, she said nothing, her silence only deepening my curiosity. Whatever was on her mind, it was clearly serious.\nI decided not to push further. \"Well,\" I said, injecting a hint of false cheer into my tone, \"I hope everything works out. But for what it's worth, I'd really love to see Lia punished. She deserves it.\"\nAlina didn't respond, and I took that as my cue to leave.\nAs soon as I was out of her office, a triumphant smile spread across my face. I headed straight to Bianca, who was waiting for me in the lounge.\n\"Well?\" Bianca asked, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.\nI leaned in close, lowering my voice. \"It's working,\" I said, my excitement barely contained. \"She stopped the meeting, and she's waiting for Dean. She didn't say why, but you could see the doubt all over her face.\"\nBianca's grin mirrored mine. \"Finally. She's starting to see the truth.\"\n\"Exactly,\" I said, crossing my arms. \"And once she confronts Dean, it'll all come crashing down for him. He's been walking around like he's untouchable, but not anymore.\"\nBianca nodded eagerly. \"Do you think she'll punish him immediately?\"\n\"She might,\" I said with a smirk. \"But even if she doesn't, she's already questioning him. That's all we need for now.\"\nI leaned back, savoring the moment. Everything was falling into place. Dean thought he could outsmart everyone, but his arrogance would be his downfall.\n\"We need to stay close,\" I added, my tone serious now. \"The moment Alina makes a move, we need to be ready.\"\nBianca nodded again, her expression determined. \"This is just the beginning.\"\nI smiled, satisfied. Dean wouldn't see it coming. And when the truth was finally out, he'd have no one to blame but himself.\n164\nLuca's POV\nThe sound of tires crunching gravel outside brought a wave of relief over me. My guys were back, and I had no doubt they'd completed the task. I walked to the window, watching as they stepped out of the van, one of them holding a small, padded case. A sense of accomplishment filled me.\nI opened the door before they even knocked, motioning for them to come in. The leader of the group, Matteo, handed me the case. \"It's done,\" he said simply, his tone firm but respectful.\n\"Good,\" I replied, opening the case to inspect the contents. There it was-the gun Dean had so desperately tried to keep hidden. Its weight in my hand felt like the weight of victory.\nMatteo leaned closer. \"What's next, boss?\"\nI placed the gun carefully on the table and turned to face him and the others. \"Now we wait. Dean doesn't know we've got the real weapon. For now, I want you all to lay low. No sudden movements. If Dean catches even a whiff of what we're up to, he'll disappear, and we can't afford that.\"\nThey nodded in unison, and I dismissed them. Alone again, I picked up my phone and dialed Jenny.\nShe answered on the first ring. \"Luca, what's going on?\"\n\"It's done,\" I said, pacing the room. \"We've got the gun. Now I need you to focus on Dean. Keep an eye on him, follow his movements, and report everything back to me. He's bound to slip up now that we've rattled him.\"\n\"Consider it done,\" Jenny said confidently. \"But there's something else. I've found out where they're keeping Lia.\"\nThat got my full attention. I stopped pacing, gripping the phone tightly. \"Where?\"\n\"She's locked in a spare room in the west wing,\" Jenny said. \"Alina had her moved there after she saw the video. She's stalling for now, but it won't be long before Dean gets involved.\"\nI let out a slow breath, processing the information. \"Good work. Keep your distance for now, but don't let her out of your sight. I'll handle the rest.\"\nJenny hesitated for a moment. \"Do you really think we can get her out before Dean makes his next move?\"\n\"We don't have a choice,\" I said firmly. \"Lia has been vindicated. She doesn't deserve to stay locked up another minute. Dean's days of manipulating everyone around him are over.\"\nJenny agreed and hung up. I stood there for a moment, formulating the next steps.\nI grabbed a notepad and began sketching out a rough plan. Getting Lia out wouldn't be easy. The west wing was heavily guarded, and with tensions running high, any misstep could result in disaster. I needed to be smart, to anticipate every possible obstacle.\nThe first step was to secure a distraction. If Dean or Alina were occupied elsewhere, it would give me the window I needed. I jotted down a few ideas, knowing I'd need Jenny and Bianca's help to pull it off.\nThe second step was the extraction itself. Lia was likely under lock and key, so I'd need someone on the inside to disable the security system. Matteo's team could handle that. They'd proven themselves capable tonight, and I trusted them to get the job done.\nFinally, there was the escape route. Once Lia was out, I couldn't bring her back here-it would be the first place Dean would look. I'd already scouted a safe house outside the city, hidden and secure. It would be the perfect place to lay low until the dust settled.\nAs the plan started coming together, a sense of determination took hold. Lia had suffered enough. She'd been dragged through the mud, accused of a crime she didn't commit, all because of Dean's lies. Now that I had the evidence to expose him, it was time to put an end to this.\nI picked up the gun from the table, studying it closely. This small piece of metal held the power to change everything. With it, I could not only prove Lia's innocence but also take Dean down once and for all.\nMy phone buzzed with a message from Jenny: Dean just arrived at Alina's office. Looks tense.\nI smiled to myself. Let them talk. Let them dig their own graves. Meanwhile, I'd be working in the shadows, putting the final pieces of the puzzle together.\nI called Matteo again. \"We've got another mission,\" I said. \"Get the team ready. This one's delicate, but it's the most important one yet.\"\n\"Yes, boss,\" he replied without hesitation.\nI ended the call and leaned back in my chair, my mind racing. Tomorrow, we'd set the plan in motion. Lia would finally be free, and Dean would face the consequences of his actions.\nFor the first time in a long while, I felt like we were one step ahead.\n___\nAlina's POV\nThe moment Dean walked into my office, I couldn't keep the anger from boiling over. I stood from my chair, glaring at him as he casually shut the door behind him. \"Where the hell have you been?\" I demanded, my voice sharper than intended.\nHe raised his hands in mock surrender, his face an unreadable mask. \"I've been handling a few things. What's the problem now?\"\n\"Handling things?\" I scoffed. \"What exactly were you handling, Dean? Because I've been getting some very interesting messages.\"\nHis expression faltered, a flicker of unease crossing his features. Before he could utter a word, I picked up my phone and shoved it in his face, showing him the video of him and Luca together. His jaw tightened, and for a moment, I thought he might deny everything.\n\"Explain this!\" I yelled, throwing the phone onto the desk in front of him.\nDean hesitated, his gaze shifting between me and the video. \"It's not what it looks like,\" he said finally, his voice calm but calculated.\n\"Not what it looks like?\" I repeated, my fury mounting. \"You're meeting with Luca, Dean! The same man who's been working against us! What are you hiding?\"\nHe opened his mouth to respond, but before he could, my phone buzzed again. I glanced at the screen and froze. Another video had come in this time, with audio.\nMy heart raced as I clicked play. Dean moved closer, trying to get a look, but I turned away, refusing to let him touch the phone. I plugged in my earphones, pressing them in tightly, and the office fell silent save for the sound of the video playing in my ears.\nAs I listened, my blood ran cold. The voices were unmistakable-Dean and Luca, discussing Merlin, Lia, and the gun. Every word they exchanged unraveled another thread of the lies I'd been fed.\nI yanked the earphones out and played the video aloud, my hand trembling as I held up the phone.\nDean's face went pale. \"Alina, listen-\"\n\"Don't you dare!\" I snapped, stepping back as the realization hit me like a freight train. \"You lied to me! You've been lying to me this entire time! Everything Lia said-it was true, wasn't it?\"\nHis hand twitched, and before I could react, he pulled a silver blade from his pocket, pointing it at me with a dangerous gleam in his eyes.\nI stumbled back, the shock paralyzing me. \"Dean...what are you doing?\"\n\"Sit down, Alina,\" he commanded, his voice icy and devoid of emotion.\n\"You're really like this?\" I whispered, my voice barely audible as I pieced it all together. The manipulation, the deceit, the lengths he'd gone to protect himself-it all made sense now.\n\"Sit down,\" he repeated, this time with more force.\nWith no other choice, I sank into the chair, my mind racing. He approached me slowly, pulling a length of rope from his pocket.\n\"Dean, please, we can talk about this,\" I pleaded, trying to buy time.\n\"There's nothing to talk about,\" he said coldly, tying my hands firmly behind the chair. \"You shouldn't have gotten involved, Alina. You should've just trusted me.\"\n\"Trusted you?\" I hissed, my anger reigniting despite my fear. \"After everything you've done? You're a monster!\"\nHe finished tying the rope and leaned down, his face inches from mine. \"You think I'm the monster?\" he said with a bitter laugh. \"You have no idea what I've been through to get here. But don't worry-you'll understand soon enough.\"\nHe straightened and walked to the door, pausing with his hand on the knob. \"Don't scream,\" he warned, glancing back at me. \"It won't help you.\"\nWith that, he slipped out of the office, leaving me bound and seething. As the door clicked shut, I let out a shaky breath, the weight of the situation crashing down on me.\nDean was a liar, a manipulator, and now a threat to everyone around him. For the first time, I realized just how deep h\nis betrayal ran and how far he was willing to go to protect himself.\nBut this wasn't over. Not by a long shot.\n165\nJenny's POV\nBianca and I stood just outside Alina's office door, our ears straining for any hint of what was happening inside. The confrontation we'd witnessed through the small crack in the door had left us both on edge. Dean had tied Alina up and left her helpless, and now we were ready to stop him before he could cause more harm.\nThe door suddenly swung open, and Dean emerged, his expression a mix of panic and determination. He froze for a split second upon seeing us, then scowled.\n\"Where are you off to in such a rush?\" I asked, stepping into his path.\nBianca crossed her arms, blocking his escape in the other direction.\n\"Out of my way,\" Dean growled, his voice low and threatening. \"I don't have time for this.\"\n\"Funny,\" Bianca said, her tone sharp. \"You didn't seem to have time for anything else when you were tying up Alina a few minutes ago.\"\nDean's face darkened, and he took a step forward, clearly ready to force his way through. But before he could make a move, the pack sentinels appeared, emerging from the hallway.\n\"Dean,\" one of them said, his tone commanding, \"you're not going anywhere.\"\nDean's eyes darted around, his jaw clenching as he realized he was cornered. \"You don't know what you're doing,\" he snapped, trying to push past the nearest sentinel.\nThe sentinel grabbed his arm and yanked him back, pinning him against the wall. Another joined in, ensuring he couldn't move.\n\"This is a mistake!\" Dean shouted, struggling against their grip.\n\"Save it,\" I said, stepping closer to him. \"We've seen enough to know exactly who you are. You're done, Dean.\"\nI hurried into Alina's office, my heart pounding as I spotted her tied to the chair. Her face was pale, her expression a mix of anger and disbelief.\n\"Alina!\" I rushed over, quickly untying the ropes around her wrists. She winced as I freed her, rubbing her arms.\n\"Thank you,\" she said breathlessly, standing on shaky legs.\nBianca entered the room, glancing over her shoulder. \"The sentinels have him secured. What should we do next?\"\nAlina straightened, her determination shining through the anger in her eyes. \"We take him to the dungeon. He doesn't deserve to be anywhere else.\"\nWith that, the three of us made our way to the dungeon, where the sentinels had already dragged Dean. He was inside a cold, dark cell, pacing like a caged animal. When he saw us, his eyes narrowed, and he slammed a fist against the bars.\n\"You don't know what you're doing!\" he snarled. \"This isn't over!\"\n\"Oh, it's over,\" Alina said, her voice icy. \"Your judgment is coming very soon, and you'll pay for everything you've done.\"\nDean laughed bitterly. \"You think you can stop me? You think you're in control? You have no idea what's coming.\"\n\"Save your threats,\" Bianca snapped, her tone matching Alina's. \"No one's afraid of you anymore.\"\nI pulled out my phone and quickly called Luca. The line barely rang before he picked up.\n\"What's going on?\" Luca asked, his voice tense.\n\"It's done,\" I told him. \"Dean's in the dungeon. He's been exposed, and Alina's safe. But you need to get here. Things are escalating fast.\"\n\"I'm on my way,\" Luca said. \"Keep an eye on him. Don't let him out of your sight.\"\nI ended the call and turned back to the cell. Dean was sitting on the bench inside, his hands clasped as he glared at us.\n\"Luca's coming,\" I informed Alina. \"We'll get to the bottom of this soon.\"\nAlina nodded, though her gaze remained fixed on Dean. \"He won't get away with this,\" she said firmly. \"Not this time.\"\nBianca placed a hand on her shoulder, offering silent support. I knew this was far from over, but for now, we had the upper hand. Dean's reign of deceit and manipulation was crumbling, and soon, justice would be served.\n___\nLia's POV\nI sat in the corner of the cold, damp dungeon, my back pressed against the rough stone wall. My wrists ached from the heavy chains, but the pain in my heart was far worse. I had been accused of something I hadn't done, and no matter how hard I tried to convince them, no one believed me.\nThe door creaked open suddenly, and I flinched at the sound of approaching footsteps. The light from the hallway spilled into the dark room, and I squinted, trying to make out who it was. My breath hitched when I saw Alina, followed closely by Jenny and Bianca.\nI scrambled to my feet, unsure of what to expect. Were they here to finally pass judgment?\n\"Lia,\" Alina's voice broke through the silence, softer than I'd ever heard it before.\n\"What is this?\" I asked warily, my voice hoarse from lack of use.\nJenny and Bianca stepped forward, unlocking the chains around my wrists. The weight fell away, and I rubbed the sore spots, still watching them with suspicion.\n\"We're here to take you out of this place,\" Bianca said, her tone gentle.\nI blinked in disbelief. \"What?\"\n\"We've exposed Dean,\" Jenny explained, her eyes meeting mine. \"Alina knows the truth now. Dean's been manipulating everything from the start. He's in the dungeon now, waiting for judgment.\"\nThe words took a moment to sink in. I stared at them, searching for any sign of deceit, but all I saw was sincerity.\n\"Is this real?\" I whispered, my voice shaking.\nAlina stepped closer, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. \"Lia, I owe you an apology. A deep, heartfelt apology. I should have believed you. I should have listened to you instead of letting my anger cloud my judgment. I'm so sorry for everything I put you through.\"\nHer words hit me like a tidal wave, and for a moment, I couldn't speak. The weight of her apology, combined with the revelation that my nightmare was finally over, overwhelmed me.\nJenny and Bianca looked at me with matching expressions of remorse.\n\"We're sorry too,\" Jenny said softly. \"We should have done more. We should have questioned things. Please forgive us.\"\nI felt tears welling up in my eyes, and before I could stop myself, I was nodding. \"I I forgive you,\" I managed to say.\nAlina stepped forward and wrapped her arms around me. For a moment, I froze, unsure of how to react. But then the warmth of her embrace melted my hesitation, and I hugged her back tightly.\nJenny and Bianca joined in, and the four of us stood there in a circle, united in a way I hadn't thought possible just hours ago.\nJust as we stepped back, the sound of footsteps echoed from the hallway. We all turned to see Luca walking in, his expression a mixture of relief and determination.\n\"Luca,\" I breathed, my heart skipping a beat.\nHe strode toward us, his gaze locked on mine. Alina glanced at Jenny and Bianca, and without a word, they nodded and began to walk out of the dungeon.\n\"We'll give you two some privacy,\" Alina said softly before disappearing through the door.\nThe silence that followed felt heavy but not uncomfortable. Luca came closer, and I could see the worry etched into his features.\n\"I'm so sorry for everything,\" he said, his voice low. \"I should have done more to protect you. I should have been there.\"\nI shook my head, tears streaming down my face. \"You did what you could. You believed me when no one else did. That's all that matters.\"\nHe reached out and cupped my face, his thumb brushing away a tear. \"I promise you, Lia, no one will ever hurt you again. Not Dean, not anyone.\"\nFor the first time in what felt like forever, I allowed myself to feel a glimmer of hope. Luca had always been my anchor, and now, with Dean's lies unraveling, I felt like I could finally breathe again.\n\"Thank you,\" I whispered, leaning into his touch.\nLuca's lips curved into a small smile. \"You don't need to thank me. You deserve justice, and I'll make sure you get it.\"\nWe stood there in silence for a while, the tension and fear of the past few weeks slowly melting away. For the first time, I felt safe. I felt like I wasn't alo\nI'm not in this fight anymore.\nAnd as I looked into Luca's eyes, I knew that no matter what happened next, we'd face it together.\n166\nAlina's POV\nThe hall was silent, the air heavy with tension as I sat at the head of the long table, my eyes locked on Dean. He stood before us, restrained by the pack sentinels, his once-confident demeanor reduced to a pale, trembling shadow of the man he used to be. He had no more lies to spin, no more manipulations to hide behind.\nThe elders murmured amongst themselves, their voices a low hum in the background. I kept my gaze fixed on Dean, my emotions a whirlwind of anger, regret, and determination. This was justice-not just for Finn, but for Lia, for the pack, and for myself.\n\"Dean,\" I began, my voice steady and commanding, \"your actions have brought nothing but pain and destruction to this pack. You murdered Finn, framed Lia, and deceived me at every turn. Your betrayal runs deep, and for that, you must face the consequences of your actions.\"\nHe opened his mouth, perhaps to beg for mercy or spin another excuse, but I raised a hand to silence him. I couldn't hear another word from him.\n\"The council has deliberated,\" I continued, \"and the sentence is death by hanging.\"\nGasps filled the room, but I remained unmoved. This wasn't a decision I made lightly, but it was necessary. Dean had not only betrayed me but also threatened the very fabric of our pack. He couldn't be allowed to harm anyone else.\nDean's face crumbled, and for a brief moment, I saw the man I once trusted, the man who had been part of my inner circle. But that man was gone, replaced by a monster who had betrayed us all.\nThe sentinels dragged him out of the hall, his protests echoing faintly down the corridor. I took a deep breath, steadying myself as I turned to the pack.\n\"With Dean's judgment passed, it's time for us to heal,\" I said, my voice soft but resolute. \"And I believe the best way to do that is by placing the clan in the hands of someone who has proven their strength, loyalty, and resilience.\"\nThe murmurs started again, this time filled with curiosity and surprise.\n\"I'm stepping down as Alpha,\" I announced, feeling the weight of my words. \"Lia will take my place.\"\nLia, standing in the back of the room, froze in shock. Her eyes widened as she processed my words.\n\"You've shown incredible courage, Lia,\" I continued, looking directly at her. \"You've endured more than anyone should, and you've come out stronger. The pack needs someone like you-someone with a heart that can lead them into a better future.\"\n\"But Alina,\" she started, her voice shaky, \"you're the Alpha. This is your pack.\"\nI smiled, a bittersweet feeling settling in my chest. \"It's time for me to find my own path, Lia. I've been the Alpha for years, and I've lost myself along the way. I need to step back, to rediscover who I am. The pack will be in good hands with you.\"\nThe room erupted into applause, and I saw Lia's hesitant smile turn into one of pride and acceptance. I knew she would do great things, and Luca would be there to support her.\n\\---\nThe engagement party was a vibrant celebration, the hall decorated with lights and flowers as the pack gathered to honor Lia and Luca's union. I watched from the sidelines, a sense of peace washing over me. Lia and Luca deserved this moment of happiness after everything they'd been through.\nAs the night wore on, Jenny and Bianca found me sitting by myself.\n\"You're really going through with this?\" Bianca asked her tone a mix of sadness and understanding.\nI nodded. \"It's time for me to go. I need to figure out who I am without the weight of the Alpha title.\"\nJenny placed a hand on my shoulder. \"We're going to miss you, Alina. But we understand.\"\n\\---\nThe next morning, Jenny and Bianca accompanied me to the airport. The three of us stood near the gate, a mix of emotions swirling between us.\n\"You're sure about this?\" Bianca asked, her voice soft.\nI nodded a small smile on my lips. \"It's not goodbye forever. Just for now. Lia and Luca will lead the pack well. It's their time.\"\nJenny hugged me tightly, her voice breaking as she said, \"Take care of yourself, Alina. And don't forget to call.\"\nI laughed lightly, the sound bittersweet. \"I won't.\"\nAs the final boarding call echoed through the terminal, I turned to them one last time. \"Thank you for everything. I'll see you again, someday.\"\nWith one last wave, I walked toward the gate, my heart heavy but hopeful. For the first time in years, I was free to explore who I was, to find peace beyond the pack. And as I stepped onto the plane, I knew I was leaving them in capable hands. Lia would lead them into a brighter future, and I would finally be able to carve out a new path for myself.\n___\nLia's POV\nThe evening sunlight filtered through the wide windows of the dining hall, casting a golden glow over the room. I stood by the table, arranging the final touches for dinner. A nervous excitement buzzed through me as I awaited Benedicta and Merlin's arrival. It wasn't every day I hosted someone who had played such a pivotal role in Luca's life-and now, indirectly, in mine.\nA knock at the door pulled me from my thoughts. I wiped my hands on a towel and hurried to answer. Standing there were Benedicta and Merlin, smiles lighting their faces. Merlin clung to Benedicta's hand, his innocent gaze wandering curiously around the hall.\n\"Lia,\" Benedicta greeted warmly, leaning in for a hug. \"Thank you for inviting us.\"\n\"Of course,\" I replied, my voice genuine. \"It's about time we all sat down for a meal together.\"\nI crouched down to Merlin's level, offering him a warm smile. \"Hi, Merlin. It's so nice to finally meet you.\"\nHe smiled shyly, hiding partially behind Benedicta. \"Hi.\"\nLuca appeared behind me, his presence a steadying comfort. \"Come in, both of you. Dinner's ready, and Lia's been working hard to make it perfect.\"\n\\---\nThe dining table was set with dishes ranging from roasted vegetables to Luca's favorite lamb stew. Conversation flowed easily, with Benedicta sharing stories about Merlin's mischievous antics and Luca recounting some of his childhood memories.\nMerlin had warmed up quickly, his laughter filling the room as Luca playfully teased him about finishing his greens. I watched them interact, my heart swelling with affection. Seeing Luca like this-kind, attentive, and playful-was a side of him I cherished deeply.\nAfter dinner, we moved to the living room, where Merlin busied himself with a puzzle Benedicta had brought along. Benedicta leaned back in her chair, her gaze warm and thoughtful as she looked at me.\n\"Lia,\" she began, her tone sincere, \"thank you for opening your home to us. Merlin has been through so much, and I can already see how much he feels at ease here. I know you'll make an amazing stepmother to him.\"\nHer words caught me off guard, and a lump formed in my throat. I glanced at Merlin, who was focused on his puzzle, and then at Luca, who gave me an encouraging smile.\n\"It's my pleasure,\" I said softly, my voice thick with emotion. \"He's a wonderful boy, and I'm happy to have him here.\"\nBenedicta smiled, placing a gentle hand on mine. \"I'll be heading back soon, but Merlin will stay with you. I trust you and Luca to take care of him.\"\nHer words were a gift, one that carried the weight of trust and responsibility. I nodded, grateful for the chance to be a part of Merlin's life.\n\\---\nLater that evening, as Benedicta prepared to leave, Luca stood beside her at the door. I was helping Merlin settle into the guest room when I overheard their conversation.\n\"Benedicta,\" Luca said, his tone tinged with excitement, \"I wanted to tell you something. Lia and I are getting married in two weeks.\"\nI froze for a moment, my heart skipping a beat. I knew the wedding was imminent, but hearing it spoken out loud made it feel so much more real.\nBenedicta's delighted laugh followed. \"That's wonderful news, Luca! I couldn't be happier for both of you. Merlin will be thrilled, too.\"\nWhen I returned to the living room, Benedicta hugged me tightly, her eyes shining with happiness. \"Congratulations, Lia. I can't wait to see you as a bride.\"\n\"Thank you,\" I whispered, overwhelmed by her warmth and sincerity.\nAfter Benedicta left, Luca found me standing by the window, gazing out into the night. He wrapped his arms around me, resting his chin on my shoulder.\n\"You okay?\" he asked softly.\nI nodded, leaning into his embrace. \"Just thinking about everything. It feels like life is finally falling into place.\"\nHe pressed a kiss to my temple. \"It is. And I can't wait to spend the rest of it with you.\"\n\\---\nThe days that followed were filled with preparations for the wedding. Merlin settled into his new routine quickly, his laughter bringing life to the house. Luca and I worked together to create a home that felt warm and welcoming, not just for ourselves but for Merlin, too.\nEvery now and then, I'd catch Merlin humming to himself as he played, his face lit with a smile that made my heart swell. It was in those moments I realized just how much our lives were intertwining, becoming a family in every sense of the word.\nAs the wedding drew closer, the anticipation grew, not just for the ceremony but for the life we were building together. And for the first time in a long time, I felt at peace, surrounded by love, trust, and the promise of a brighter future.\n167\nLuca's POV\nThe day had finally arrived. The day I had waited for, dreamed of and worked tirelessly to see come to fruition. My wedding day. As I stood at the altar in the grand cathedral, sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, casting a kaleidoscope of colors onto the marble floor. The air was heavy with the scent of roses and lavender, a symbol of unity for our clans.\nGuests from both sides filled the pews, their once-hostile gazes now softened by the promise of peace. Today wasn't just about Lia and me-it was about forging a bond that would unite two warring clans into one.\nAnd then, the doors opened, and there she was.\nLia. My bride. My queen.\nShe walked down the aisle with a grace that stole my breath. Her gown was exquisite, flowing like liquid light, and her eyes were locked on mine. At that moment, the world narrowed to just the two of us.\nWhen she reached me, I took her hands in mine, unable to suppress the smile tugging at my lips. \"You're breathtaking,\" I whispered.\n\"And you're mine,\" she replied, her voice steady despite the emotion glistening in her eyes.\nThe ceremony passed in a blur of vows, rings, and applause. When the officiant pronounced us husband and wife, I didn't hesitate. I pulled Lia into my arms and kissed her deeply, sealing our union amidst the cheers of our clans.\n\\---\nThe After Party\nThe reception was a grand affair, held in the sprawling gardens of my family estate. The moon hung high, casting a silver glow over the festivities. Guests mingled, laughter and music filling the air as the two clans celebrated together for the first time in history.\nOur first dance as husband and wife was nothing short of magical. The band played a soft melody, and Lia melted into my arms as we swayed under the stars. Her laughter was contagious, her joy radiating to everyone around us.\nAs the night went on, alliances were formed over shared toasts, and old grievances were set aside. The once-impossible dream of unity was now a reality, and it was all because of Lia.\nMerlin, ever the charmer, stole Lia away for a dance, and I watched with a smile as she twirled the little boy around. He had come to mean so much to both of us, a symbol of the family we were building together.\n\\---\nLove Making\nWhen the festivities wound down, Lia and I retreated to our private suite. The moment the door closed, the air shifted, charged with anticipation.\nShe turned to me, her eyes dark with desire. \"Finally,\" she murmured, her voice low and teasing.\nI crossed the distance between us, my hands finding her waist as I pulled her close. Her lips met mine in a kiss that was both tender and hungry, a mix of love and passion that left me breathless.\n\"Do you have any idea how much I love you?\" I whispered against her lips, my hands trailing down to the delicate buttons of her gown.\n\"Show me,\" she replied, her voice trembling with emotion.\nI undressed her slowly, savoring every moment as her gown pooled at her feet. She was stunning, her beauty illuminated by the soft glow of candlelight.\n\"You're perfect,\" I said, my voice filled with reverence.\n\"And you're overdressed,\" she teased, her fingers working to remove my jacket and shirt.\nWhen we were finally bare before each other, I guided her to the bed, our connection deepening with every touch and kiss. Our bodies moved together, a symphony of love and need, every sigh and whispered promise binding us closer.\nAs we reached the peak of our passion, I held her tightly, overwhelmed by the depth of my feelings. Lia was my everything-my partner, my queen, my forever.\n\\---\nJoining Both Clans Together\nThe morning after our wedding, we stood before the leaders of both clans, the weight of history pressing down on us. Lia stood beside me, her presence commanding yet warm.\n\"It's time to move forward,\" I began, my voice steady. \"For too long, our clans have been divided by conflict. Today, we stand united-not just by marriage, but by a shared vision for the future.\"\nLia stepped forward, her voice strong. \"This isn't just about Luca and me. It's about all of us. Together, we can build a legacy of peace, strength, and prosperity.\"\nApplause erupted, the sound echoing through the hall as one by one, the leaders came forward to pledge their support for the alliance.\nLater, as Lia and I walked through the gardens, hand in hand, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. We had done the impossible-united two clans and created a foundation for a better future.\nThat night, as we lay together, I held her close, my heart full of gratitude and love. \"We did it,\" I whispered, pressing a kiss to her temple.\nShe smiled, her fingers tracing patterns on my chest. \"No, Luca. This is just the beginning.\"\nAnd she was right. Together, there was nothing we couldn't achieve.\n___\nLia's POV\nThe plane hummed softly beneath us as Merlin sat between Luca and me, his excitement infectious. He kept pointing out the window, marveling at the clouds and the world below. Luca leaned in, answering every question with patience and amusement, his deep voice warm and soothing.\nI couldn't help but smile at the sight of them together. Merlin had brought so much light into our lives, and this vacation was a chance to bond as a family before the whirlwind of duties claimed us again.\nJenny and Bianca had insisted we take this trip. \"You two need it,\" Bianca had said, her hand resting comfortably on her boyfriend's shoulder. The deputy of the police department, Zachary, had been nothing but supportive, a rock for Bianca as she navigated her new leadership role. Seeing her happy was a relief-she deserved this after everything we'd been through.\nJenny, on the other hand, had rolled her eyes. \"Go on, Lia. Leave everything to us. Bianca's busy with her deputy, but I'll keep the clan running. Maybe I'll even find some excitement while you're away. Who knows, I might even find love.\" She laughed, but there was a hint of longing in her eyes.\n\"You will,\" I'd told her, hugging her tightly before we left. \"If anyone deserves it, it's you.\"\n\\---\nOur destination was a secluded island resort, chosen for its privacy and beauty. The moment we arrived, I felt the tension of the past few weeks melt away. The white sand stretched out before us, meeting crystal-clear water that sparkled under the sun.\nMerlin immediately ran toward the waves, laughing as the water lapped at his feet. Luca and I followed hand in hand, the breeze tugging at our hair.\n\"This was a good idea,\" Luca murmured, his voice low.\nI leaned into him, letting the warmth of his presence envelop me. \"It was.\"\nWe spent the next few days exploring the island, indulging in its beauty and tranquility. Merlin's laughter echoed as we built sandcastles, chased crabs, and swam in the calm waters. At night, we sat around a small bonfire, sharing stories and basking in the glow of family.\n\\---\nIt was during one of these quiet evenings that I began to suspect something. I'd felt a strange fluttering in my stomach earlier that day, and a wave of dizziness had hit me out of nowhere.\nLuca noticed immediately. \"Are you okay?\" he asked, his brow furrowed with concern.\nI waved it off with a laugh. \"Probably just too much sun.\"\nBut as the days passed, the symptoms became more pronounced-fatigue, nausea, and a craving for citrus that had me stealing every orange on the island. It wasn't long before the realization hit me like a wave.\nI was pregnant.\nThe thought sent a rush of joy through me. Merlin would have a sibling. Luca and I would have another child to love, to cherish, to call our own.\n\\---\nI waited until we were alone to tell Luca. We were walking along the shore at sunset, the sky painted in hues of orange and pink.\n\"Luca,\" I began, stopping to face him.\nHe turned to me, his expression soft and attentive. \"What is it?\"\nI took his hands, placing them gently on my stomach. \"We're having a baby.\"\nFor a moment, he just stared at me, his eyes wide with disbelief. Then, his face broke into the most radiant smile I'd ever seen.\n\"A baby?\" he repeated, his voice filled with wonder.\nI nodded, tears springing to my eyes as he pulled me into his arms. \"A baby,\" I confirmed.\nHe pressed a kiss to my forehead, his hands never leaving my stomach. \"You've made me the happiest man alive, Lia.\"\nWe stood there for a long time, the waves lapping at our feet, the stars beginning to twinkle above us. It was a moment I would treasure forever.\n\\---\nThe next day, we told Merlin. His reaction was priceless.\n\"I'm going to be a big brother?\" he asked, his eyes wide with excitement.\n\"Yes, you are,\" I said, laughing as he danced around the room.\n\"Can it be a little brother?\" he asked, tilting his head in thought.\n\"We'll see,\" Luca said, ruffling his hair.\nMerlin beamed. \"I'll teach him everything I know!\"\n\\---\nAs our vacation came to an end, I found myself feeling both excited and at peace. Our family was growing, and our future was brighter than ever.\nBefore we left the island, I sent a message to Jenny and Bianca, letting them know the good news. Bianca responded with a string of exclamation points, while Jenny replied with a simple, \"Told you everything would work out.\"\nBack home, there would be challenges, responsibilities, and the ever-present weight of leadership. But for now, I was content.\nI had Luca. I had Merlin. And soon, I would have another little one to hold in my arms.\nLife was perfect.\n168\nEpilogue\nLia's POV\nThe early morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow across the room. The gentle hum of the ocean waves outside was a constant reminder of how much life had changed over the past five years. I stretched lazily in bed, glancing over to see Luca already awake, leaning against the headboard with a book in his hands.\n\"You're up early,\" I murmured, snuggling closer to him.\nHe looked down at me, his lips curling into a smile. \"Couldn't sleep. Thought I'd make the most of the quiet before the chaos begins.\"\nI laughed softly. Chaos was an understatement when it came to our house these days. With two young boys and a girl who had inherited her father's stubbornness, mornings were anything but quiet.\nJust as I predicted, the door burst open, and Merlin ran in, followed closely by his siblings.\n\"Mom! Dad! You promised we'd go riding today!\" Merlin, now ten, was the leader of their little trio, his energy boundless.\n\"Yeah, you promised!\" echoed four-year-old Finn, his bright eyes shining with excitement. He was the spitting image of Luca, right down to the serious furrow of his brows when he tried to act grown-up.\nThree-year-old Alina toddled in last, her curls bouncing with every step. She climbed onto the bed and threw her arms around my neck. \"Ride horsies!\" she demanded with a giggle.\nLuca and I exchanged amused glances. \"Alright, alright,\" I said, pulling Alina onto my lap. \"Go get ready, and we'll meet you outside.\"\nThe kids cheered and ran off, leaving the door wide open behind them.\nAs we made our way to the stables, I took a moment to marvel at how far we'd come. The clans were no longer two separate entities but one strong, united family. Luca and I had worked tirelessly to ensure peace and prosperity for everyone. It hadn't been easy, but seeing the smiles on our children's faces made it all worth it.\nBianca and Jenny had been instrumental in helping us maintain order. Bianca was now happily married to Zachary, the deputy who had won her heart all those years ago. They had two children of their own, and I couldn't have been prouder of the woman Bianca had become.\nJenny, true to her word, had found love in the most unexpected place-with a quiet, reserved healer from the clan. They were engaged now, and the sparkle in her eyes every time she spoke about him was proof enough of her happiness.\nThree years ago, we packed our bags and traveled back to the main packhouse for a momentous occasion-Alina's wedding. I remember how vibrant and joyous the ceremony was, a perfect blend of traditions and personal touches that reflected her fiery personality. The entire clan came together to celebrate, and it was a sight to behold.\nAlina, Finn's sister, had always been a strong and independent soul, but on her wedding day, she was a vision of grace and beauty. She married Damon, a respected warrior from a neighboring pack, and their union not only strengthened alliances but also brought happiness to everyone who knew them.\nFor Luca and me, the journey back to the packhouse was bittersweet. It brought back memories of Finn and everything we had endured to get to where we were. Yet, seeing Alina so happy reminded us of the resilience of family and the importance of love.\nOur children were just toddlers then, full of energy and curiosity. Merlin was seven, Finn was four, and our youngest, little Alina, was barely two but already showing signs of inheriting her father's stubbornness. They were the darlings of the wedding, stealing the spotlight with their antics and laughter.\nAlina had always been fond of our children, and that day was no exception. She spent hours playing with them, twirling little Alina around in her arms and letting the boys chase her through the gardens. She doted on them endlessly, and they adored her in return. Even now, when we visit her and Damon, her eyes light up at the sight of our kids. She spoils them with treats and stories, always making them feel like the most important people in the world.\nThe wedding itself was magical. The ceremony took place under the moonlight, a nod to our werewolf traditions. Alina and Damon exchanged vows surrounded by family, friends, and pack members, their love for each other evident in every word and glance.\nLuca and I stood among the crowd, hand in hand, watching as the couple pledged their lives to each other. It reminded me of our own journey and how love had grown between us despite the challenges we faced.\nThe celebration that followed was unforgettable. The feast was lavish, the music lively, and the dance floor packed. Luca and I took turns chasing after the kids, who were determined to be part of every activity. Merlin insisted on dancing with the bride, while Finn tried his best to keep up with the older kids.\nLooking back, that day marked a new",

Her marriage symbolized hope, unity, and the strength of bonds that transcend loss and hardship.\nEven now, Alina remains a cherished part of our lives. She's a loving aunt to our children, a trusted confidant, and a reminder of the enduring power of family.\nThe day passed in a blur of laughter and activity. Merlin and Finn raced their horses across the fields while Alina rode with Luca, her little hands clutching the reins as she squealed in delight.\nLater, we gathered in the garden for a family dinner. The kids played tag with the other children from the clan while the adults shared stories and plans for the future.\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Luca pulled me aside.\n\"Happy?\" he asked, his voice soft.\nI looked around at our children, at the family we'd built, at the life we'd created together. My heart swelled with gratitude and love.\n\"More than I ever thought possible,\" I replied, wrapping my arms around his waist.\nThat night, as we tucked the kids into bed, Merlin asked a question that caught me off guard.\n\"Mom, do you think I'll be the Alpha one day?\"\nI smiled, brushing a strand of hair from his face. \"Maybe. But being an Alpha isn't about power, Merlin. It's about love, responsibility, and doing what's best for your family and your people. If that's what you want, then one day, you'll make a great leader.\"\nHe nodded solemnly, his young mind already brimming with dreams.\nAs the house grew quiet, I found myself sitting on the balcony, gazing at the stars. Luca joined me, a glass of wine in his hand.\n\"Five years,\" he said, handing me the glass. \"Can you believe it?\"\nI shook my head, a smile playing on my lips. \"It feels like a lifetime ago and just yesterday all at once.\"\nHe took my hand, his thumb brushing against my skin. \"I couldn't have done any of this without you, Lia. You're my strength, my heart, my everything.\"\nTears welled in my eyes as I leaned into him. \"And you're mine, Luca. Always.\"\nThe sound of a soft cry interrupted our moment.\n\"That's Alina,\" I said, already standing.\nLuca chuckled. \"I've got her. You relax.\"\nI watched as he disappeared into the house, my heart full.\nLife wasn't perfect-it never would be. But it was ours, and it was beautiful.\nAs I turned my gaze back to the stars, a single thought filled my mind:\nThis was only the beginning.",

Trapped between his cruel obsession and a vengeful fiancée, she fights to uncover a family secret. Can she escape his grip, or will their twisted passion destroy her?\nIn the bustling coffee shop, she clutched her swollen cheek, the sting of the slap still fresh, yet she had no desire to retaliate. The onlookers around her cast scornful and disdainful glances, none stepping forward to help. Because she was Alvin Carter's daughter, they believed she deserved it.\n\"Victoria, your father killed so many people, and you still have the nerve to criticize me? If I were you, I'd be too ashamed to show my face!\" Ella Garcia sneered.\nVictoria Carter bowed her head in shame, her voice barely a whisper. \"I'm sorry, Miss Garcia, I misspoke. I apologize.\"\n\"Apologize? That's how you apologize to me? I sent you to the Honeycomb Cottage to buy a cake, and you made me wait forever, and this cake tastes awful! Do you think I'll accept this? What a joke!\" Ella said angrily. \"I am the heiress of the Garcia family, William Scott's fiancée! Even if I throw away a hundred, a thousand cakes, it's not your place to criticize!\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes, a bitter smile tugging at her lips. Faced with Ella's unreasonable accusations, she dared not retort. Even when she was the heiress of the Carter family, she had no right to get angry with Ella. And now, with Alvin arrested and her mother Nora Adams hospitalized due to stress, it was even less possible.\nNot to mention a slap, if needed, she had to endure dozens!\nSeeing Victoria remain silent, Ella grew even angrier. She grabbed a coffee cup from the table and smashed it against Victoria's head. \"You're the daughter of a murderer, why don't you just die?\"\nThe cup shattered on the floor, hot coffee splashing onto Victoria's delicate cheek, bringing searing pain. She bit her lip tightly, not daring to make a sound, but felt a wave of dizziness.\nElla, seeing her pitiful state, grew more furious. She picked up her bag from the table, ready to strike Victoria again.\n\"Stop!\" A man's voice commanded.\nElla turned to see the man who had burst through the door, a flash of surprise and joy in her eyes. She rushed to his side, clinging to his arm, and complained coquettishly, \"William! You're finally here, this Victoria nearly drove me mad.\"\nThe man walked in, carrying a bouquet of roses, which he handed to Ella. He gently played with her long curls, speaking softly, \"Sweetheart, there's no need to get upset with her. She's just an insignificant secretary. I'll make her apologize to you.\"\nVictoria, covered in coffee stains and blushing with embarrassment, stood awkwardly to the side. Hearing his tender words, she felt a chill run through her and glanced at him.\nSunlight poured through the large windows, highlighting his broad shoulders, narrow waist, and tall, sculpted physique-like a masterpiece of the gods.\nVictoria's eyes stung, her heart wrenching painfully.\nThis man was William Scott, her current sugar daddy and the heir to the Scott family. Just this morning, they had been intimately entwined in the Scott Group's office. Now, he was demanding she apologize to his fiancée, Ella.\n\"Apologize to Ella!\" William's voice turned icy.\nVictoria bit her lip, her eyes reddening, her body trembling, but she stubbornly refused to apologize in front of him.\nWilliam's jaw tightened as he stared at her, swallowing hard.\n\"Didn't you hear? William told you to apologize to me, or I'll have him fire you. Then how will you pay for your mother's medical bills?\" Ella commanded arrogantly, raising an eyebrow at Victoria.\nVictoria took a deep breath, clenching her teeth, tears finally streaming down her cheeks. \"I'm sorry,\" she choked out, bowing humbly.\nElla was right. If Victoria angered William, she would lose her livelihood. How would she then pay for Nora's medical bills, her brother Bobby Carter's tuition, and Alvin's enormous debts?\n\"Victoria, you're a disgrace!\" Ella sneered.\nHearing this, Victoria kept her head down, tears falling steadily to the floor.\nWilliam watched Victoria, her white dress soaked with coffee, clinging to her body, revealing her perfect curves. He felt his blood boil. Cursing silently, he clenched his fists tightly, taking a deep breath to suppress his urges.\n\"Ella, you should go now. I have some work to handle,\" William said coldly, regaining his composure.\n\"Alright.\" Ella glanced at him, a hint of reluctance in her eyes, then nodded sweetly and left the coffee shop.\nWilliam walked towards Victoria, towering over her. His eyes narrowed, his gaze deepening with desire.\nVictoria felt the intense, predatory gaze and looked up at him, asking, \"Mr. Scott?\"\nWilliam's eyes narrowed as he grabbed Victoria, pulling her into the coffee shop's restroom. He kicked open a stall door and pressed her against it.\nHis tall, imposing body pinned her down, his breath hot on her face. \"You look so enticing, I can't resist.\" With that, his thin lips covered hers, biting down hard with a punishing force.\nVictoria's eyes widened, staring at his handsome face so close to hers, her mind blank. William's kiss grew more urgent, as if he wanted to devour her completely.\nHe kissed her as if he were a wild animal savoring a rare treat. Victoria's hands were pinned against the cold wall, unable to break free, the pain unbearable.\n\"Let go... you're hurting me!\" Her weak protest only fueled William's fervor. He pressed his body tighter against hers, his rock-hard abs and the unmistakable bulge in his pants pressing against her abdomen.\nWilliam's hand cupped her bottom, the other roughly kneading her breasts, popping open her blouse buttons.\nJust as he was about to strip off her blouse, the sound of the door opening outside interrupted them.",

        "content": "Hearing the sounds outside, Victoria snapped back to reality, her eyes wide with fear. She pushed at William, urgently whispering, \"Not here... someone might see us... please...\"\nWilliam ignored her pleas, deaf to the noise outside. He roughly tore off her clothes, exposing her full breasts and the slender curve of her waist.\n\"William, please let go of me...\" she begged, her voice trembling with embarrassment.\nWilliam turned her around and bent her over the toilet. He leaned down, kissing her neck, his hands roaming over her curves. \"Baby,\" he murmured, his voice dripping with desire, like a devil tempting her.\nVictoria felt her thoughts scatter, a shiver running through her body, making her weak and powerless.\n\"William...\" she trembled, her voice shaking.\nHearing her voice, William felt his blood boil, unable to control himself any longer. He took her roughly.\n\"William... uh... ahhh...\"\nVictoria's voice was hoarse, trembling with moans. Her nails dug into her own skin as she bit her lip, struggling to endure the pain of his rough entry. Seeing her struggle only excited William more, making him even rougher.\nOutside, people heard the commotion, speculating about what was happening inside. A few sleazy guys next door started making lewd comments.\n\"Man, you guys are on fire in there.\"\n\"I bet she's a virgin!\"\n\"Yeah, with those awkward moans, she definitely doesn't have much experience.\"\nHearing these filthy words, Victoria was jolted awake, her face turning pale. Not wanting to endure this humiliation any longer, she tried to push William away with all her might, but he was too excited, continuing his relentless thrusts.\n\"Please, let me go,\" she cried, tears streaming down her face. Her legs felt like they were filled with lead, powerless, leaving her helplessly lying there.\nWilliam ignored her, becoming even more frenzied, taking her like a beast. Each thrust brought unbearable pain. She pounded his chest with her fists, hoping to make him stop, but her efforts only added to his pleasure.\nFinally, Victoria, numb, felt the wet, sticky sensation inside her as William finished, slowly letting her go.\nHe looked down at her with a satisfied grin, licking his lips. \"That was amazing.\"\nVictoria lay on the cold toilet seat, gasping for breath.\nWilliam adjusted his clothes, looking down at her with a dark expression. \"I'm in a good mood today, so I won't hold this against you. But if you ever upset my fiancée again, you know what will happen.\" He pulled out his wallet, tossing a card on the ground, and patted her cheek.\n\"Here's a hundred grand for this month. Be a good girl and come when I call. Pay off your father's million-dollar debt as soon as possible.\" With that, he walked out, his polished shoes clicking on the floor.\nVictoria trembled, picking up the card in humiliation. She slowly stood up, straightening herself, and staggered out of the restroom.\nShe went to the hospital and used the card to pay Nora's overdue medical bills. As she reached the door of the hospital room, she heard Nora's cheerful laughter inside.\nVictoria's nerves tightened, her hands gripping the door handle, veins bulging, knuckles white. She knew the only person who could make Nora this happy was Bobby.\nShe pushed the door open and walked straight in. Sure enough, Bobby was sitting by the bed, chatting warmly with Nora.\nBobby looked up and saw Victoria enter, a hint of mockery flashing in his eyes before he quickly masked it with a smile. \"Victoria, you're here,\" he greeted with a warm grin, but his smugness still peeked through.\nVictoria shot him a cold glance and nodded.\nSeeing Victoria's cold attitude towards Bobby, Nora was furious. \"You're such a pest! Your brother's so great, and you still treat him with a sour face? What's your problem?\"\nHer eyes were clouded with undisguised loathing as if Victoria was the most repulsive person in the world.\nBobby quickly held Nora's hand, comforting her. \"Mom, it's okay. Don't blame Victoria, she's always been like this.\"\n\"You are so considerate,\" Nora said, looking at Bobby with admiration, then turned to glare at Victoria. \"You ungrateful thing, you're not even half as good as Bobby.\"\nVictoria was used to Nora's favoritism towards Bobby and didn't argue. She quietly cleaned up the room's trash and said, \"I've paid the overdue medical bills. Take care of yourself.\"\n\"Paying it off so late, what a disgrace,\" Nora sneered, then turned to Bobby with a warm smile. \"Bobby, I heard your painting won second place in the national competition. You're amazing! You really inherited my talent!\"\nNora had been a well-known painter over twenty years ago, but an accident damaged her hand and ended her painting career. Since then, she had harbored resentment towards Victoria, convinced that Victoria's birth was the source of her misfortune.\nHowever, she pinned all her hopes on Bobby, seeing him as the extension of her artistic life.\nBobby's smile froze for a moment but quickly returned to normal. \"Thank you, Mom. It's nothing.\"\nVictoria paused her cleaning, listening to their conversation. Bobby's painting skills were not even half as good as hers, yet he had won second place in the national competition?\n\"By the way, you need to submit a portfolio in the second half of the year. How's that coming along?\" Nora asked with concern.\nBobby's face showed unease, nervously twisting his clothes and lowering his head. \"Actually, I...\"\nSeeing Bobby's hesitation, Nora became anxious. \"Bobby, what's wrong?\"\nVictoria stood by the door, coldly watching Nora and Bobby's affectionate performance, a mocking smile on her lips.\n\"Mom, the teacher said that with my current level, it's still risky to get into an art university. It's best to attend the training class held by the professors from that university to improve my chances of getting accepted.\" Bobby explained, his eyes reddening, biting his lip, looking very dejected.\nNora was stunned, then immediately worried. \"How can this be? Didn't you win second place in the national competition?\"\n\"The art university has many internal factions, and without connections, it's impossible to get in. This training class is just a way for the professors to collect bribes and reserve spots for those who can pay. But the cost is too high, it needs two hundred thousand, and with our current situation...\" Bobby bit his lip, speaking with a sense of grievance, while his eyes involuntarily darted towards Victoria. \n\"Victoria has money!\" Nora turned to Victoria, urgently commanding, \"Victoria, go get two hundred thousand for Bobby immediately!\"\nVictoria remained expressionless, as if she hadn't heard anything. Two hundred thousand? Did they think she was a bank?\nIt was the same old trick of acting pitiful to gain sympathy. Victoria was all too familiar with it and didn't even bother to respond.",

        "content": "\"Victoria!\" Nora's voice rang out, filled with fury. \"Didn't you hear me talking to you?\"\nVictoria stopped in her tracks, her back still to Nora. \"I won't give you the money,\" she said calmly.\n\"You brat! How dare you defy me now?\" Nora leapt from the bed, grabbing Victoria's arm and delivering a stinging slap across her face.\nVictoria endured the blow, her lips pressed tightly together, eyes full of defiance. \nAfter a moment, she spoke hoarsely, \"Mom, I'm just a college dropout. I've done everything I can to pay your medical bills. Ever since Dad's accident, you've been in the hospital. I've given up all my pride and taken those dead-end jobs just to cover your medical bills. We lost our house, and I've slept under bridges and in basements. But did you ever care about me even once? In your heart, is it only Bobby who's your child, while I'm just a stepping stone for him?\"\nNora was momentarily speechless, then reluctantly let go of Victoria. \"Why do you have to be so dramatic? I know you have money. Give Bobby the two hundred grand. If his education is delayed, you'll regret it!\"\nVictoria felt a sharp pang in her heart, her mind flooded with a wave of sorrow. She clenched her lower lip tightly, biting down so hard that the taste of blood filled her mouth. She closed her eyes, struggling to suppress the churning emotions, and it took several deep breaths to push back the lump in her throat.\n\"Mom, you knew all along,\" Victoria slowly opened her eyes, looking at Nora's startled face. \"You know where my money comes from...\"\nIt was money earned at the cost of her dignity. \nHer eyes were brimming with pain and disbelief, but she couldn't get the rest of the words past the lump in her throat.\nVictoria swallowed hard, her mouth filled with bitterness. \"If you know this, how can you expect me to pay for Bobby's training?\" she asked.\nNora avoided Victoria's sharp gaze, her voice stubborn. \"What's the difference between selling your body once and selling it multiple times? Why are you pretending to be so pure now?\"\nVictoria let out a bitter laugh. Was this something a mother should say to her daughter? Unable to stay in that suffocating room any longer, she pushed past Nora and stumbled out of the hospital room.\nWatching Victoria's retreating back, Nora felt a surge of anger. She kicked the leg of the table hard, shouting, \"Victoria, you ungrateful wretch! Come back here!\"\nThe next day, after finishing her shift at Scott Group, Victoria rushed to her part-time job at a clothing store. She worked until nearly ten o'clock when the store owner called her.\n\"Victoria,\" the owner said, sounding urgent. \"I need you to get these dresses to room 404 at the Starry Nights Hotel, right away. The customer's waiting, so don't mess around. If we nail this sale, I'll double your commission.\"\nThe store often had custom orders that needed delivery. Victoria picked up the dresses and hurried to the hotel.\nShe easily found the room and knocked on the door. A woman in a business suit opened the door, smiling warmly. \"You're here with the dresses, right? Come in.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Victoria said, stepping inside with the bags.\nAs soon as she entered, a pungent mix of smoke and alcohol hit her like a wall. She sensed something was wrong and turned to leave, but the door clicked shut behind her. The woman had locked it from the outside.\nIn the spacious bedroom, four lecherous men were seated, their eyes glinting with a repulsive, predatory lust as they roamed over her body.\nVictoria's heart raced with fear. She instinctively took a step back, and the bags in her hand nearly slipped from her grasp. She clutched the bags tightly, glaring at them. \"Who are you?\" she stammered.\nOne of the men stubbed out his cigarette, his gaze lingering on her. He licked his lips. \"What a beauty. Today is my lucky day.\"\nAs he spoke, he actually reached out to touch Victoria's face. His fingers, rough and greasy, were inches from her skin.\nVictoria took a big step back and snapped, \"Let me leave. Now. Or I'll call the police!\"\n\"Feisty, aren't you?\" the man chuckled, clicking his tongue in approval. \"What's your name?\"\nDespite her fear, Victoria tried to remain calm. \"I'm sorry, but I don't provide that kind of service,\" she said, grabbing the bags and heading for the door.\nBut the four men blocked her way. A burly man named Clifford warned, \"Don't make me use force.\"\nThe men closed in, cutting off her escape. Victoria's hands trembled as she discreetly reached into her pocket, pressing a random button, praying for a miracle.\nIt seemed her prayers were answered as she heard a man's voice on the other end of the line. Without waiting for him to speak, she quickly said, \"I'm in room 404 at the Starry Nights Hotel. Please help...\"\nBefore she could finish, one of the men snatched her phone and smashed it to pieces.\n\"What do you want?\" Victoria screamed, her voice shaking with terror.\n\"What do you think?\" Clifford sneered, advancing on her. \"I've been waiting for you. Be a good girl and cooperate.\" Then he lunged at Victoria, eager and impatient.\nVictoria tried to evade him, but it was useless. She struggled with all her might. Her fingernails dug into Clifford's forearm, leaving deep, bloody scratches. \nClifford winced in pain, but his anger only intensified. He pinned her to the ground, tearing at her thin blouse, leaving red marks on her skin with his rough hands.\n\"Help!\" Victoria cried, her vision blurred by tears. She struggled, but Clifford was too strong. He held her down, a sick smile on his face as he unbuckled his belt. \"You'll enjoy this soon enough!\"\nAs Clifford's hand reached for her, Victoria bit down hard on his arm. He screamed in pain, raising his hand to strike her. In desperation, Victoria grabbed his wrist and yanked, causing him to lose his balance and fall onto the bed.\nSeizing the opportunity, Victoria crawled towards the balcony. \"If you come any closer, I'll jump!\" she shouted, her voice filled with desperation.\nThe men hesitated, not wanting to cause a scene. Clifford, clutching his bitten arm, cursed, \"Bitch, I'll kill you!\"\n\"Don't jump. I'll open the door and let you go, okay?\" a skinny man with a scar on his eyebrow, Dean, approached and slightly opened the door.\nVictoria glanced at the ground below, then at the slightly open door. Her heart raced, but her will to survive prevailed. \"You all go to the bathroom. I'll leave on my own!\" she demanded.\nClifford and the others exchanged glances, reluctantly heading to the bathroom. Victoria took a deep breath, feeling a glimmer of hope. She quickly ran towards the door.\nJust as she was about to open it, the door slammed shut and locked from the outside. Victoria's heart sank. She pounded on the door, screaming, \"Why did you lock the door? Open it! Help!\"\nThe woman who had let her in was still guarding outside. Victoria collapsed to the floor in despair, staring at the closed door.\nBehind her, the four men emerged from the bathroom, evil smiles on their faces, slowly advancing towards her.",

        "content": "The bathroom door slammed shut, and the sound of it closing hit her heart like a sledgehammer.\n\"Stop fighting, you can't get away! Behave, and maybe it won't be so bad,\" Clifford said, reaching out to grab Victoria's thigh.\nVictoria kicked him hard. Clifford, wincing in pain, angrily raised his hand and slapped her across the face.\nHer cheek swelled up instantly, a bit of blood trickling from the corner of her mouth, and the pain made her head spin. Tears filled her eyes, and she started trembling uncontrollably.\nThe men began tearing at her clothes, leaving her outfit in shreds. She fought with everything she had, but she was no match for them.\nHer clothes were ripped apart, exposing her skin to the cold air, a wave of humiliation and helplessness washing over her.\nShe screamed desperately, \"Let me go! Help!\"\nBut the room was soundproof, and no one could hear her cries. She felt like she was falling into a bottomless pit.\n\"Let's see how long you can keep this up,\" Dean sneered. He shoved Victoria to the ground, leaving her almost completely exposed, and then pinned her down.\nVictoria fought back fiercely, kneeing Dean in the groin. Dean howled in pain, got up, and started punching and kicking her.\nVictoria felt like her body was being torn apart, the pain nearly making her pass out. She curled up into a ball, trying to protect herself, but the blows kept coming, hitting her body and head mercilessly.\nEach hit felt like a sledgehammer, making it hard for her to breathe. Her face was covered in tears and blood, and she started seeing stars, her consciousness fading.\nJust as she was about to lose hope, the door to the room was kicked open.\nWilliam stormed in with a team of imposing bodyguards. He froze when he saw Victoria being beaten and assaulted. An uncontrollable rage surged from his heart to his head. His face darkened, exuding a chilling aura.\n\"Who gave you the right to hurt her?\" William roared, his voice echoing through the room.\nThe four men shuddered in fear. Their arrogance vanished instantly upon seeing William and his bodyguards, and their faces turned pale.\nDean stammered, \"Who are you?\" His voice was filled with fear, and he could barely speak coherently.\nA flash of bloodthirsty rage crossed William's eyes as he signaled the bodyguards to drag Dean over. With a swift motion, he kicked Dean hard in the stomach, causing him to double over in pain and let out a piercing scream.\nWilliam said coldly, \"You don't deserve to know who I am!\" Then, turning to his bodyguards, he commanded, \"Take them out.\"\nNo sooner had he spoken than the bodyguards swiftly surrounded the four men. They swung their fists mercilessly, the sound of punches landing echoing in the room. The crisp sound of bones breaking filled the air, and the men writhed in pain on the floor. Cries and wails filled the room.\n\"Spare us! We won't do it again!\" Clifford cried out in pain. \"We really know we were wrong! Someone paid us to do it. Please let us go!\"\nWilliam ignored the pleas, his eyes locked on the battered and bruised Victoria. The moment Victoria saw William, a flicker of hope lit up her eyes.\nShe never imagined that in her darkest moment, William would come to her rescue. A surge of relief and joy filled her heart, like finding a lifeline in a storm.\nShe stared at William, as if he was her only savior. Her lips trembled, as if she wanted to say something, but she was too weak to speak.\nWilliam's face was like stone. He unbuttoned his suit jacket, wrapped it around Victoria, and gently picked her up. Victoria winced in pain, her injuries severe, with blood at the corner of her mouth and bruises marring her face.\nWilliam didn't spare another glance at the room, quickly carrying Victoria out. The door closed behind them, muffling the men's screams.\nIn the hallway, William strode forward, his anger barely contained. Victoria closed her eyes and curled up in his arms, her lips trembling. She clung to his shirt, not daring to let go.\nWilliam's eyes were dark with fury. He thought, 'No one probably hates Victoria more than I do. But despite everything, I've never really hurt her. How dare those bastards touch her?'\nAs they neared the elevator, he instinctively pressed Victoria's face against his chest, shielding her from prying eyes. As the elevator descended, he felt a burning wetness on his chest. William frowned, feeling increasingly uneasy.\nThe car was already waiting at the entrance of the Starry Nights Hotel. When the driver, Harry Brooks, saw them, he quickly opened the back door, ready to help Victoria.\nBut William didn't let go, bypassing the driver and placing Victoria in the back seat himself. Though his movements were brisk, he still managed to shield her head from hitting the car door.\nAfter a moment's hesitation, he got in as well, pulling Victoria into his arms. At that moment, Victoria was like a fragile kitten, snuggling against him.\nWilliam looked down at Victoria and noticed she was trembling slightly. He frowned and asked coldly, \"Are you cold?\"\nWhen Victoria didn't respond, he looked at her face and realized something was wrong.\nVictoria's face was pale, her brows furrowed, her lips trembling. Curled up as if to stifle an inner turmoil, her body quaked violently. Her lips were dry and tinged with purple, and her eyes were squeezed tightly shut.\nWilliam panicked, raising his hand to touch her forehead. The burning heat transferred to his palm, and his brows furrowed tightly, his eyes filled with anxiety.\nHe said, \"Victoria? Wake up!\"\nIn a daze, Victoria seemed to hear someone calling her. She opened her eyes and saw William's anxious and worried expression. She forced a weak smile, but the movement caused her facial wounds to hurt, making her gasp in pain.\nShe responded, \"I'm sorry, Mr. Scott. I'm fine. I just need to sleep for a while.\"\nHer eyes were filled with confusion and helplessness, reddened and pitiful. Seeing her like this, William suddenly felt his heart soften.",

        "content": "\"Get to the hospital quickly,\" William barked, his voice sharp.\n\"On it,\" Harry, the driver, replied without missing a beat, flooring it toward the nearest private hospital.\nHalf an hour later, they pulled up at the hospital. The top chief physician had already been alerted, and as soon as they hit the entrance, Victoria was whisked into the emergency room.\nWilliam stood outside, his usually composed face etched with worry.\n\"Mr. Scott, don't stress too much. Ms. Carter will be alright,\" Harry tried to reassure him.\n\"Who's worried about her?\" William snapped, a bit irritated. Realizing how childish he sounded, he quickly added, \"I just hope she doesn't hold up work.\"\nHarry nodded quickly, but inside, he was rolling his eyes. William was clearly worried but just wouldn't admit it. Such a tsundere.\nIn a VIP hospital room, Victoria lay on the bed, looking pale and weak.\nVictoria's eyes fluttered open, her consciousness still hazy. But the moment her gaze fell on anxious, caring Nora by the bedside, her heart skipped a beat. It was the scene she had imagined so many times before.\nFor a moment, Victoria even wondered if this was a beautiful hallucination brought on by the brink of death.\nNora's eyes were slightly red-rimmed, and she gently took Victoria's hand in hers. Carrying a hint of genuine relief and lingering fear, she said, \"Victoria, you're finally awake. I was so scared last night. I felt like I'd lost a part of myself. I just hope you'll be okay.\" \nThen she leaned closer to Victoria, touching foreheads, as if to check if Victoria still had a fever.\nVictoria shook her head slightly, staring at Nora without blinking.\n\"You silly girl, how did you end up like this?\" Nora frowned slightly and continued, \"You have no idea how worried I was. From the moment I heard you were in trouble, I couldn't rest. I prayed all night for your safety.\"\nHer voice trembled, clearly scared. Victoria's tears started flowing, each one soaking into the pillow.\n\"Why are you crying? Are you in pain? If it hurts, tell me, and I'll call the doctor.\" Nora scanned Victoria's body, worried she might be uncomfortable. She gently pulled up Victoria's blanket, covering her with tender care.\nA warm feeling surged in Victoria's heart; she had never felt such genuine concern from Nora. She choked back tears and tried to control her emotions. She said, \"Mom, don't worry; I'm fine.\"\nAt that moment, she seemed to forget all her pain and grievances, feeling only warmth.\nHowever, this feeling didn't last long. Nora hesitated for a moment, then changed the subject. \"Victoria, Bobby's training camp is really important. Could you...\"\nVictoria's face instantly turned stiff and grim. She realized that Nora's concern was all a facade, just an attempt to ask for money. Her throat tightened, as she felt like a thorn was stuck, making it hard to speak.\nShe bit down hard to stop her tears from falling, her voice trembling, \"Mom, why have you always favored Bobby? Even now, you still think of him first. Aren't I your child, too?\"\nHer voice trembled, tears welling up in her eyes.\nHer thoughts instantly returned to the past, scenes of being ignored and treated differently by Nora playing like a movie in her mind.\n\"When Bobby was sick, you dropped everything to stay by his side day and night, applying ointment and feeding him, your face filled with tender affection. But when I had a high fever, I lay alone in my room, calling out for you but getting no response. In the end, it was the nanny who couldn't bear to see me like that. She brought me a glass of water and some medicine.\" Victoria's eyes were filled with pain. \n\"At the school's parent-child event, all the other kids were with their moms, but I could only watch enviously. You said you had to take Booby to his painting class, and I didn't even have the courage to ask you to stay with me... For Bobby's birthday, there's always a party, with gifts and trips, but what about mine? Do you even remember my birthday?\"\nShe continued, \"When Bobby drew a decent picture, you couldn't wait to frame it and hang it in the living room, showing off his talent to everyone. But even when I won an award at school and brought my drawing home, you didn't even glance at the gift and just tossed it aside.\" \nVictoria's voice grew more agitated, \"After Dad's accident, I dropped out of college, running around every day for your medical bills and Bobby's tuition and living expenses, exhausted. Yet, all I got in return was even more unfair treatment from you.\"\nAt the mention of Alvin, Victoria became increasingly emotional. She clutched her chest, crying out in anguish, \"Why? What did I do wrong? All the grievances and hardships I've endured, you never cared. It was always for Bobby, making me sacrifice myself. I'm your daughter too! Why can't you treat me fairly for once?\"\nVictoria's heart was filled with despair and pain. She looked at Nora, her eyes full of questions and expectations, hoping for a reasonable explanation.\nNora, however, was completely indifferent to her pain and said, \"You're the older sister; you should take care of Bobby. Besides, money's easy for you now, so why not help him out?\"\nHearing Nora's words, Victoria felt her anger and grievances boil over. She shouted, \"I've had enough! I'm not your ATM! I have my own life, my own dreams. Why do you never consider my feelings?\"\nVictoria and Nora argued fiercely, their words cutting and intense. Victoria's heart was heavy with sorrow and helplessness. She realized that Nora might never change, and all her years of expectations and efforts were in vain.\nMeanwhile, William stood at the doorway, his eyebrows slightly furrowed. His deep eyes flickered with surprise for a moment, before a more complex emotion crossed his face. He had heard the argument between Victoria and Nora.\nAfter a bit, William opened the door and walked in. Seeing him, Victoria turned her head away, wiping her tears with her sleeve, not wanting him to see her in such a miserable and painful state.\nWilliam looked at her sad face and felt his heart stir slightly. He didn't say anything, just standing there silently, and the room fell into an awkward silence.\nIn the end, it was Nora who couldn't stand it, glaring at Victoria hatefully before turning back to her room. Before leaving, she even took the apple she had peeled for Victoria, intending to give it to Bobby later.\nThe hospital room was now empty, except for the two of them.",

She wiped away her tears and glanced up at William.\n\"How are those people?\" she asked, her voice barely a whisper.\nCaught off guard, William paused for a moment before saying, \"Don't worry. I messed them up pretty bad to get back at them for you.\"\nVictoria's eyes widened in surprise, but then she felt a wave of gratitude. She knew William did it for her, and she felt a rush of appreciation for his protection.\n\"Did you hand them over to the police?\" Victoria asked again.\nWilliam hesitated. He tried to change the subject. \"How are you feeling now? Does the wound still hurt?\" he asked.\nVictoria sensed something was off, her eyes narrowing in suspicion. \"You didn't hand them over to the police? Do you know who sent them?\" she pressed.\nWilliam stayed silent, unsure of what to say. He did know who was behind it, but he didn't want Victoria to find out.\n\"Answer me!\" Victoria's voice grew louder, her emotions getting the best of her. \"Are you trying to protect the person who did this?\"\nWilliam's silence only confirmed her suspicions. \"Tell me who it is! I'll handle it myself!\" she demanded.\nWilliam frowned and snapped, \"Enough already! You weren't that badly hurt. Just let it go.\"\nVictoria stared at him in disbelief. \"Let it go? I almost...\"\nHer eyes filled with tears, and she trembled as if reliving the trauma. \"I almost jumped from the twenty-something floor, and you want me to let it go? Why?\"\nWilliam's heart skipped a beat, a flicker of guilt flashing in his eyes. But then he got angry. His face darkened, and he sneered, \"Who do you think you are? You're just a whore who'd do anything for money! Acting all high and mighty?\"\nHis words cut through Victoria like a knife. Her face went even paler, her eyes wide with shock and pain. She couldn't believe William would say something like that. But then those awful memories came flooding back.\nYes, she had sold herself to William for money. It was out of necessity, but it was still true. She felt exposed, like everyone could see her shame.\n\"You'd do anything for money. Who knows if you were out hooking yesterday?\" William's words grew nastier, a cruel smile on his lips. \"So dirty.\"\nHis words felt like a slap, making Victoria's face burn as if it had been slashed open.\nWithout thinking, Victoria slapped him, catching William off guard. \"Your words are outrageous!\" she cried, her voice shaking with despair, her face even paler. William's face darkened, his eyes burning with anger and disgust.\nVictoria, Alvin's daughter, the one who caused so much pain, dared to slap William? In a flash, William's hatred for Victoria surged like a tidal wave.\n\"Victoria, you're getting way out of line!\" William snarled through clenched teeth. He grabbed her wrist and flipped her over, pinning her down on the bed. His bloodshot eyes bore into hers, radiating aggression.\n\"William, let go of me!\" Victoria screamed in pain.\nBut William seemed deaf to her cries. His eyes were filled with a dark desire and impulse. His anger had taken over, and now he just wanted to vent.\nWilliam's hands started roaming over Victoria's body, roughly caressing her slender figure. Victoria endured the intense pain, struggling and resisting. But against an enraged and irrational William, she felt powerless.\nShe felt his hands moving over her, each touch sending a shiver through her, a mix of pain and an unbearable sensation.\nShe cried and begged, \"No, please let me go!\"\nHer pleas only seemed to excite William more. He roughly tore off her hospital gown, exposing her breasts. He leaned down, kissing her shoulders, gently nibbling on her delicate skin.\nThe tingling sensation seeped into Victoria's bones, making her shiver involuntarily. Her body trembled more visibly, and the places where William kissed and nibbled also shook.\nShe tried to turn her neck to avoid his kisses, but William didn't give her a chance to escape. He grabbed her jaw, forcing her mouth open, and his tongue slipped inside.\nA painful moan escaped from Victoria's throat. She felt a surge of heat, making her feel ashamed and unable to control it.\nWilliam took advantage, moving forward with his assault. He greedily sucked on her, like a child savoring a treat. Victoria struggled desperately, her legs kicking at his chest, trying to break free.\nBut the more she resisted, the angrier William got. He flipped her over and straddled her again. His large hand reached between her legs, grasping her labia, and slowly rubbed it.\nVictoria keenly felt his touch, unable to help but moan.\n\"Why are you so sensitive?\" William's teasing voice echoed through the room. He smiled wickedly and continued, \"You're really lewd.\"\nHis fingers slowly moved down along her labia, gently teasing and playing with the area between the labia.\nVictoria involuntarily contracted her body, a flush appearing on her pale face. She tightly clamped her legs around his waist, trying to prevent him from invading her most private area.\n\"William, stop!\" Victoria suddenly screamed, her legs loosening.\nBetween her legs, a hard penis suddenly appeared, pressing against her tender and warm vagina.\nVictoria's face instantly flushed red. She bit her lip, forcibly suppressing the feeling of humiliation, trying to ignore the hard penis.\nBut William had no intention of giving up the pleasure of teasing her. He continued to rub, occasionally thrusting.",

Hearing her, William got even more excited, thrusting into her warm, soft body and moving in a steady rhythm.\nVictoria's body tensed up, sweat forming on her forehead, and she was in such intense pain that she almost fainted, biting her lip to keep from making a sound.\nHer face turned pale, and sweat dripped down her temples, soaking the pillow. She felt like her body was being crushed, like she was in a burning furnace. The agony was so intense she nearly convulsed, like a flower about to wither, left to be ravaged.\nWilliam kept moving, his thrusts making it hard for Victoria to breathe. Her mind went blank. Finally, William released himself, ejaculating before slowly pulling out and lying beside her, panting.\n\"Did you enjoy it?\" William asked with a cold smile.\nVictoria's face was as pale as paper, her eyes unfocused. She didn't deny it because she didn't have the strength.\n\"Slut! You're just like Avlin-really disgusting!\" William spat out fiercely.\nVictoria felt like a bolt of lightning had struck her out of nowhere. Her entire being felt shattered. She went from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows in an instant, crashing straight into the depths of despair.\nShe stared in disbelief at the man who had just been inside her. How could he humiliate her like this? He even insulted her most beloved father!\nShe felt so dirty, so low. In extreme pain and self-denial, Victoria felt a sharp pain in her chest, as if a fire was burning. Her body swayed, and her vision began to blur. She wanted to say something, but no sound came out.\nBlood, thick and salty, flooded her throat. She felt like she was burning from the inside out, her body shaking uncontrollably.\nVictoria coughed violently, blood pouring from her mouth and nose. It splattered on the white sheets, staining them with dark red blotches. Her vision blurred, and William's face swam out of focus. She collapsed backward, hitting the bed with a thud, and everything went black\nWilliam, who had been lost in his twisted high, was suddenly struck by the sight. His mind went blank, his heart seized up, and a wave of fear he'd never felt before washed over him.\nHe looked at Victoria lying naked on the blood-stained sheets, her eyes closed and her face as pale as paper. She appeared lifeless, like a broken doll.\nHe quickly reached out, gently touching Victoria's cheek. Her skin was so cold that his heart sank. He shouted, \"Victoria! Wake up!\"\nHis mind was in chaos, thoughts intertwining, his eyes filled with confusion as he looked at Victoria, unconscious on the bed. Hatred and disgust still surged within him, but there was also an inexplicable trace of worry. He didn't understand why he felt this way. He should hate her and want her to suffer as he had. But seeing Victoria in such a fragile state, fainting from his humiliation, he felt a twinge of guilt.\nAfter quickly dressing himself and Victoria, he pressed the call button. The doctor arrived quickly.\nSmelling the scent in the room, the doctor felt a moment of awkwardness. But he quickly composed himself, walked to Victoria, and checked her condition.\n\"How is she?\" William asked urgently.\nAfter a thorough examination, the doctor became very serious, advising earnestly, \"Sir, please be more restrained. The patient was seriously injured yesterday, and her body has been very weak. She seems to have been suffering from long-term insomnia and hasn't been eating properly. She's very thin, showing signs of anorexia and depression. The recent emotional upset has worsened her condition. She needs to rest.\"\nHearing the doctor's words, William frowned.\n\"Are you sure she has anorexia and depression?\" William questioned, \"She always seemed so strong.\"\n\"These are just some early symptoms. Sir, please take good care of the patient's emotions,\" the doctor replied, then began emergency treatment for Victoria.\nWilliam stood by the bed, staring at Victoria's pale face, feeling a whirlwind of emotions. After a moment, he called Harry. \"Get a caregiver for her,\" he said quietly, then left the hospital.\nHe wasn't sure why he was doing this-maybe a bit of guilt, or maybe he didn't want her to die just yet. She still had \"debts\" to repay.\nHarry looked at Victoria's frail state on the bed, feeling a pang of sympathy. Her face was ghostly pale, tubes sticking out of her, making her look incredibly fragile and helpless. But Harry was just an employee and couldn't go against William's orders.\nHe quickly found an experienced caregiver and instructed, \"Take good care of her and report any changes to me.\"\nThe caregiver nodded, promising to look after Victoria.\nVictoria lay in the hospital, drifting in and out of consciousness for two days. During this time, Nora came to see her. She glanced at Victoria's pale face, saw she wasn't awake, and frowned. \"Ugh, when is she gonna wake up already? We're waiting on her cash.\" \nNora didn't even think about getting closer to the hospital bed. Instead, she crossed her arms, walked around the room, and looked at everything with cold eyes, like she was just examining some insignificant object. After a few minutes, she got bored, pulled out her phone, and then left with a huff.\nVictoria spent two days unconscious in the hospital. As soon as she came to, William ordered her back to the company, saying there was an important event she had to attend. \nThe Scott Group had been working on this project for a long time and finally managed to get the two key executives to attend the dinner.\nIf they could secure this deal, the Scott Group's influence would rise significantly. So William couldn't afford any mistakes at this dinner.\nSince he had worked on this project with Victoria from the beginning, she had to attend the dinner. When Victoria received the notice, she felt a sense of helplessness and bitterness.\nHer body was still very weak, with every movement feeling like knives cutting into her, but she knew she had no right to refuse.\nWhen Victoria arrived at the Scott Group, William happened to be coming down the stairs.\nToday, he was dressed in a dark custom suit, with a neat tie and a gemstone pin that gleamed coldly. His shoes were polished, and he stood tall and imposing, exuding a cold and noble aura.\nHis chiseled features bore a distant expression, and his stoic demeanor created an invisible barrier that made him difficult to approach.\nVictoria hurriedly got out of the taxi, hastily tidying her clothes, and then walked quickly towards William in her high heels. Yet she stopped about three feet away from him.\n\"Mr. Scott,\" Victoria said respectfully, bowing her head slightly.\nWilliam glanced at the limited-edition Rolex on his wrist. The dial was a deep, dark blue. He then gave Victoria a cold, indifferent look, his eyes devoid of any warmth. Without a word, he walked straight toward his black Maybach.\nVictoria quickly walked a few steps ahead to open the car door for William. After he got in, she gently closed the door and then got into the passenger seat.\nToday's crucial business meeting was arranged at the city's top five-star hotel.\nWilliam valued this project highly and had been personally involved from the start. The other party seemed to sense William's seriousness and had been trying to get the best deal.\nWhen they met in the reserved private room, they first exchanged handshakes and pleasantries.\nKirk Gutierrez, one of them, said, \"Hello, Mr. Scott. I've heard so much about you. It's great to meet you in person finally. You truly live up to your reputation.\"\nWilliam and Victoria were young and imposing, while the other party consisted of a group of shrewd men in their forties. They shook hands with William first, then turned their attention to Victoria.\n\"And this is...\" asked the other man, Rufus Chapman.\nVictoria got up slowly. Her tailored suit hugged her slender, curvy figure. Her small, delicate face was perfectly made up. But even with all the makeup, you could still see how tired and worn-out she was.\nShe smiled and introduced herself, \"Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Chapman. I'm Mr. Scott's assistant, Victoria.\"\nAfter they sat down, William got straight to the point, discussing the project.\nHowever, the other party was cunning. Kirk waved his hand, his eyes fixed on the beautiful Victoria, and said, \"With such a beauty here, why talk about work? Let's eat first.\"",

        "content": "The other party was clearly trying to brush off William. If they really didn't want to talk business today, they wouldn't have shown up with such a big entourage.\nVictoria sat next to William, eyeing the glass of water she had just poured. The waiter had brought in a jug of water earlier. She'd been injured recently and was still pretty weak. The doctor had told her to avoid alcohol and cold drinks. But today...\nVictoria gently picked up the glass, filled it with red wine, and stood up, a perfect smile on her face. \"I'm sure everyone knows how strong the Scott Group is. Trust us, we won't let you down,\" she said.\nIn a room full of men, a woman's words carried a lot of weight. Sure enough, Rufus and Kirk stopped using the \"no work talk during meals\" excuse.\nRufus, with his big belly, stared at the elegant Victoria, grinning. He said, \"Mr. Gutierrez and I have checked out your company's credentials. We've also heard that Ms. Carter is quite the drinker. It just so happens that we can hold our liquor too. How about a drinking contest?\"\nVictoria had just been through a lot, her body hadn't fully recovered, and her wounds still ached. She quietly placed one hand near her wound, her delicate makeup making her look quite well, not too haggard.\nBut Rufus didn't give Victoria a chance to refuse, directly asking the waiter to bring the wine. Soon, the waiter brought an ice bucket with several bottles of wine inside, mixed with ice cubes.\n\"This wine is best enjoyed cold!\" Kirk cheerfully took a chilled bottle from the ice bucket, opened the cap, and first poured wine for Victoria.\nThe wine glass was filled to the brim, then he poured for himself and Rufus, and raised his glass.\nHe continued, \"Ms. Carter, you must show us some respect.\"\nVictoria looked down at the full glass of wine, her fingertips lightly touching the rim. The cold feeling made her shiver.\nWilliam leaned slightly against the back of the chair, one hand casually placed on the table, fingers lightly tapping the surface. While others were clueless about his emotions, Victoria, who knew him well, could tell he was losing his patience.\nVictoria's heart tightened a bit. She lifted her head slightly and smiled, \"We are gathered here today for better cooperation opportunities. The Scott Group has always been based on integrity and has strong capabilities. I believe in our future cooperation, and we will bring you substantial returns. Let me drink this glass of wine first as a toast to our upcoming cooperation.\"\nAfter speaking, she raised her glass and drank it all in one go. \nThe cold liquor felt like a knife slicing down her throat, and a sharp pain surged through her. She almost lost her balance but clenched her teeth to keep from showing any weakness. Her usually delicate face turned slightly pale.\nSensing Victoria's sincere attitude, Kirk and Rufus also drank a glass. With the drinks down, it was time to start discussing the cooperation.\nVictoria put down her glass and got to the point. She said, \"Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Chapman, since you are willing to meet us, it shows that you recognize our capabilities. We also cherish the opportunity to cooperate with your company. Since both sides have the intention to cooperate, why hesitate? Early cooperation is beneficial for both of us, isn't it?\"\nKirk frowned a bit and said, \"Ms. Carter, you're right. We know the Scott Group is strong. But the market's tough right now, and we have to think about our company's interests. We've also looked into another company. They not only promised a 10% discount but also offered extra technical support and professional training, which is really appealing to us.\"\nVictoria smiled slightly and said, \"I get your concerns. But the Scott Group has the best R&D team in the industry, can provide personalized services for clients, and has a comprehensive after-sales service system. Sure, the other company offers some extras, but can they match us in these areas?\"\nRufus nodded and said, \"Ms. Carter, you make a good point. But their offer is very tempting.\"\nVictoria calmly replied, \"The offer might seem tempting, but it's just short-term benefits. We promise long-term cooperation and mutual benefit. I'm sure you'll make the right choice once you've thought it through.\"\nHearing this, Kirk and Rufus started to mull it over.\nAt this moment, William straightened up a bit, his eyes showing unshakable confidence.\nHe slowly said, \"Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Chapman, we will provide your company with comprehensive resource support, including market promotion, talent training, and more. We'll also send a professional team to your company to understand your specific needs and pain points and then create the best development strategy for you. Our goal is to advance together with your company and create a leading enterprise in the industry.\"\nWilliam's words made Kirk and Rufus's eyes light up. They exchanged glances and saw the excitement in each other's eyes.\nVictoria immediately understood William's intention. At some point, just one look from him was enough for her to understand his thoughts.\nThe two glasses of cold wine were already taking their toll; her wound felt like it was being stabbed by thousands of sharp blades, with the pain spreading intensely. Victoria almost couldn't stand, but she managed to avoid an embarrassing fall by gripping the chair firmly as she sat down.\nShe took a deep breath and stood up again. She first picked up the wine bottle, then took William's wine glass, and poured wine for him.\nWilliam took the wine glass from Victoria, stood up, and slightly raised his hand. When he looked at Kirk and Rufus, his face still showed no expression, his voice was not loud, but his words were powerful and convincing.\nVictoria also stood up and said, \"Mr. Scott rarely makes promises. But now that he's promising to give you full resource support and tailored development strategies, it shows he really values this partnership and has high hopes for it. So, Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Chapman, consider it carefully.\"\nIt must be said that William was very good at tempting people.",

        "content": "On one side, there's a 10% discount along with technical support and professional training; on the other side, there's comprehensive resource support and a customized development strategy. Any smart person would go for the latter.\nBut investing wasn't just about winning or losing.\nTo make money, it took more than just empty promises; it required real skills and a bit of luck.\nSensing the hesitation, Victoria didn't waste time. She grabbed another bottle of wine from the ice bucket and popped it open.\nHolding the bottle, she looked straight at Kirk and Rufus and said, \"We won't let your company down. This is our promise.\"\nThen she took a swig straight from the bottle, the wine level dropping visibly. Victoria's bold move even made the shrewd businessmen Kirk and Rufus feel a bit embarrassed.\nThey stared for a moment, then burst into cheers, \"Great!\"\nVictoria set down the now-empty bottle.\n\"Just for Ms. Carter's sincerity, we believe you won't let us down!\" That was it-the deal was sealed.\nVictoria's lips curled into a slight smile. \"Thank you, Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Chapman, for your trust,\" she said.\n\"Come on, let's toast to our partnership!\" She grabbed her wine glass and clinked glasses with both of them.\nOne glass after another, the spicy and cold sensation cycled through, numbing Victoria gradually. She couldn't feel the spiciness of the wine, the coldness, or even the pain of her wounds.\nAfter some time, Kirk and Rufus were completely drunk. Their faces were flushed, eyes glazed, and they staggered as they stood up. Seeing this, Victoria quickly stepped forward to help their assistants support them to the door.\nThe night breeze blew gently, bringing a slight chill.\nVictoria stood by the car, watching as Kirk and Rufus were carefully helped into the car. She bowed slightly and waved goodbye.\nThe car slowly started, and she stood there, watching it disappear into the night. She let out a sigh of relief; the tough business negotiation had finally reached a successful conclusion.\nHowever, Victoria also felt sharp pain and deep fatigue, and her head was a bit dizzy. Then, she turned and walked towards the car parked not far away. Her steps were unsteady, each one feeling like stepping on cotton.\nBut she still tried to maintain her composure, not wanting to show her fatigue and discomfort. She opened the car door and sat in the passenger seat, letting out a light sigh as she leaned back, as if shedding a heavy burden.\nThe car was filled with a faint leather scent, quiet and warm. Victoria closed her eyes, trying to alleviate her fatigue and pain, enduring it silently despite the pain she felt all over.\nWilliam had woken up in the back seat at some point, looking at the rearview mirror expressionlessly. He saw Victoria leaning against the window, only seeing one of her shoulders, but his gaze stayed on her the whole way.\nThe car stopped at the entrance of an old apartment complex. Harry, looking at the sleeping William through the rearview mirror, carefully said to Victoria, \"Ms. Carter, we're at your place.\"\nHearing the voice, Victoria slowly opened her eyes and realized she was home. She frowned slightly and softly said, \"Thank you,\" then grabbed her bag and got out of the car.\nThe sound of the door closing woke William. His eyes followed the slender figure, watching Victoria stagger into the building. Once she was out of sight, William signaled Harry to drive away.\nDragging her exhausted body, Victoria quickly climbed the stairs to her rented apartment. Her hands trembled as she inserted the key into the lock, gently turning it. With a click, the door slowly opened.\nDarkness rushed in like a tide, enveloping her tightly. The living room was pitch black, eerily silent, like a forgotten island, dead and oppressive.\nVictoria stood quietly at the door for a long time, not moving to turn on the light. It seemed only in this darkness could she find a moment of peace. Sighing, she reached out and pressed the switch on the wall, and the living room instantly lit up.\nVictoria suddenly felt chest tightness and shortness of breath, her throat unbearably dry. She slowly moved to the sofa, wanting to sit down and rest. Suddenly, a wave of nausea hit her, and she stumbled to the bathroom, collapsing by the toilet and vomiting painfully.\nThe vomit spewed from her mouth, the intense discomfort making her body tremble uncontrollably. Each bout of vomiting felt like an invisible hand was violently pulling at her insides, the pain washing over her like a tide. Her forehead was covered in fine sweat, her face pale as paper.\nAfter vomiting, Victoria leaned weakly against the toilet, tears silently falling. At this moment, she was like a lone boat lost in the vast sea. After a long time, she slowly stood up and opened the fridge, hoping to find something to ease her stomach discomfort.\nHowever, the fridge was empty, with only a few expired drinks and some withered vegetables. Victoria sighed frustratedly, closed the fridge, and prepared to lie down on the bed for a while.\nJust then, there was a light knock on the door.\nVictoria hesitated, a hint of curiosity rising within her. Who could it be at this late hour?\nShe opened the door to find her landlord, Elara West, standing there with a bowl of steaming oatmeal. Elara's face was gentle, her eyes full of kindness.\nSeeing Victoria's pale face, Elara said with concern, \"Victoria, I saw you came back so late and thought you probably hadn't eaten yet. I just made some oatmeal, so I brought you a bowl. Eat it while it's hot to warm yourself up.\"\nLooking at Elara, Victoria felt a surge of indescribable emotion. Her eyes instantly welled up, and she said with a choked voice, \"Elara, thank you. You're always so caring.\"\nElara gently patted Victoria's shoulder and responded, \"Silly child, don't mention it. It isn't easy for a young woman to make it on her own; you need to take good care of yourself. If you have any difficulties, just let me know. Don't shoulder it alone. I won't disturb your rest.\"\nWith that, she turned and went back upstairs.\nVictoria took the oatmeal, closed the door, and returned to her room. She sat at the table, looking at the steaming oatmeal, tears streaming down her face uncontrollably. She covered her mouth, letting the tears flow, crying silently. After a long time, she calmed down and slowly ate the oatmeal.\nThe next day, Victoria, despite her discomfort, went to the Scott Group. However, when she walked into the office, she found Ella there too.\nElla was dressed in an expensive dress, her makeup exquisite, her eyes full of undisguised arrogance and provocation.\nAs William's fiancée, she had always been domineering in the Scott Group. As soon as Victoria walked in, a hint of malice flashed in Ella's eyes.",

        "content": "When Victoria walked in, the whole office got tense, like even the sunlight dimmed a bit.\nWilliam was rocking a sharp dark suit, his tall frame looking all kinds of perfect. His face was like it was carved from stone, with those intense eyebrows and eyes that screamed authority. He saw Victoria and frowned a little.\n\"Well, Victoria, you look like crap. What were you up to last night? Something shady, maybe?\" Ella sneered, loud enough for everyone to hear.\nShe tilted her chin up and gave Victoria a once-over, like she was looking at something gross. The other folks in the office looked awkward, quickly burying their heads in their work, not wanting to get involved.\nSome whispered among themselves, grumbling about Ella, but no one dared to stand up for Victoria. After all, Ella was William's fiancée, and no one wanted to risk their job. The air in the office felt like it was freezing, making everyone uncomfortable.\nVictoria frowned but tried to ignore Ella's nonsense.\nBut Ella wasn't done. \"What? You think you're special? You're just using your looks to get ahead.\"\nHer words were like daggers, each one aimed at Victoria.\nElla strutted over, lifted Victoria's chin with a painted nail, and sneered, \"Look at you. Do you really think you can climb the ladder?\"\nVictoria was used to Ella's jabs and stayed calm. She took a deep breath and said, \"Ms. Garcia, I'm just doing my job.\"\n\"Yeah, right. Everyone knows you're trying to impress William,\" Ella scoffed, crossing her arms. \"Now, go sort all the project files for this quarter. Reclassify them like I said, and I want them on my desk by the end of the day. Screw it up, and you're in big trouble.\"\nShe dumped a huge stack of files on the floor, way more than one person could handle in a day.\nVictoria didn't flinch, just starting picking them up, ready to get to work. But she was feeling worse, dizzy and barely able to stand. Still, she straightened up, not showing any weakness.\nThe office was so quiet that only the sound of pages turning and Victoria's somewhat heavy breathing could be heard.\nElla yelled, \"Hurry up. If you mess up William's work, you're done.\" Her voice was like nails on a chalkboard, making everyone wince.\nElla watched Victoria, feeling smug. She was here to see if Victoria knew she was behind that incident. If Victoria knew, she'd have to shut her up for good.\nElla thought, 'That idiot has no clue. William still cares about me.'\nAfter a while, Victoria felt so bad she went to the restroom. In a stall, she heard some colleagues talking.\n\"Victoria, isn't she just a high school grad? Everyone here has a master's or Ph.D., even the receptionist went to a top school, but Victoria acts like she's somebody,\" a sharp voice said.\nAnother woman chimed in, \"Totally. I heard she's just a nobody who sleeps her way up. Look at her, she must've done something shady to get her job.\"\n\"Yeah, she must be sleeping with Mr. Scott. Why else would he make her his secretary? She's probably easy, anyone could have her,\" a rough voice added nastily.\nThe first woman spoke again, \"She deserves everything Ella throws at her. Trying to seduce someone's fiancé? She should be shamed.\"\nVictoria listened to their cruel words with a blank face, her fists clenched so tight her nails dug into her palms, but she didn't feel the pain.\nShe couldn't wrap her head around how these women, her peers, could be so vicious. She fought to keep her emotions in check, reminding herself not to let their words get to her. They didn't know her, and their opinions didn't matter.\nOnce they left, Victoria stepped out of the stall and fixed herself up at the sink. But then, a wave of nausea hit her, and she covered her mouth, trying hard not to throw up.\nThe discomfort made her face even paler, sweat dotting her forehead. She leaned on the sink, taking a moment to stop the retching.\nShe slowly lifted her head, looking at her pale, hollow-eyed reflection in the mirror, feeling a wave of disgust.\nShe wiped the mirror clean with a tissue, then took out her makeup bag to touch up her face, trying to look a bit better. She reminded herself she couldn't give up. Alvin was still waiting for her to save him. Nora and Bobby might not like her, but she had to support Bobby through college and help cure Nora's illness.\nAs for herself? Victoria smiled bitterly, it didn't matter.\nAfter fixing herself up, Victoria walked out of the restroom and got back to the tasks Ella had given her. But no matter what she did, Ella always found something to criticize and kept making things hard for her.\n\"What kind of organization is this? It's a mess. Do it again and check every file carefully. There can't be any mistakes,\" Ella said harshly.\nJust then, William walked over and glanced at Victoria indifferently, ignoring Ella's harassment.\nSeeing Victoria on the verge of collapse, Harry couldn't take it anymore. He went over to support her and asked, \"Are you okay?\"\nElla immediately mocked, \"Wow, you're good at seducing, huh? Even got William's driver in such a short time.\"\nWilliam heard this and his expression darkened. He gave Victoria a cold look and then told Harry to go run an errand.\nVictoria ignored Ella's taunts and focused on her work. Even though Victoria didn't finish college, she had always been a top student. She majored in art, but her grades were on par with the best students.\nEven after dropping out, she kept taking college courses whenever she could, in accounting, management andanything that could help her at work. That's why she became William's secretary so quickly, not because she was his lover or got special treatment.\nSo in just one morning, she organized the materials perfectly, leaving Ella, who was trying to make things hard for her, with nothing to criticize.\nBut Ella wasn't about to give up. After lunch, she started nitpicking again.\nElla said, \"Go make me a cup of hand-brewed coffee and get my afternoon tea ready.\"\nVictoria did as she was told, trying her best to get every detail right, hoping to satisfy Ella. But Ella was never going to be satisfied.",

        "content": "Ella sneered, \"What kind of coffee is this? It's terrible. And the dessert is disgusting. Even a dog wouldn't touch this.\"\nHer eyes landed on a picture of Victoria and Alvin on Victoria's desk.\nA wicked grin spread across her face as she picked up the photo and said with disdain, \"Victoria, look at your dad. He claims to be the country's top architect? The stadium he built collapsed-luckily, no one died, but the resort hotel he designed ten years ago collapsed and killed dozens. He's a murderer! He only got ten years in prison, but he should've gotten the death penalty-poisoned, electrocuted, shot!\"\nVictoria's eyes flared with anger at Ella's cruel words. She rushed over, snatched the photo, and clutched it to her chest.\nGlaring at Ella, she shouted, \"Shut up! My dad has paid a heavy price for his mistakes. He was sentenced to ten years by the law, and he tried his best to compensate the victims' families. He's trying to make amends for his wrongs. And what about you? Besides throwing your weight around because of your family's background, what meaningful things have you done? Do you think that makes you important? No, you're just a pathetic person with an ugly heart and an empty soul. You have no right to judge my father or his life.\"\nElla was so enraged by Victoria's words that she saw red and snatched the photo frame from Victoria's hands, smashing it to the ground and stomping on it with her high heels.\nVictoria's anger hit its peak as she watched Ella's actions. Unable to take it any longer, she grabbed a pastry and shoved it into Ella's mouth, shouting, \"Your mouth is so foul. This pastry will clean it.\"\nElla was stunned by the sudden action and was about to retaliate when William, already furious, walked over. He picked up a large glass of water from the table and threw it in Victoria's face. Water splashed all over Victoria's face and body, leaving her in a sorry state.\nThen, William slapped Victoria hard across the face, shouting angrily, \"Victoria, who do you think you are? How dare you disrespect my fiancée. What's wrong with what she said? Doesn't a murderer deserve to die?\"\nVictoria was stunned by the water and the slap, her head buzzing. For a moment, time seemed to stand still, and everything around her became blurry.\nTears glistened in her once bright eyes, but she held them back. She raised her head slightly and looked directly at William.\n\"I won't let you insult my father! He's the best architect in my heart,\" she said, her voice hoarse and trembling but full of strength. \"He's designed so many buildings without any issues. I believe there must be other reasons.\"\n\"The court found him fully responsible, and you still want to clear his name? Dream on!\" William's voice was cold, devoid of any warmth, and his gaze at Victoria was full of warning.\nVictoria's body trembled slightly, and she bit her lip until it bled. Her hands clenched into fists, nails digging into her palms, but she felt no pain. She wanted to argue but couldn't find a reason.\nElla, seeing Victoria's sorry state, felt extremely pleased. The feeling of having Victoria under her heel made her both excited and triumphant. \nShe said, \"Victoria, you're just the daughter of a murderer. What if you were almost raped? No one will stand up for you! I don't mind telling you, those four men who tried to rape you only suffered minor injuries. They're fine now, living a wealthy life, enjoying themselves!\"Ella's words dripped with mockery and pride.\nIt wasn't until she finished speaking that she realized she might've slipped up. Her words seemed to confirm to Victoria that she had a hand in that incident. She quickly glanced at William, and seeing no reaction from him, she breathed a sigh of relief.\nVictoria felt like she'd been struck by lightning hearing Ella's words. Her eyes widened in shock and disbelief. Trembling, she murmured, \"How is that possible? How could they have only minor injuries?\"\nHer mind was flooded with the pain and humiliation she had suffered, while those who hurt her walked away unscathed. It felt like an invisible hand was squeezing her heart, making it hard to breathe.\n\"William, didn't you say they had been punished? You're a liar!\" Victoria angrily questioned William.\nWilliam frowned, his expression darkening. \"Victoria, calm down and know your place,\" he said.\n\"I can't calm down! Didn't you tell me they had been arrested?\" Victoria continued to question, her voice trembling with anger. Her voice was like a blade, piercing William's heart.\nHis face darkened further, a flicker of unease in his eyes, but he suppressed it and coldly responded, \"Victoria, don't make me lose my patience with you!\"\nVictoria's heart felt like it was being squeezed, the pain washing over her. Her thoughts raced like a torrent, flooding her with fear and anger.\nThe shadows of the past surged, and memories of being beaten, humiliated, and her helpless struggles in the dark all resurfaced.\n\"You're a liar! A shameless liar!\" she cried out in anguish, her voice hoarse, suffocating in her inability to breathe.\nWilliam frowned slightly, a complex emotion crossing his face.\n\"Victoria!\" he finally spoke, his voice low but commanding, \"You're just someone who sell your body. You have no right to shout at me! If you can't calm down, go reflect downstairs, or I guarantee you'll regret your impulsiveness today!\"\nBy now, it was pouring rain outside, the large raindrops hitting the glass windows with a crisp sound.\nThe rain obscured everything as Victoria stared at William blankly. The hatred in her eyes gradually faded, replaced by deep despair and helplessness.\nVictoria straightened her back, slowly turned, and walked towards the elevator under William's inscrutable gaze. She stepped out into the rain, which quickly soaked her hair and clothes, the cold water running down her cheeks.\nHer already pale face became even more bloodless under the rain, like a sheet of white paper. The five-finger mark on her face was clearly visible. She bit her lip hard, trying to stay conscious of the pain, but her lips were already bloody and raw.\nPassersby hurried by, the rain blurring Victoria's vision, but she could still hear their mocking voices.\n\"Look at that woman, probably a mistress caught by the wife and being punished! Look, she even got slapped!\" a middle-aged woman muttered, her eyes full of disdain.\n\"Maybe she scammed someone and is getting her comeuppance,\" a young man sneered as he walked past Victoria.\nVictoria could only smile bitterly at the mockery.\nThe rain poured harder, soaking her completely, the cold seeping into her body through every pore. Her teeth chattered uncontrollably, and the pain and exhaustion made it hard for her to stand as she trembled in the rain.",

Her vision started getting all fuzzy, and she felt her strength just drain away until she was like a ragdoll.\nEventually, everything went black, and she hit the ground hard, water splashing everywhere. People around her barely even glanced her way and just kept on walking.\nNobody stepped up to help, and it was like no one gave a damn whether she lived or died. The world around her stayed loud and chaotic, while she just lay there quietly in the rain. The rain kept pounding down on her, making her look like some lifeless doll getting battered by the elements.\nRight then, Harry came back from running errands. He spotted Victoria lying there in the rain, and his heart just about stopped. He rushed over, squatted down, and gently called her name.\nBut Victoria didn't respond; she was already out cold. Without thinking twice, Harry took off his coat and covered her with it. He glanced up at the tall figure in the big floor-to-ceiling window on the twentieth floor and sighed. Then he carefully picked her up, put her in the back seat, and sped off to the hospital.\nIn the VIP ward, Victoria's face was flushed, her breathing was fast, and she had a raging fever. Her brows were all scrunched up, like she was stuck in some awful nightmare.\nIn her dream, she was back in that horrible moment when Alvin was taken away. She wanted to save him, but she was helpless.\nThen, she saw the four guys who had tried to rape her, their faces smug and mocking her weakness. She wanted to run, but her feet felt like they were made of lead. She screamed in despair, but no one came to help.\nNext, the scene shifted, and she saw William's cold face and the hand that slapped her hard. Her heart felt like it was being ripped apart, the pain unbearable.\nVictoria kept struggling in her dream, her body trembling slightly, and sweat beads forming on her forehead.\nIn the ward, the faint sounds of medical equipment echoed, and no one knew the hell she was going through in her dream, nor could anyone pull her out of it.\nHarry stayed outside the ward for a bit, watching Victoria's pained expression, feeling a deep sense of pity. He knew he couldn't stay there forever; he had stuff to report to William.\nTaking a deep breath, Harry pulled himself together, and left the hospital. When he got to William's office, he knocked lightly on the door.\nHearing William's low \"come in,\" he slowly pushed the door open.\nThe office reeked of tobacco, making Harry cough. William was sitting at his desk, coldly staring at some documents. His brows were slightly furrowed, his gaze focused and icy.\nHarry hesitated for a moment but then spoke up, \"Mr. Scott, Ms. Carter fainted outside the company. I took her to the hospital.\"\nWilliam slightly raised his head, a flicker of some complex emotion in his eyes, but it quickly turned back to indifference.\nHis gaze landed on Harry, as if he was waiting for more info. \"How is she?\" he asked. His voice was flat, showing no concern at all.\nHarry replied, \"The doctor said she's got a fever, and her condition's pretty unstable. She's having some kind of nightmare, and looks really distressed.\"\nWilliam was quiet for a moment, then coldly said, \"She brought it on herself. She's just a nobody; her life or death means nothing to me.\"\nAfter saying that, he went back to his documents, like Victoria's situation didn't matter at all.\nHarry looked at William's indifferent expression, feeling a bit helpless. He knew the beef between William and Victoria ran deep, but he also thought William was being a bit too harsh.\nHis lips moved, like he wanted to say something, but he didn't know where to start. In the end, he just left the office silently.\nAs he walked out, he sighed lightly. He could only hope William wouldn't regret treating Victoria this way someday.\nAfter who knew how long, Victoria slowly woke up from her stupor. She opened her heavy eyes, and the first thing she saw was the white ceiling and familiar medical equipment.\nHer head was foggy, and her body felt weak and powerless. She tried to remember what had happened, and a wave of bitterness rose in her heart.\nJust then, the door to the ward was suddenly pushed open, and Ella walked in, all high and mighty.\nShe was dressed in fancy clothes, her face full of arrogance. She got straight to the point, pulling out a settlement agreement and tossing it onto Victoria's bed.\n\"Victoria, if you know what's good for you, sign this agreement and drop the whole thing.\" Ella's voice was sharp and cold.\nVictoria looked at the agreement, and her anger flared up. Dragging her sick body, she struggled to sit up and glared at Ella.\n\"Ella, do you think I'll let you off that easy? I'll never forget what you did to me.\" Victoria's voice was weak but filled with determination.\nElla sneered, her eyes full of contempt. \"You'd better know your place. Do you really think you can go up against me? You're nothing but a pathetic insect. Look at you now-you're like a drowned rat,\" she said mockingly, raising her chin slightly as if looking at a lowly creature.\nVictoria's face turned pale, her body trembling slightly. \"Ella, don't push it!\" she said.\nElla, however, was unfazed and kept mocking. \"Push it? What can you do to me? Your dad's a criminal, and you're no better. What right do you have to challenge me? Do you think William cares about your life or death? Stop dreaming. He only keeps you around to amuse himself when he's bored. You pathetic wretch; you only caught William's eye because you look like my sister who's abroad. You're just his plaything. You really think you're something?\" she said.\nHearing this, Victoria bit her lip tightly, using all her strength to point to the door. \"Get out! I don't want to see you again. I'm not signing your damn agreement, so give up!\"\nElla's face turned livid with anger, but she had no choice but to leave the ward. As she walked out, she ran into Bobby, who had come to ask Victoria for money.\nBobby overheard their conversation, and his eyes lit up. He immediately blocked Ella's path, a greedy expression on his face.",

        "content": "\"Are you Ella? If you hand me a million bucks, I'll get Victoria to sign the settlement,\" Bobby said, his voice dripping with greed like he already had the cash in his pocket.\nElla shot him a look of pure disgust. \"You? You're as low as Victoria. Do you even know your own worth? How dare you ask for a million dollars?\"\nBut Bobby wasn't backing down. \"Don't underestimate me. Give me the money, and I promise she'll sign.\"\nHis eyes gleamed with confidence, like he had Victoria wrapped around his finger.\nElla hesitated. She couldn't stand Bobby, but she wanted to get this mess with Victoria over with. \"Fine. I'll give you two hundred grand upfront. Once Victoria signs, you'll get the rest.\"\nBobby's face lit up. \"Deal. You better not back out.\"\nA smug grin spread across his face, as if he was already picturing himself living it up with the money.\nElla pulled a check from her bag and tossed it to him. \"Take it and get to work. Screw this up, and you'll regret it.\"\nBobby grabbed the check, still grinning. He watched Ella walk away, already plotting how to get Victoria to sign. Bobby strolled into the hospital room, seeing Victoria lying weakly on the bed. He didn't show a hint of concern.\nHe tossed the settlement agreement in front of her. \"Victoria, sign this now,\" he demanded, his voice cold and selfish.\nVictoria looked at the agreement, then at Bobby, her eyes filled with disappointment. \"Bobby, I'm not signing this. Forget it.\"\nBobby's face twisted with anger. \"Why are you so stubborn? If you don't sign, how am I supposed to get the rest of the money? I need it for a training camp. Can't you help me out?\"\nHis voice was sharp, and he completely ignored Victoria's condition.\nVictoria sighed. \"Bobby, it's not that I don't want to help, but what she did was awful. I can't just let it go.\"\nBut Bobby wasn't listening. He always thought, thanks to Nora's favoritism, that Victoria should do everything for him.\n\"You're useless. You can't even handle this. Do you know how much effort I've put into this training camp? Can't you think about me for once?\" he snapped, full of blame.\nVictoria's face turned pale with anger. \"Bobby, how can you say that? Haven't I done enough for you? Do you have to drain me dry to be satisfied?\"\nBobby ignored her and kept insulting her. \"You're just a loser. You can't even get the money for my training camp. Stop pretending to be noble. Sign the agreement now, or I'll get Mom to deal with you.\"\nVictoria looked at his twisted, ugly sneer, her heart sinking. She never thought someone so close could treat her this way. She closed her eyes, not wanting to see him anymore. But Bobby, seeing Victoria ignoring him, got even more pissed.\nHe grabbed her arm and shook her hard. \"Did you hear me? Sign it now!\"\nHis actions were rough, showing zero compassion. Victoria, dizzy from the shaking, used all her strength to break free. \"Bobby, get out! I won't sign this agreement.\"\nBobby was about to keep at it, but luckily, the doctor and nurse rushed in after hearing the commotion.\nBobby shot Victoria a nasty glare and stormed out, slamming the door behind him.\nThe doctor looked at Victoria, all disheveled and worn out, and sighed. \"Ms. Carter, things will get better.\"\nVictoria forced a bitter smile and thanked him for his kindness.\nWilliam, being generous for once, gave Victoria five days of sick leave, telling her to rest up and not look so sickly, as it would affect the Scott Group's image.\nThe VIP hospital room was top-notch, spacious, and bright.\nVictoria sat on the wicker chair on the balcony, staring blankly at the beautiful scenery outside. It was late autumn, and the trees and flowers had withered, but the mountain behind the hospital was still lush and vibrant.\nThis was the life of the wealthy, while Victoria felt like just an ordinary person who had taken a wrong turn.\nVictoria stayed in the hospital for two days, during which Nora came up from the regular ward downstairs several times.\nFacing Victoria's uncooperative attitude, Nora was anxious and impatient. \"Victoria, sign that agreement quickly! Bobby's future depends on this. You can't be so selfish and only think about yourself. Bobby is the hope of our family. Can't you sacrifice a little for him? If you don't sign, you'll ruin Bobby and our family's future.\"\nBefore Victoria could respond, Bobby also rushed into the room, shouting angrily. \"Victoria, how can you be so ungrateful? If you don't sign the agreement, what will I do? If I can't go to the training camp, my future will be ruined. You just can't stand to see me doing well. You've never cared about me. If you have any conscience, sign the agreement now and stop ruining my life.\"\nSeeing Nora's and Bobby's relentless pestering, Victoria was completely disheartened. Unable to bear it any longer, she decided to call the police.\nThe police quickly arrived at the hospital to file a report. A female officer named Luna Bailey sat by Victoria's bed, carefully asking about the situation.\n\"Ms. Carter, don't worry. Tell us what happened in detail,\" Luna's voice was steady and reassuring.\nVictoria tried to calm down and began to recount her ordeal. \"A few days ago, at the Starry Nights Hotel, I was almost...\"\nShe told the police everything that happened that night in detail.\nLuna then sent her colleagues to the Starry Nights Hotel to check the surveillance footage, only to find that all the records from those days were gone. The hotel explained that they had been hit by a virus. Although everyone knew something was fishy, the police couldn't do much about it.\nLuna frowned slightly. \"Do you have any suspects?\" she asked.\nVictoria bit her lip and said, \"I think it might be Ella.\"\nWhy she didn't mention William's name, even Victoria herself might not know.",

        "content": "Luna thought for a second and said, \"We don't have any solid proof right now, so we can't jump to conclusions. But don't worry, we'll dig into this and find some leads. Can you tell us anything about the guys who tried to attack you?\"\nVictoria, who was a natural at drawing, quickly sketched out the faces of the men.\nLuna checked out the drawings, clearly impressed. \"Ms. Carter, these are super helpful. We'll use them to kick off our investigation and track these guys down ASAP. You just focus on getting better and wait for our updates.\"\nFeeling a bit more at ease, Victoria said, \"Officer Bailey, thank you so much.\"\nLuna replied seriously, \"We'll do everything we can to investigate. You need to stay safe too. If you notice anything weird, call us right away. We'll keep on this case and make sure you get justice.\"\n\"Okay, thank you,\" Victoria said again.\nAfter the cops left, Victoria didn't want to see Nora and Bobby anymore and left the hospital right away. With her heart pounding, Victoria headed to the prison to visit Alvin.\nIn the visiting room, she nervously rubbed her hands, waiting for Alvin to show up. When the door on the other side of the glass opened, revealing that familiar figure, tears welled up in her eyes.\nAlvin appeared older than she remembered; his hair had turned gray, and his face showed signs of weariness and worry. When he saw Victoria, his eyes lit up. He eagerly picked up the phone and asked, \"Victoria, why are you here?\"\nTrying to hold back her tears, Victoria smiled and said, \"Dad, I just missed you and wanted to see you.\"\nAlvin's eyes were full of pain. \"Victoria, you have to take good care of yourself since I'm not there with you. Don't let anyone mistreat you, okay?\" he said.\nVictoria nodded, tears welling up. \"Dad, I know. You take care of yourself in there too. I'll try to get the money together to get you out as soon as I can.\"\nAlvin's eyes reddened, and he looked worried. He said, \"Victoria, don't worry about me. Just take care of yourself.\"\nVictoria's heart ached seeing Alvin's once-confident and handsome face now pale and thin. After calming down, she decided to ask the question that had been on her mind for a long time. \"Dad, can you tell me about the gym collapse and the bridge collapse ten years ago? I really want to know.\"\nHearing this, Alvin was a bit taken aback, his expression complicated. He said, \"Victoria, I was the designer for both projects, and I am confident in them. I have thoroughly reviewed and verified every detail. After the police investigation, they said the materials and construction were fine, but an expert claimed it was a design issue. Since he said so, it must be my lack of skill. You shouldn't dig into it further.\"\nVictoria frowned and said, \"Dad, this is too weird.\"\nAlvin sighed, \"Victoria, some things aren't as simple as they seem. Both accidents had a lot of factors, not something that can be explained in a few words. Don't get yourself into trouble, just live your life.\"\nVictoria wasn't ready to give up. \"Dad, I just feel something's off. I want to know what really happened. Please tell me.\"\nAlvin looked at Victoria seriously and said, \"Victoria, listen to me. Don't get involved in this. Your priority now is to take care of yourself and plan for your future. Don't take risks.\"\nSeeing the determination in Alvin's eyes, Victoria knew he wouldn't say more. She nodded reluctantly and said, \"Dad, I understand. I'll take good care of myself.\"\nThey talked about some everyday stuff, which, although ordinary, felt especially precious at that moment. Time flew by, and the visiting time was almost up.\nAlvin looked at Victoria with reluctance and said, \"Victoria, take care of yourself and live for yourself. Nora and Bobby...\"He suddenly stopped, hesitating whether to continue.\n\"What about them?\" Victoria sensed something was up and asked urgently.\nBut Alvin shook his head, indicating he had nothing more to say, and waved her off.\nVictoria was filled with doubts, feeling there was more to Alvin's words.\nAs the visiting bell rang, she slowly put down the phone. She watched Alvin being led away by the guards, her heart heavy with sorrow.\nVictoria headed to the Scott Group, where the familiar yet oppressive atmosphere felt like a suffocating net. Her mood was heavy and complicated because she had decided to end this chaotic relationship.\nAlvin's debt could be repaid slowly, and she would find another way to deal with Nora's illness, but she could no longer force herself to beg William.\nWilliam never treated Victoria like a human being.\nAlvin was right; Victoria should live for herself.\nWilliam walked over with steady steps, his face cold as ice. His gaze swept over Victoria indifferently, as if she were just a speck of dust, insignificant.\nHe slightly raised his chin and said coldly, \"Get ready to go with me to inspect Kirk's company.\"\nVictoria stood there, a complex emotion rising in her heart. She looked at William's cold back, bit her lip, and mustered the courage to say, \"Mr. Scott, I have something to say.\"\nHearing this, William stopped, slightly turned his head, and a trace of impatience flashed in his eyes. \"What is it?\" he asked.\nVictoria took a deep breath and said slowly, \"Mr. Scott, I want to resign and terminate our financial support agreement involving a sexual relationship. I'll find a way to repay this month's money.\"\nWilliam felt a surge of anger and glared at Victoria. He said, \"Do you think you have the right to say this to me?\"\nVictoria straightened her back and met William's gaze fearlessly. She responded, \"Mr. Scott, I get it-I'm like a little ant to you, one of the rich and powerful. But I have my own dignity and dreams. I don't want to be controlled by you anymore.\"\nWilliam's lips curled into a cruel smile. \"What dignity do you have in front of me? You're just my sexual release tool. What about your mother's medical bills? Your brother's tuition? Your father's debt?\" he said.\nVictoria's heart ached slightly, but she remained firm. \"Mr. Scott, whether I take care of them or not is none of your business. I've made up my mind. I'm not here to seek your approval, just to inform you.\"\nWilliam slammed his hand down on the table so hard that the papers scattered everywhere. He glared at her and growled, \"Don't you dare!\"\nVictoria's body trembled slightly, but she stubbornly said, \"Mr. Scott, this is a society governed by law.\"\nWilliam was completely enraged by Victoria's defiance. He suddenly rushed forward, grabbing Victoria's arm with such force it felt like he would crush her bones.\nHe roughly dragged her towards himself. Victoria struggled in terror, but William's strength was overwhelming, and she couldn't break free.\nWilliam dragged her into the small compartment in the office and slammed the door shut. He stared at Victoria intensely, stepping closer to her with each powerful, oppressive step.\nVictoria kept retreating until her back was against the wall.\nWithout hesitation, William grabbed Victoria's collar and yanked hard. The buttons of her shirt popped off, revealing her smooth skin, which looked especially vulnerable under the dim light.\nVictoria cried out in despair, \"William, let me go! This is illegal!\"\nWilliam seemed to have lost his mind. His fingers lightly traced Victoria's cheek, carrying a burning temperature.\nHe lowered his head slightly, his breath hot and erratic near Victoria's ear. \"Do you think you can just come and go as you please? Do you take me for a merciful person?\"\nAs he spoke, he pressed Victoria onto the desk, kissing her neck and cheeks frantically.\nVictoria struggled desperately, trying to break free from his grip, but her strength was insignificant compared to his.\nWilliam's hands roamed freely over Victoria's body, tearing at her clothes. The fabric in his hands was as fragile as paper, quickly shredding into pieces. He turned Victoria around, lifted her leg to his waist, and pressed himself tightly against her entrance.",

        "content": "Victoria fought like hell, but William's grip was way too strong for her to break free.\nWithout any foreplay, he thrust into her forcefully, moving recklessly. Victoria's mind went blank from the pain, almost paralyzing her. Her fingertips dug deeply into William's shoulders, tears streaming down her face.\nSeeing this, William got even angrier. \"Why are you acting all pitiful? Aren't you enjoying this?\" His movements got rougher as he spoke.\nHe gripped her waist tightly with one hand, while the other hand squeezed her buttocks, occasionally slapping them hard.\nVictoria groaned in pain but gritted her teeth and took it.\n\"Victoria, you better behave, and I'll let you go when I'm done!\" William threatened, his tone ice-cold.\nVictoria bit her lip, holding back any sound, but her eyes were already red and swollen.\nSeeing this, William got even angrier. He used all his strength to torment her. Victoria's body convulsed, tears falling like broken beads.\nWilliam's breathing got heavier. He picked up Victoria and threw her onto the nearby bed, turning her over so she was facing away from him. He then lifted her butt, making it easier for him to move in and out.\nVictoria bit her lip, enduring his assault, already crying uncontrollably.\nLooking at Victoria's pale face and fragile figure, William suddenly felt something stir inside him, making him soften for a moment. His movements then became gentler. He turned her over, squeezed her breasts, and slowly massaged them before burying his head in them, his lips and tongue lingering on her chest.\nVictoria felt a wave of uncontrollable desire surge through her body, making her both ashamed and in pain. She thought, 'How could I feel this way when I'm being forced?'\nWilliam kept smacking Victoria's delicate private parts, sometimes lightly, sometimes heavily, occasionally nibbling on her nipples.\nVictoria's body trembled involuntarily. She twisted her waist uneasily, clamping her legs tightly, trying to block William's advances.\nSeeing this, William got even more excited. His movements became more vigorous, as if he wanted to completely dominate her.\nVictoria fainted several times from his torment. When she woke up, her body was exhausted and in pain. She lay on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling with empty eyes.\nWilliam stood by the window smoking, the smoke lingering in front of the glass. His brows were tightly furrowed, his handsome yet sinister face partially obscured by the hazy smoke, making it hard to see clearly.\nHe saw Victoria wake up, and his pupils contracted as he quickly put out the cigarette.\nVictoria trembled as she picked up the torn clothes on the floor, wrapping them tightly around herself, then put on the crumpled coat. Her eyes were cold, like ice, devoid of any emotion.\nLooking at William, Victoria said hoarsely but firmly, \"Mr. Scott, no matter what you do to me, I won't change my decision.\"\nWilliam seemed to calm down a bit. Looking at Victoria's stubborn face, he felt a surge of complex emotions.\nAfter a moment of silence, he said coldly, \"Fine, since you're so determined, I agree. From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.\"\nHearing William's words, Victoria felt a mix of relief and an odd sense of loss. But she knew this was the path she had to take. She silently turned around and walked out under William's intense gaze.\nWilliam stood there, watching her leave, his eyes filled with deep and complex emotions.\nAfter leaving the Scott Group, Victoria felt like a huge weight had been lifted off her shoulders. She wandered through the busy supermarket, carefully picking out fresh vegetables and fruits.\nThinking of Elara's kindness and support, she decided to cook a special meal for her. Back at her place, Victoria got busy. She laid out the ingredients on the kitchen counter: fresh greens, red tomatoes, plump mushrooms, all looking vibrant and delicious.\nShe tied on her apron, washed her hands, and got ready to whip up a feast. She skillfully picked up a knife and started chopping vegetables.\nHearing the noise, Elara came into the kitchen and smiled. \"Victoria, let me help you out.\"\nVictoria smiled back and said, \"Elara, since I'm the one inviting you today, there's no way I'm letting you help.\"\nElara waved her hand and said, \"It's fine. If we do it together, it'll be faster.\"\nSoon, the kitchen was filled with mouth-watering aromas, and a variety of delicious dishes were laid out on the table.\nVictoria made several home-cooked dishes: glossy roasted chicken, sweet and sour tomato pasta, colorful beef bourguignon, and mushroom soup.\nElara's face lit up with a smile when she saw the spread, and she couldn't help but praise. \"Victoria, your cooking skills are amazing.\"\nVictoria blushed and then invited Elara to sit down and taste her cooking.\nElara sat at the table, tasting Victoria's dishes, and kept praising. \"This is really delicious! Your cooking skills are as good as a restaurant chef's.\"\nVictoria laughed and responded, \"Oh, you're too kind!\"\nThe two enjoyed the food and chatted happily.\nAs they ate, Elara sighed, \"Victoria, your cooking is so good. I wish my son could taste it. He's a lawyer, always traveling for work. Sometimes it's hard to get him to come home for a meal.\"\nHearing this, Victoria gently comforted, \"Being busy is a good thing for young people; it shows he has ambition.\"\n\"That's true, but I still worry about his health and wish he could spend more time with me!\" Elara sighed, then asked, \"Victoria, I noticed you used to be very busy, often working late into the night. It's not the weekend today, so how do you have time to invite me to dinner?\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes, hiding the sadness in them, \"Actually, I quit my job.\"\n\"Quit? That's good!\" Elara looked at Victoria with concern and said, \"I noticed you always came home late and left early, often looking sickly. Your job didn't treat you well. Look at you, so weak and thin. It's good to change jobs, don't wear yourself out.\"\nSaying this, Elara put some food into Victoria's bowl. \"Eat more, you're too thin.\"\nVictoria felt warmth in her heart, and her eyes moistened. \"Elara, thank you,\" she said.\n\"By the way, what are your plans for the future?\" Elara asked with concern.\nVictoria hesitated for a moment, then said, \"I've reached out to a real estate company. They offer decent pay and don't care much about education. You know, I didn't finish college...\"",

        "content": "Victoria figured that even though Alvin's company had tanked, she still had some old connections. If she could just push past the awkwardness and hustle, she might be able to make some sales.\nAt least she could still cover Nora's medical bills and Bobby's tuition. Thinking about the ungrateful Nora and selfish Bobby, Victoria had thought about just cutting them off, but she couldn't bring herself to do it. She was just too soft-hearted.\nElara noticed her looking a bit unsure and felt really bad for such a sweet and sensible girl who had to deal with so much.\nShe grabbed Victoria's hand and said, \"Victoria, don't sell yourself short. You're smart and beautiful. Don't lose hope. I have a job that would be perfect for you. Would you consider it?\"\n\"That's too much trouble for you!\" Victoria shook her head. She didn't want to be a burden to Elara.\nElara patted her hand and smiled, \"It's no trouble at all! I'm just giving you a chance. Whether you make it or not is up to you.\"\nShe went on, \"I have a friend who owns an art gallery and is hiring. You have a knack for painting, so working there would be great. The pay's decent, the environment is nice, and you'll be around people who love art. You'll get to see all kinds of beautiful pieces and meet artists and collectors. It's a great opportunity for you. You can definitely shine there.\"\nVictoria was interested but still worried. She said, \"But Elara, I don't have much education. I'm afraid I'll embarrass you if I go there.\"\nElara waved her hand and said confidently, \"How could you embarrass me? I'm just making the introduction. They hire ten interns each time, but only keep two. It's up to you to earn your spot.\"\nHearing this, Victoria thought for a while and realized that working at the gallery was indeed better than selling real estate. She had been painting since she was a kid and knew a bit about famous and up-and-coming artists.\nPlus, even though Nora didn't like her, Victoria had been around art sales since she was young and knew quite a bit about it.\nIf she worked hard and learned more, she should be able to handle the job. Thinking of this, she didn't refuse anymore and nodded. \"Okay, I'll give it a shot.\"\nElara immediately smiled and said, \"Great, I'll take you there tomorrow.\"\n\"Elara, I'll go by myself,\" Victoria quickly said. \"I can't trouble you.\"\nBut Elara insisted, \"No way, you're my recommendation. I have to support you.\"\nVictoria couldn't argue with her, so she agreed.\nThe next day, Victoria put on a professional suit and light makeup to cover her pale face. Feeling a bit nervous, she followed Elara to the gallery.\nThe gallery was on a quiet street, in a unique white building with a geometric design. Large floor-to-ceiling windows acted like transparent mirrors, letting sunlight flood the interior and light up the exquisite artworks. The walls were decked out with all kinds of paintings, from classic pieces by famous artists like Claude Monet's \"Impression Sunrise\" to fresh, innovative works by up-and-comers like Joshua Thomas.\nBesides the paintings, the gallery also had some stunning sculptures on display.\nVictoria was carefully admiring a painting, trying to soak up some inspiration, when a young woman with an elegant vibe and a stern face walked up to her.\nThe woman's shiny blonde hair was neatly tied back, and her delicate face was framed by black-rimmed glasses, giving her an intellectual look. She was Diana Simpson, Elara's friend's daughter, who now ran the gallery.\nElara warmly introduced Victoria to Diana. \"Diana, this is Victoria. I've told you about her. She's a talented painter and is hoping to start working here.\"\nDiana's face immediately lit up with a warm smile when she saw Elara. She kindly shook Victoria's hand and said, \"Welcome to our gallery, Victoria. I've heard about you from Elara. It's nice to meet you.\"\nSeeing Diana's enthusiasm, Elara felt reassured. She turned to Victoria and said, \"Victoria, do your best here. If you have any questions, just ask Diana.\"\nWith that, Elara got ready to leave the gallery. But as soon as Elara turned around, Diana's expression turned cold. She looked Victoria up and down with a mix of disdain and skepticism.\nVictoria's smile froze for a moment, and she lowered her eyes slightly, politely saying, \"Hello, Ms. Simpson.\"\n\"Hello,\" Diana replied indifferently. \"Were you just admiring this painting, 'Song of the Valley'?\"\n\"Yes,\" Victoria answered honestly.\n\"What do you like about it?\" Diana asked.\n\"The technique is excellent, the composition is profound, and the colors are perfectly matched,\" Victoria said sincerely.\nDiana said, \"You have some insight, but Starry Studio Gallery is one of the top galleries in the country. We only hire graduates from prestigious schools. Do you think you have what it takes to succeed here?\"\nShe stared coldly at Victoria, not hiding her contempt and mockery. Victoria's heart sank. She knew Diana had agreed to let her intern only because of Elara's request, not because Diana valued her.\nIt was understandable. If she were Diana, she wouldn't want to waste time and effort evaluating someone who hadn't even attended college.\nThere might have been hidden talents among the general public, but the chances were slim. Top universities tended to concentrate more outstanding individuals. Even if someone possessed undiscovered talents, without a degree from a reputable university, the company didn't have the time to seek one out.\nVictoria pressed her lips together and calmly looked up at Diana, saying, \"I understand your concerns. But since Elara got me this opportunity, I still want to try. If I don't meet your standards, I will leave on my own without causing any trouble.\"",

She hadn't expected this seemingly gentle and fragile girl to have such courage. A mocking smile curled at the corner of her lips as she thought, 'This little girl really thinks she can take on the world. Fine, let's see what she's got.'\nThen, with a nonchalant air, she spoke, \"If you want to go down this path, I won't stop you. Follow me.\"\nVictoria let out a sigh of relief, knowing she had cleared the first hurdle.\nDiana gathered all the interns, crossing her arms and giving them a cold once-over. \"I've brought you all here to get acquainted. You'll be interning together and competing for the only two permanent spots,\" she said, her voice icy and detached.\nThe interns stood at attention, anxiously waiting for the introductions to start.\nDiana gave a slight nod, signaling the first person to begin.\nA tall, striking girl stepped forward, lifting her chin confidently. \"I'm Wendy Clark, a graduate of Rainbow Creative University. I've been painting since I was a kid, diving into traditional techniques and exploring new artistic expressions. I'm excited to learn more at Starry Studio Gallery.\"\nHer intro got a few nods of admiration, and everyone looked at her with respect.\nNext up was a calm, bespectacled young man. \"Hey everyone, I'm Irvin Hays, a graduate of the University of Aesthetics Shine. I'm into modern art and have worked on several international projects with my mentor. If I get to stay at Starry Studio Gallery, I'll give it my all.\" His intro also earned some recognition and praise.\nThe interns took turns introducing themselves, most of them from top art schools, brimming with pride and confidence.\nWhen it was Victoria's turn, she felt the scrutinizing eyes on her. Taking a deep breath, she introduced herself as calmly as she could, \"Hi everyone, I'm Victoria Carter. I didn't graduate from a fancy art school, just high school, but I have a strong passion for painting. I'll work hard to learn and contribute here.\"\nAfter her intro, the room fell silent for a moment before a few low chuckles broke the stillness. Someone whispered, \"A high school grad interning here? Is this a joke?\" \nAnother added, \"Yeah, this is a professional gallery. What could she possibly know?\"\nThe looks of disdain and the sneers from the people around her made Victoria's cheeks feel like they were on fire, while their judgments felt like needles stabbing her heart.\nDiana's lips curled into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, intros are done. From now on, everyone needs to give it their all. Anyone who falls short is out,\" she said before turning and leaving the interns to whisper among themselves.\nAcross the street from the gallery, a black Maybach was parked. William sat in the driver's seat, watching the distant Starry Studio Gallery through the rearview mirror.\n\"Mr. Scott, Ms. Carter is about to officially join this gallery. Are you really not going to stop her?\" Harry asked.\nWilliam withdrew his gaze and looked at Harry in the passenger seat, speaking slowly, \"No need, she won't get the job.\"\nHarry asked again, \"But what if she does get the job?\"\n\"Does she think she can shake me off that easily? Not a chance,\" William sneered. \"Get in touch with the head of the Simpson family. I have some business to discuss.\"\nHarry was taken aback for a moment before he reacted, feeling a pang of worry for Victoria and shaking his head slightly.\nVictoria and the other interns started their training.\nDuring this process, the trainer scored the interns, and after the training, the five with the lowest scores were cut. Only those who made it through could start the actual internship. It was tough, but most people thought it was fair.\nOn the first day of training, they gathered in the conference room of Starry Studio Gallery.\nFrank, an experienced and knowledgeable art appraisal expert, was the trainer. He kicked things off by introducing the history of Starry Studio Gallery, then shifted the focus to practical work training.\nThe hands-on training started with the layout of the exhibition hall.\nFrank took the interns to the gallery's exhibition hall and explained in detail how to arrange the layout according to different artworks and exhibition themes.\n\"The layout of the exhibition hall should consider the style, color, and size of the works so that visitors can feel the artistic atmosphere the moment they enter,\" he said, showing them how it was done.\nVictoria watched Frank's every move closely, silently noting the key points.\nWhen it was the interns' turn to practice, Wendy confidently pointed to a spot slightly to the right in the middle and said, \"This painting should go here to better highlight its colors.\"\nOther interns chimed in with their opinions, but most weren't much different from Wendy's.\nFrank then looked at Victoria, who had been quiet, and asked, \"What do you think?\"\nVictoria pursed her lips and stepped forward. She looked around and then said to Frank, \"I think this painting would also look good in that corner, creating a dialogue with the sculpture next to it.\"\nHearing this, Wendy glanced at Victoria with slight disdain and said, \"What do you know? I studied professional exhibition layout in school. You're just a high school graduate, so don't make random suggestions.\"\nVictoria's face turned slightly red, but she didn't back down and continued to insist on her point of view. \"Although I don't have a professional background, I believe art is diverse, and different layouts can bring different effects.\"\nSome interns sided with Wendy, while others thought Victoria's idea had some merit, and they began to argue.\nFrank was quite surprised by Victoria, and her layout did have a unique beauty. However, he didn't speak up; he just listened carefully to the interns' debate.\nAfter a while, he smiled and said, \"It's good that everyone has their own ideas. We can try different layouts and see which one works best.\"\nIn the end, with everyone's efforts, the exhibition hall was arranged very well. The painting ended up being placed according to Wendy's suggestion, which was neither remarkable nor incorrect.\nVictoria's opinion, however, went unnoticed.",

        "content": "Next up was customer reception training. Frank really hammered home the importance of good manners and a positive attitude to the interns. He said, \"Always keep a smile on your face and greet every customer with enthusiasm and professionalism. Be proactive in asking about their needs and give them personalized service.\"\nHe even set up some role-playing scenarios so the interns could practice talking to customers.\nVictoria was a bit jittery at first, but with more practice, she started to get the hang of it.\nThis time, Irvin played the customer and threw some tough questions at Victoria. \"Why is this painting so expensive? Is it really worth the price?\" he asked.\nVictoria smiled politely and said, \"The price of a painting depends on several factors. This artist is very famous and has achieved a lot in the art world. Plus, the technique is top-notch and the subject matter is unique. I think true art lovers can see its value.\"\nIrvin kept pushing, \"But what if I think this painting doesn't match my home decor?\"\nVictoria paused for a moment and then said, \"We have a variety of styles in our gallery. What's your home decor like? I can suggest some pieces that might fit better.\"\nHer answer wasn't perfect, but it was pretty good for an intern.\nFrank was impressed with Victoria's performance and gave her high marks.\nNext was the artwork explanation training, which was also super important.\nFrank picked out a few key pieces to show how to explain them to customers. He said, \"When you're explaining a piece, you should talk about the artist's background, their creative style, and the theme of the work. This helps customers understand its meaning and value better...\"\nFrank's explanations were clear and insightful, and the interns learned a lot. Victoria listened carefully, jotting down notes in her notebook.\nDuring the practice session, Victoria asked Wendy for help with an abstract painting. She said, \"Wendy, I don't really get this painting. Can you share your thoughts with me?\"\nWendy was a bit hesitant at first, but she saw how sincere Victoria was and patiently explained, \"This painting is an abstract expressionist piece. The artist uses colors and lines to express inner emotions and thoughts. See, the vibrant colors here show the artist's passion.\"\nVictoria listened intently, asking questions now and then.\nWendy realized that even though Victoria was just out of high school, she had a keen eye for art and often noticed details others missed. Victoria's clear thinking and ability to connect the dots impressed Wendy.\nVictoria was also pleasantly surprised that Wendy, who seemed so proud, was genuinely helpful, which made her warm up to Wendy. Their interactions became more and more enjoyable.\nAfter the lesson, Victoria thanked Wendy.\n\"Thanks a lot, Wendy!\" Victoria said gratefully, \"I really learned a lot from you today.\"\nWendy waved it off and said, \"No problem, let's help each other out.\"\nKnowing she had a lot to learn, Victoria worked even harder to make the most of every learning opportunity. After each day's training, Victoria would hang back in the conference room to go over what she had learned. At home, she'd dive into art books and magazines to expand her knowledge. \nBefore she knew it, the weekend rolled around, and Wendy told her about an art exhibition featuring works by the up-and-coming artist Joshua.\nVictoria was super excited about this since she had always admired Joshua's work. With some free time on her hands, she decided to check out the art museum on her own.\nIn the spacious, well-lit exhibition hall, beautiful paintings hung on the white walls, each one telling its own captivating story.\nVictoria was completely drawn in by these works and eagerly started to appreciate them. She stood quietly in front of a painting that had a strong visual impact, with bold colors and a unique composition that created a powerful effect.\nVictoria quickly pulled out her notebook and jotted down her impressions: [The colors are vibrant and full of energy, and the composition is unique, giving a strong visual impact.]\nAs she wrote, she closely observed every detail of the painting, trying to understand the artist's creative intentions.\nNext, she moved on to another of Joshua's works, which had a totally different vibe-a sunset over the ocean, with golden light shimmering on the waves, creating an unparalleled beauty.\nWith delicate brushstrokes and soft colors, it created a peaceful and warm atmosphere.\nVictoria picked up her notebook again and wrote: [Delicate brushstrokes, soft colors, creating a peaceful and warm atmosphere. The artist's emotions flow gently through the painting, bringing a sense of inner tranquility.]\nShe was so immersed in the world of the paintings that she completely lost track of time and ignored the figure quietly appearing beside her.\nShe looked up and saw a man who appeared to be in his late twenties. He had a lean build and a light stubble on his face, giving him a mature and charming look.\nHe wore a simple yet elegant white shirt with the sleeves slightly rolled up, revealing his strong arms and giving off a vibe of casual elegance.\nVictoria noticed his slightly worn nails, a sign of long hours spent with art supplies. His slightly messy hair perfectly complemented his artistic aura, making him seem lively and unrestrained.\n\"Do you like this painting? You've been standing here for a while,\" he said with a slight smile, his voice deep and magnetic, giving off a warm and friendly vibe.\nHearing his words, Victoria was momentarily stunned, then politely responded, \"Yes, this painting brings a sense of inner peace, making past troubles seem like fleeting clouds, leaving only a longing for beauty.\"\nHe chuckled softly at her response and said, \"Your thoughts are quite unique.\"\nVictoria smiled shyly.\n\"My name is Samuel Brown,\" he introduced himself, extending a friendly hand. \"May I have the honor of knowing your name?\" he asked.",

        "content": "\"Hello, I'm Victoria,\" she said, giving Samuel a polite handshake before letting go.\n\"Are you an art school student?\" Samuel asked.\nVictoria's smile faltered, and she awkwardly shook her head. \"Nope, I didn't go to college. I'm already working, interning at a gallery.\"\nSamuel gave her a thoughtful look and then smiled. \"Skipping college isn't a big deal. It's what you do that counts. You seem really into painting. Our University of Aesthetics Shine has some public lectures every week. You might find them interesting.\"\n\"Really?\" Victoria's heart was instantly flooded with excitement. The University of Aesthetics Shine was the kind of place every art student dreamed of getting into!\nBut just as quickly, her expression fell. \"The university doesn't allow outsiders. Even if I wanted to go, I couldn't get in.\"\nSamuel chuckled. \"Don't worry about it. I'm a professor there. If you really want to attend, I can get you a pass.\"\nVictoria looked at him in surprise, not expecting him to be a professor. She quickly composed herself and said, \"Thank you, but wouldn't that be too much trouble?\"\n\"No need to refuse. I appreciate talent, and it's just a small favor,\" Samuel said with a hearty laugh.\nVictoria's face broke into a big smile as she nodded gratefully. \"Thank you so much! Can I treat you to a meal to show my appreciation?\" she asked.\n\"I'd be delighted!\" Samuel agreed without hesitation.\nAs they walked out of the art gallery, Victoria suddenly felt dizzy, and her vision began to blur. She tried to steady herself, but her body swayed uncontrollably, and she was about to faint.\nSeeing this, Samuel quickly supported her. \"Are you feeling unwell?\" he asked with concern.\nVictoria weakly replied, \"I might be having a hypoglycemic episode; I'm feeling a bit lightheaded.\"\nWithout a word, Samuel ran out of the gallery and soon returned with some candy and drinks. He handed them to Victoria and said, \"Eat something. You'll feel better.\"\nVictoria gratefully took the candy and drinks and started eating. After a while, her color gradually returned, and she felt much better.\nThey then had a quick meal at a nearby restaurant. After leaving the restaurant, Samuel noticed that Victoria still didn't look well and said worriedly, \"I should take you home. What if you faint again on the way?\"\nVictoria didn't want to trouble anyone, but given her current condition, she reluctantly agreed. So, Samuel drove Victoria to her apartment complex.\nAfter getting out of the car, Victoria smiled and thanked Samuel. Once Samuel drove away, Victoria slowly walked towards her building.\nUnbeknownst to her, William was sitting in the back seat of a black Maybach, staring intently at Victoria and Samuel through the window. It was as if his gaze could burn right through the glass.\nHe got out of the car and walked straight towards Victoria. Victoria was unlocking the door when she heard hurried footsteps behind her. She turned around in confusion and saw William standing there. Her eyes widened in fear, and she instinctively tried to run. But terror overwhelmed her, and her legs turned to jelly.\n\"Trying to escape? Too late,\" William said, grabbing Victoria's arm.\nVictoria struggled desperately and shouted, \"Let go of me! What do you want?\"\nWilliam wrapped an arm around her waist, pushed the door open with the other, and dragged her inside, slamming the door shut behind them.\n\"William, are you crazy? Let go of me, or I'll scream for help!\" Victoria struggled angrily, but William's grip was like iron, giving her no chance to resist.\n\"Who was the guy who brought you home?\" William asked coldly, squinting at her.\n\"What does it matter to you?\" Victoria snapped, using all her strength to break free from his grip. She took a few steps back, watching him warily.\n\"How does it not matter to me?\" William cornered her, lifted her chin, and forced her to look into his eyes. \"How dare you flirt with another man? Do you have a death wish?\" he pressed.\nVictoria shivered in fear and gritted her teeth. \"I've told you before, we're done!\"\n\"Done?\" William's lips curled into a sinister smile. He grabbed her neck and pinned her against the cold, hard wall. \"I just accepted your resignation. Did I ever agree to end our deal? You'll never get rid of me! I bought you, and I'll do whatever I want with you. Unless I get bored, you can forget about leaving!\"\nWith that, he tore Victoria's dress apart.\n\"No!\" Victoria screamed, trying to stop him, but it was futile. Her delicate skin was exposed to the air, glistening enticingly.\nA flash of desire crossed William's eyes, and his breathing grew heavier. He lowered his head and took her tender nipple into his mouth.\nVictoria winced in pain, curling her legs and clutching her chest. \"William, please, don't!\" she sobbed, pleading.\n\"You're mine. Why can't I touch you?\" William sneered, his hands roaming over her body.\nTears streamed down Victoria's face. She cried out, \"It's not like that!\"\nWilliam responded, \"Then tell me, what is it like?\" He lowered his head, kissing every inch of her tender skin.\nVictoria was mortified, desperately trying to escape, but she couldn't break free from William, who bit her smooth skin like a beast, leaving a row of deep red teeth marks.\nWhen his lips reached her most sensitive spot, Victoria broke down again, her eyes empty and hopeless.\n\"William, let me go, please!\" Victoria cried, begging.\n\"Why should I let you go?\" William sneered. \"What right do you have to defy me?\"\nWith that, he pushed Victoria onto the sofa, tore off his tie, and roughly tied her flailing hands. He kissed Victoria's inner thighs more aggressively, leaving a trail of intimate marks.\nVictoria closed her eyes in pain, tears streaming down her delicate cheeks. Her eyes widened, and she pounded on his strong chest.\nBut William didn't care. He unbuttoned his shirt, revealing his muscular chest. His long fingers slid under her skirt, caressing her supple skin. Slowly, he pulled down her panties.",

        "content": "Victoria shut her eyes in despair, a single tear slipping down her cheek.\nWilliam unzipped his pants, letting his hot, erect member free, and slowly entered her. Victoria's body went rigid, trembling even more. Her hands clenched into fists, nails digging into her skin, drawing thin lines of blood.\nWilliam enjoyed her body with a satisfied grin, panting, \"Victoria, remember, your body is mine. You can't escape.\"\nHearing this, Victoria was filled with hatred. She suddenly bit down on his shoulder.\nWilliam grunted but didn't pull away. Moments later, he pulled out and then thrust back in harder, whispering in her ear, \"Isn't this exciting? I love seeing you get aroused because of me.\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together, staying silent. She'd rather endure the physical and mental torment than let William see her vulnerable.\nWilliam sensed her stubbornness and got even angrier. He thrust forcefully, sending his large, erect member deep inside her.\nVictoria felt a surge of electricity spread through her body, arching her back and moaning.\n\"Moan louder, enjoy it more!\" William looked at her with a wicked smile, his hand caressing her breasts.\nVictoria bit her lip, shaking her head desperately, her vision blurred by tears.\n\"The more pitiful you look, the more I want to ravage you!\" William said with a cold laugh.\nBefore he finished speaking, he suddenly pulled out and flipped Victoria over, making her lie on the coffee table. Victoria's body went rigid, tears flowing, trembling uncontrollably.\nWilliam looked at her trembling back with intense pleasure. Victoria's body was too beautiful, making him unable to stop. The curve of her back was particularly enticing. He bent down, kissing her buttocks, leaving red marks.\nVictoria shamefully wiggled her hips, trying to escape. But William wouldn't let her, pressing her waist down with his hand, forcing her to raise her hips. With a forceful thrust, he entered her completely.\nVictoria let out a broken sound, her brows furrowing in pain, her hands gripping the tablecloth, her body convulsing.\nSeeing this, William thrust even harder. Victoria's head spun and her body went limp, as if she had lost consciousness, leaving only the rising pleasure and tingling sensation deep within her.\nAfter an unknown amount of time, William finally released. He didn't pull out immediately but lay on top of Victoria, panting, his sweat-drenched hair sticking to his forehead and nose.\nBy this time, Victoria had fallen into a deep sleep. Her delicate features were pale from exhaustion, her brow furrowed, and her expression filled with pain.\nWilliam gazed at her for a while, then picked up a towel to clean her body and helped her change into loose, comfortable loungewear. After doing all this, he didn't leave immediately but sat by the bed, watching the sleeping Victoria.\nHer tear-streaked face highlighted her smooth, delicate skin, and her slightly curled eyelashes trembled like butterfly wings. Even in sleep, she frowned, clearly not at peace. As William gazed at her sleeping face, a complicated expression flashed in his eyes.\nHe stood up, walked to the balcony, and lit a cigarette, the smoke curling around and blurring his handsome face. As his phone buzzed in his pocket, he took it out and answered.\n\"Mr. Scott, I've sent the information about the new secretaries to your email. Please check it,\" the HR manager said respectfully.\n\"Okay,\" William responded and hung up. He opened his inbox and saw the new emails with photos and resumes attached.\nWilliam skimmed through them. They were all graduates from top universities, young, beautiful, and capable.\nBut he thought to himself, 'Their eyes are too big and lifeless. This one's too short; I'd have to look down to speak. That one's been abroad too long and doesn't understand the domestic situation.'\nOut of a dozen candidates, none satisfied him, so William stubbed out his cigarette in frustration. He called the HR manager back and said in a low voice, \"What kind of people did you choose? Re-select!\"\n\"But Mr. Scott, we've already recommended dozens of secretaries to you recently,\" the HR manager said, sounding aggrieved. \"It's really hard to find anyone with better resumes than them!\"\n\"Do I pay you tens of thousands of dollars a month to hear this nonsense?\" William suppressed his anger and said in a deep voice, \"Find better ones immediately! Otherwise, don't blame me for firing you!\"\n\"Got it!\" the HR manager replied meekly, swallowing the words he wanted to say, \"Should I bring Ms. Carter back?\"\nBut he ultimately didn't dare and could only sigh, continuing to sift through the endless resumes.\nAfter hanging up, William rubbed his temples. How did he end up with such a bunch of idiots? Thinking about the chaotic work state these days, William lit another cigarette.\nAfter Victoria left, the HR department immediately assigned him a new secretary, but unlike Victoria, she couldn't even make coffee, organize documents properly, or understand the preferences of negotiation partners.\nThinking of Victoria, William felt even more irritated. He looked around Victoria's shabby rental apartment, which had only a small one-bedroom, no TV.\nHis gaze was drawn to the stack of paintings in the corner. Despite the small space, Victoria had meticulously arranged dozens of completed works neatly together.\nThere was also an unfinished painting-a dark background like an endless abyss, with a lonely figure curled up in the corner, surrounded by vague shadows. The lines of the figure were twisted, seemingly enduring immense pain. But in the figure's hand was a tightly held paintbrush, its tip glowing faintly, like a light of hope struggling to survive in the darkness.\nThe use of color was also extremely oppressive, with deep tones conveying an indescribable despair. However, within this despair, there was a hint of stubbornness and resilience.\nWilliam's gaze was fixed on the painting, a deep surprise in his eyes. Having received an elite education since childhood, he had a keen appreciation for art and could naturally discern the level of skill in a painting.\nVictoria's work, while still immature in technique, conveyed emotions that surged like an undercurrent, deeply affecting his heart.",

        "content": "William stared at the painting for what felt like forever. He finally tore his eyes away and glanced at the small bookshelf crammed with books, mostly about painting and art sales.\nHe picked one up and noticed that every book was filled with Victoria's notes, her handwriting neat and elegant, each page brimming with insights and reflections.\nShe must really love painting and her job at Starry Studio Gallery. Thinking this, William felt a weird sensation in his chest, making him second-guess what he was about to do.\nBut that doubt vanished the moment he saw the photos, most of which were of Victoria and Alvin, with Victoria smiling shyly and Alvin looking all gentle.\nA few were of her with Nora and Bobby, with Nora and Bobby holding hands intimately, while Victoria stood off to the side like she didn't belong.\nBut she had these photos in a prominent spot and kept them clean, clearly cherishing them.\nWhen William saw Alvin, a wave of hatred and disgust washed over him, and his eyes turned icy.\nAs his gaze shifted to the wall, he saw it was covered with notes and schedules from when Victoria was his secretary. It was packed with meticulous records of his schedule and preferences, showing she hadn't had time to clear them out. Among these busy records was a drawing of him with a pig's head-not a cute pink pig, but a fierce wild boar with tusks!\nWilliam sneered, wanting to tear the drawing to shreds and toss it in the trash, but for some reason, he lowered his hand. He thought, 'Forget it. The drawing is actually pretty good; it'd be a shame to ruin it.'\nAfter their encounter, he felt a bit hungry and turned to the fridge to find something to eat. But the fridge was almost empty, just canned food and instant noodles, no other ingredients.\nThere wasn't a single bag of chips, chocolate, or any snacks that young girls usually liked. No fresh fruit or milk either. Hard to believe this was the home of a girl who had just turned 20. No wonder Victoria always looked so thin.\nThinking of this, William was overwhelmed by a strange mix of emotions, which robbed him of his appetite. He tossed the cigarette he was holding aside, walked to the bedroom door, opened it a crack, and stared at Victoria on the bed.\nHer body was curled up, her legs tightly clamped together in a posture that exuded both fear and vulnerability. Tears streaked her delicate face, making her appear heartbreakingly pitiful.\nWilliam felt a pang in his heart, and his throat tightened. He admitted that although he loathed her, he liked her body. Even after just finishing, he could feel his desire stirring again. But seeing her like this now, he thought, 'It's better to just forget about it.'\nWilliam walked into the room, closed the door, took off his clothes, and got into bed. Victoria, half-asleep, vaguely felt something warm next to her. Feeling cold and tired, she instinctively moved closer to the warmth.\nWilliam's body tensed, but he didn't pull away.\nVictoria murmured in her sleep, \"So warm.\"\nWilliam looked down at her peaceful face and felt a tenderness he hadn't expected. He pulled Victoria into his arms, lowering his head to press his lips gently against her soft hair. Closing his eyes, he inhaled the faint, sweet scent of her hair, feeling himself getting lost in it.\nThe next morning, Victoria opened her eyes to see a handsome face.\nWilliam's eyes were closed, his long eyelashes casting shadows on his eye sockets. His chiseled features, with a straight and well-defined nose, were like a sculpture. However, this charming appearance filled Victoria with terror.\n\"Why are you still here!\" Victoria screamed, breaking free from his embrace, and jumped out of bed, throwing a pillow at him.\nWilliam was awakened and opened his sleepy eyes impatiently. \"Are you crazy?\" William shouted.\n\"Get out of my bedroom! I hate you!\" Victoria shouted, her eyes red.\nWilliam narrowed his gem-like eyes, staring at her dangerously, and sternly snapped, \"Say that to me one more time!\"\nVictoria gritted her teeth and said, \"This is my home! I don't want to see you here! Please leave!\"\nWilliam's face suddenly darkened. Victoria was only obedient when she was asleep! He suddenly grabbed Victoria's slender shoulders, pinning her against the wall, and warned her word by word, \"Victoria, do you know who you're talking to? You're just my sugar baby, what right do you have to order me around?\"\n\"We've already done!\" Victoria glared at him angrily and said, \"William, I'm not your property, I'm a person!\"\nWilliam sneered, \"Aren't you someone who can be paid to have sex? Why are you pretending to be chaste now? When I fucked you in the bathroom, didn't you moan with pleasure?\"\nHis tone was mocking and disdainful, as if Victoria was just a cheap prostitute in front of him. Trembling with anger and almost consumed by rage, Victoria couldn't take it anymore and slapped him hard. The crisp sound of the slap echoed in the room, and both of them were stunned.\nWilliam touched his right cheek, his deep eyes filled with intense fury, and coldly said, \"You're asking for it!\"\nVictoria realized she had made a big mistake in her impulsiveness. She closed her eyes, trembling, bracing herself for the storm of blows.\nBut the expected pain never came. She slowly opened one eye and saw William's fist suspended in mid-air, not coming down. His face was livid, his eyes cold, and veins bulging on his forehead.\nVictoria was terrified, trembling.\nWilliam glared at her fiercely before turning and slamming the door as he left. The loud bang made the entire door shake, causing Victoria to tremble all over.\nVictoria let out a sigh of relief and collapsed on the bed.\nWilliam stormed downstairs, where Harry was already waiting with the car at the door. His face was dark, and he said nothing as he opened the back door and got in.\nSeeing William's grim expression, Harry quickly asked, \"Mr. Scott, what happened?\"\nWilliam said, \"Get in touch with Mr. Simpson and tell him I accept his offer.\"\nHarry frowned and said, \"That amount is enough to buy out an entire top-tier gallery, yet he's only offering half the shares...\"\n\"Enough,\" William snapped, his face growing darker. \"Get it done.\"\n\"Got it,\" Harry replied, not daring to question further, and sped off.",

It felt pretty good, like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders, making her feel a lot more relaxed.\nShe glanced at the clock and realized she was almost late for work. She quickly washed up, changed clothes, and headed to Starry Studio Gallery.\nThe interns' training had one more week to go. At the end of the week, there'd be an exam, and combined with their usual performance scores, the five lowest-scoring interns would be cut.\nThe training schedule was jam-packed, with everything from deep dives into art history to intense client communication training and hands-on art appreciation exercises. Every bit of it was important.\nUnlike the other interns, Victoria wasn't feeling too confident. She was on edge and threw herself into studying like her life depended on it. She took detailed notes, used every spare moment to memorize, and even reviewed her notes while eating, which got her some teasing from the other interns.\n\"Victoria, you're working so hard. Do you really think a top gallery like Starry Studio Gallery would keep a high school grad like you?\"\n\"Yeah, you're probably wasting your time!\"\n\"We learned all this stuff in college. Don't you think it's a bit late to start cramming now?\"\nBut Victoria ignored them and kept her head down, writing.\nWendy, who admired Victoria's determination, couldn't stand it anymore and spoke up. \"Don't underestimate people. Where there's a will, there's a way. I believe Victoria can do it.\"\nWendy came from a well-off background, so people like Lyra Cole, who mocked Victoria, didn't dare argue with her.\nVictoria heard Wendy defending her and looked up, giving her a grateful smile. Wendy responded with a thumbs-up, showing her support.\nDuring the practical training in client communication skills, a high-profile client showed up. He was dressed to the nines, wore gold-rimmed glasses, and had his hair perfectly styled. He looked like someone who could drop serious cash on art.\nLyra, brimming with confidence, was the first to greet him.\nShe warmly welcomed him, \"Hello, welcome to our gallery.\"\nBut the client just glanced at her and said, \"Why do all these paintings look so mediocre?\"\nLyra quickly pointed to a brightly colored oil painting, \"This piece is by one of our gallery's popular artists. The brushwork is delicate, and the colors are harmonious. Look how vivid the scene is.\"\nThe client frowned and said, \"Too flashy, tacky!\"\nLyra then suggested a simple sketch, but the client dismissed it as \"Too plain!\"\nShe tried everything to please the client, but he wasn't having it. In the end, she had to give up, frustrated. Other interns stepped up to try, including the highly regarded Wendy and Irvin.\nBut whether they talked about art history or the works' collection value, they couldn't impress the picky client. Everyone looked dejected and confused.\nJust when everyone was at a loss, Victoria took a deep breath and gathered the courage to approach the client. She smiled and said, \"Hey there, looks like you have pretty high standards for art.\"\nThe client glanced at her but didn't say anything.\nVictoria didn't back down. \"Art is super subjective. Everyone sees beauty differently. When do you plan to enjoy the painting?\"\nThe client seemed a bit surprised by her question. After a moment, he said, \"I want something I can enjoy in my downtime.\"\nVictoria immediately thought of a landscape painting tucked away in the corner of the gallery. She led him over and softly introduced it, \"Check this out. The artist uses delicate brushstrokes and a unique composition to create these serene, beautiful landscapes. The subtle tones give off a sense of tranquility and depth. I think this might be what you're looking for.\"\nThe client examined the painting closely, showing a hint of interest. But he didn't decide right away. Instead, he asked, \"Who's the artist? What are his works like? Is the price reasonable?\"\nVictoria patiently answered all his questions. She talked about the artist's background and style and explained how the price was determined. Her answers were professional and sincere, without any fluff, making them easy to listen to.\nAfter hearing her out, the client finally nodded and said, \"Alright, I'll take it.\"\n\"Thank you so much!\" Victoria was thrilled and quickly took the painting down to pack it carefully.\nThe painting was priced at over thirty thousand dollars, but the client paid without hesitation and even mentioned he'd be back if he needed more art.\nVictoria thanked him sincerely. The other interns were green with envy and secretly cursed her luck. Only Wendy was genuinely happy for her.\nDiana and Frank had been watching everything.\nFinally, Friday rolled around, and it was time for the final assessment.\nThe test covered a bunch of topics, including art history, gallery management, and customer service. Victoria had reviewed everything meticulously and was extra careful while answering.\nAfter the assessment, all the interns anxiously waited for the results, nervously seated in the packed gallery conference room.\nFrank and Diana stood at the front, ready to announce the scores.\nWhen Frank read out each person's score, the room was filled with anticipation and anxiety. As the scores were announced, some were happy, and some were disappointed. Those with higher scores smiled with relief, while those with lower scores looked dejected.\n\"Victoria, fifth place,\" Frank announced clearly. When her score was announced, there was a small commotion in the room.\nVictoria was overjoyed to have secured her place with a fifth-place finish. But then, Irvin stood up. As a top graduate from the University of Aesthetics Shine, he was filled with resentment and anger after being eliminated in the first round.\n\"I question the fairness of this assessment! How can a high school graduate like Victoria score higher than me? There must be a mistake,\" he exclaimed, glaring at Victoria with a fierce look and gritted teeth.",

        "content": "Victoria's body went rigid, and she stood there, stunned. Irvin's questioning was like a bomb dropped in a quiet room, instantly causing a stir. His face turned red with anger, frustration burning in his eyes.\n\"I can't believe a high school grad with no professional background could beat me so quickly. She must've gotten this internship through some shady connections. Who's to say she didn't get fifth place the same way?\" His voice echoed through the conference room, making the tense atmosphere even worse.\nVictoria's eyes welled up with tears as she felt both wronged and helpless.\nShe bit her lower lip, took a deep breath, and forced herself to calm down before speaking. \"Irvin, yes, I was recommended for the internship, but I swear no one said a word for me during the assessment.\"\nWendy frowned, clearly annoyed with Irvin's behavior. She said, \"Irvin, you can't just accuse others because you're upset. We've all seen how hard Victoria worked during her internship; she earned this.\"\nThe other interns started whispering among themselves. Some got where Irvin was coming from, given he was a top grad from the University of Aesthetics Shine and still got eliminated. Others thought he couldn't accept defeat gracefully. Questioning the fairness of the evaluation without any concrete evidence was really beneath him.\nFrank looked at the chaotic scene, cleared his throat, and said firmly, \"Everyone, quiet down. I want to stress again that this assessment was completely fair and just. We have strict standards and procedures, and every step was carefully evaluated. Victoria's results are because of her own efforts, and we don't play favorites.\"\n\"I don't buy it!\" Irvin said, his voice trembling with emotion. \"I've studied at a professional academy for years and worked my butt off; how could I be outdone by a college dropout?\"\nDiana shook her head and said, \"Irvin, you need to face the facts. We all see how hard you work, but in art, a degree and experience aren't everything. If you keep making a scene, you'll just embarrass yourself even more.\"\nIrvin's expression darkened even more, and he spat out angrily, \"I'm not making a scene. I'm seeking justice!\"\nDiana frowned slightly, a hint of annoyance in her eyes. \"Do you want me to be blunt? Your talent in art isn't as good as hers, got it?\" she said.\nIrvin was left speechless. As a student of the University of Aesthetics Shine, he knew that talent was everything in art. No matter how diligent and hardworking you were, you could never surpass a genius.\nDiana's words felt like a slap in the face, making him feel ashamed and desperate to leave the awkward situation. He took a long look at Victoria, then turned and left the gallery.\nSeeing this, Victoria breathed a sigh of relief, glad she managed to stay. Wendy stayed too, and the two, eager to celebrate their first victory in the internship competition, found a restaurant and excitedly talked about their upcoming plans.\nWendy was the first friend Victoria made after her family incident. Her old classmates and friends started avoiding her once they found out Alvin was behind the gym and bridge collapse.\nWhen Victoria nervously told Wendy that Alvin was her dad, Wendy's reaction totally caught her off guard. Her eyes widened in surprise, then she sighed softly and patted Victoria's shoulder. \"This is about your dad, but he's already been punished. You don't need to carry that burden.\"\nWendy's kind words made Victoria's eyes well up. She sniffled and nodded, her voice choked with emotion. \"Thanks, Wendy.\"\nWendy shook her head with a smile and playfully pinched Victoria's cheek. \"Come on, why the tears? After dinner, let's go shopping. We need a break.\"\nVictoria didn't really want to buy anything, but she was happy to tag along with Wendy. Just as she was about to agree, her phone rang. It was Nora.\nVictoria hesitated for a moment, then apologized to Wendy and stepped aside to take the call.\nAs soon as she picked up, Nora's shrill, grating voice came through. \"Victoria, where the hell have you been? Have you forgotten I'm still in the hospital?\"\nVictoria hadn't forgotten, but she really didn't want to deal with Nora, who only seemed to see her as a cash machine.\nShe lowered her voice. \"Mom, I've been busy with my new job. Besides, I've already paid this month's medical bills. Just focus on getting better.\"\nNora immediately snapped, \"New job? Why did you change jobs? The Scott Group paid well. Does your new job pay as much?\"\nVictoria patiently replied, \"It doesn't pay as much, but this job lets me learn more, and I really like it.\"\nNora was livid. \"You only care about your own happiness? What about Bobby's tuition and my medical bills? Do you have any conscience?\"\nVictoria kept her voice calm. \"Mom, please respect my choice. I have my own plans. I've already paid a month's medical bills. The doctor said you could've been discharged long ago, but you insisted on staying in the hospital because you think the care is better.\"\nNora retorted, \"I have kidney failure, and you want me to recover at home? In your shabby rental? Do you want me to die there?\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together, silent for a moment, then softly said, \"Mom, as long as you follow the doctor's advice and go to the hospital regularly for dialysis, you can live independently...\"\nBefore Victoria could finish, Nora rudely interrupted, \"Shut up! You just want me to die quickly so you can be free. I'm telling you, that's not going to happen!\"\nVictoria felt like her throat was filled with cotton, making it hard to breathe. She held back her emotions, trying to keep her voice steady. \"Mom, I don't mean that. I just hope you can understand my difficulties. Staying in the hospital is too expensive, and the dialysis costs are increasing.\"\nVictoria's tone was filled with obvious pleading and helplessness, which only made Nora more furious. Her voice shook through the phone. \"Why didn't you sign the settlement agreement with Ella? She gave us a $200,000 deposit, and as soon as you sign the contract, the remaining $800,000 will be ours. I'm telling you, I'm not returning the money. Do you want me to go to jail like Alvin before you're satisfied?\"",

        "content": "Nora's words hit Victoria like a ton of bricks, and the tears she'd been holding back finally spilled over.\n\"Mom, how can you do this to me? You never care about the pain I've been through; all you care about is the money I bring home. Do whatever you want, but I'd rather die than make up with Ella. Figure it out yourself!\" She slammed the phone down.\nJust then, Wendy walked over, handed Victoria some tissues, and asked, \"Victoria, what's wrong?\"\nVictoria wiped her tears and forced a smile. \"Oh, it's nothing, just a little fight with my mom. I must look so silly.\"\nWendy put a comforting hand on her shoulder and said softly, \"I don't think that at all. My family...\"\nHer voice trailed off, and she struggled to continue. \"Just know I'm here for you. If you ever need anything, just ask.\"\nVictoria was touched and said, \"Thanks, Wendy.\"\nNeither of them felt like shopping anymore, so after finishing their meal, they went their separate ways.\nWhen Victoria got home, she found a letter at her door. It was a pass to the University of Aesthetics Shine sent by Samuel. Victoria was thrilled, and her earlier gloom lifted a bit.\nJust then, Samuel texted her, saying there was a public lecture at the University of Aesthetics Shine the next morning and asked if she wanted to go. Of course, Victoria agreed right away.\nThe next morning, she got up early, got ready, and hurried to the University of Aesthetics Shine.\nAs she stepped onto the campus, it reminded her of the day she went to Imagination Realm University abroad last year, though she felt completely different now.\nImagination Realm University, renowned for its rich history and innovative teaching methods, had been a transformative experience for Victoria, even though she was there for less than half a year. The teachers encouraged students to experiment with various artistic styles and techniques.\nWhen she had to leave because of family issues, the teachers and students didn't want her to go and even offered her a scholarship to stay. Despite her reluctance, Victoria couldn't ignore her family's needs, so she dropped out and went back home.\nThe University of Aesthetics Shine combined the elegance of traditional architecture with modern design. Its teaching philosophy emphasized preserving and innovating traditional culture while incorporating advanced international artistic ideas. It was on par with top schools abroad.\nVictoria found a seat in a corner and overheard the girls in front of her chatting excitedly.\n\"Today is Professor Brown's public lecture. I've been looking forward to this for so long!\" said a girl with glasses, her face lit up with excitement.\n\"Yeah, Professor Brown is the youngest professor here. I heard he comes from an artistic family, with both parents being famous artists. No wonder he's so talented,\" another short-haired girl chimed in.\n\"His works have won many awards both here and abroad. It's really impressive,\" a tall boy nodded in agreement.\n\"And he's super handsome! Every time he gives a lecture, the room is packed. Lots of girls come just to see him,\" the girl with glasses teased with a grin.\n\"Do you think the emerging artist Joshua could be Professor Brown? I heard one of his paintings can sell for tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars,\" the short-haired girl exclaimed, then shook her head. \"No way. If Professor Brown were Joshua, why would he hide his identity? He could just sell his paintings under his own name. There's no need to be so secretive.\"\n\"Right!\" The girl with glasses seemed to have an epiphany.\nJust then, there was a sudden commotion on the stage.\n\"Professor Brown is here.\" The short-haired girl pointed excitedly at the steps, her eyes sparkling.\nVictoria looked towards the steps and saw Samuel walking in casually.\nToday, he was wearing a light gray shirt with black trousers and white casual shoes, looking both gentle and elegant, refined and dashing. His posture was upright, his features clear, and his every move exuded the elegance and composure of an artist.\nHe stood at the podium, his expression calm as he glanced around, a slight smile playing on his lips.\n\"Hello, everyone. I'm Samuel. Today, I'll be giving a brief talk on the expressiveness of painting.\" Samuel's steady and magnetic voice echoed in the classroom, making everyone quiet down.\nHe continued, \"The expressiveness of painting refers to the artist's ability to convey their inner emotions, thoughts, and creativity to the audience through various painting elements and techniques. Can anyone give an example of how you can feel the expressiveness of a painting?\"\nA student raised their hand and answered, \"I think color can do that. For example, a painting with bright colors might give a strong emotional impact.\"\nSamuel smiled and nodded. \"Very good. Does anyone else have a different perspective?\"\nAnother student stood up and said, \"I think the use of lines is also important. Different lines can convey different emotions. For instance, straight lines might give a sense of stability, while curves are softer and more dynamic.\"\nSamuel looked at the students appreciatively and said, \"You all have very good points. Now, let's think deeper about what other factors can enhance the expressiveness of a painting.\"\nAt this moment, Samuel's gaze swept toward the corner of the classroom and landed on Victoria. He said, \"The girl in the corner, could you answer?\"\nVictoria had thought Samuel hadn't seen her, but now he was looking directly at her, waiting for her answer.\nShe quickly stood up, feeling a bit nervous yet excited, and answered, \"I believe composition also greatly affects the expressiveness of a painting. A well-thought-out composition can guide the viewer's eye, highlight the focal points, and enhance the rhythm and harmony of the piece. The artist's brushwork can also convey different emotions and atmospheres.\"\nAfter answering, Victoria nervously awaited Samuel's evaluation.\nSamuel's smile widened slightly. \"Excellent. Your answer is comprehensive and insightful.\" With that, he led the class in an enthusiastic round of applause for Victoria.\nVictoria's face flushed, and she felt a sense of joy and pride she hadn't experienced in a long time.\nFor the rest of the lecture, Samuel explained in detail how to better use various techniques to express emotions.\nVictoria listened intently, taking notes and occasionally asking questions. After the class ended, Victoria packed her things and was about to leave with the other students when Samuel called out to her, \"Victoria, could you stay for a moment?\"",

        "content": "Feeling all kinds of awkward under her classmates' curious stares, Victoria shuffled over to Samuel and asked, \"Professor Brown, did you need something from me?\"\nSamuel gave her a warm smile and asked, \"So, how'd you feel about today's class?\"\nVictoria bit her lip, trying to steady her nerves. She looked up at Samuel and said earnestly, \"I thought today's class was super helpful. I really got a better grasp on expressiveness and picked up a lot of practical skills.\"\n\"That's great,\" Samuel nodded, clearly pleased. \"I've got another class at the same time next Sunday morning. Will you be there?\"\nVictoria's face lit up. \"Yes, absolutely, I'll be there.\"\nSamuel smiled back. \"Alright then. See you next week.\"\n\"Thank you, Professor Brown,\" Victoria said gratefully before turning to leave.\nAs Samuel watched her go, a faint smile played on his lips, and there was a glint of amusement in his eyes.\nMeanwhile, over at the swanky Garcia Villa, things were looking pretty grim.\nZachary Garcia, the head honcho of the Garcia family, was in his study dealing with business when his phone rang urgently. He frowned and answered the call. By the time it ended, his face was ashen.\nHe slammed the phone down on his desk, cursing, \"Idiot!\"\nHe got up and started pacing, his anger bubbling up. He couldn't believe Ella had done something so dumb. Sure, he knew she wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but this was a new low.\nTrying to keep his cool, Zachary called for the butler to bring Ella to the study.\nElla walked in, not even having a chance to ask what was up before Zachary slapped her hard, yelling, \"You foolish girl!\"\nElla's cheek burned, and blood trickled from the corner of her mouth. She clutched her stinging cheek, tears streaming down her face. \"Dad, why did you hit me?\" she asked.\nZachary roared, \"How dare you question me? You useless waste! Do you have any idea how much trouble you've caused?\"\n\"What did I do wrong?\" Ella shot back, wiping her tears and glaring at Zachary.\nZachary snapped, \"Playing dumb? The four guys you sent to mess with William's secretary got caught by the cops! They've already spilled the beans, and you still deny it?\"\n\"That bitch actually called the cops?\" Ella was stunned for a second, then scoffed, \"So what if they got caught? William won't back her up. With the Garcia family's power, what do we have to fear from her?\"\nZachary was livid. \"The secretary isn't the issue. The female cop on her case, Luna, is from the Bailey family! The Baileys are a military family, and no matter how rich we are, we can't go up against them! She's not letting this go, and you're going to end up in jail!\"\nHearing this, Ella shuddered. She suddenly realized how serious things were and ran to Zachary, crying and pleading, \"Dad, I don't want to go to jail! Please help me!\"\nAt that moment, Ella's mom, Willow Reed, rushed in, trying to calm Zachary down. \"Zachary, Ella's young and didn't fully understand what she was doing. Please don't be too hard on her. We need to find a way to fix this!\"\nSeeing Willow plead for Ella only made Zachary angrier. \"How dare you plead for her! If you hadn't spoiled her rotten, we wouldn't be in this mess! I should've let my mother raise her. Look at Alice, she is so sensible and accomplished from a young age. If it weren't for...\"\nHe trailed off, remembering something, and after a sigh, continued, \"If it weren't for that incident, how could I have let you replace Alice to marry William? You're the rightful future Mrs. Scott of the Scott family. Why even bother competing with a secretary? You've done it now, and you've been caught. That was incredibly foolish!\"\nHearing Zachary mention Alice and constantly compare her, Ella felt deeply wronged and cried out, \"Alice, it's always Alice. You've always thought I'm not as good as her. No matter what I do, you're never satisfied. She deserved...\"\nBefore she could finish, Zachary raised his hand to strike her again.\nWillow quickly stepped in to stop him. \"Zachary, Ella is still young. Don't blame her. Let's talk this through calmly!\"\nZachary, veins bulging on his forehead in anger, pointed at Ella and Willow with a trembling hand, shouting in disappointment, \"How could I have such a foolish daughter! You two figure it out yourselves. If you can't get Victoria to settle, then get out of the Garcia family. I don't have a daughter like you!\"\nWith that, he shook off Willow's grip and stormed out, leaving Ella trembling with anger.\nElla glared at his departing figure, seething with hatred.\nWillow hurriedly checked Ella's face, tenderly applying medicine to her injury while scolding, \"He hit you too hard. Look, your face is swollen.\"\nElla pouted and cried in Willow's arms. \"He only favors Alice. He doesn't care about me at all. In his eyes, I'm just dirt under Alice's feet, not worth anything. When I get into trouble, he only blames me for disgracing the Garcia family and doesn't care whether I live or die!\"\nHearing this, Willow patted Ella's shoulder, comforting her. \"Don't worry. I won't let anything happen to you. As for Victoria, she's just a powerless woman who got ahead by selling herself. I'll make her pay for it.\"\nElla's eyes lit up at Willow's words, and she smiled through her tears. \"Mom, what should we do?\" she asked.\nWillow smirked coldly and replied, \"Get her to meet us. I'll make sure she signs the settlement agreement and teach her a lesson.\"\nElla was initially delighted but then shook her head. \"That bitch is very cunning. She won't come out easily.\"\nWillow smiled slyly and said, \"Didn't you give her mom two hundred thousand dollars? Have her mom trick her into coming out.\"\nHearing Willow's idea, Ella clapped her hands in approval.",

She tried to ignore it and kept writing, but Nora was persistent.\nWith a sigh, Victoria finally picked up. \"Mom, what now?\" she asked, not hiding her annoyance.\nNora's voice was shaky and urgent. \"Victoria, you have to help Bobby! He got into a fight and hurt someone badly. They want five grand, or they'll call the cops. I don't know what else to do. Please, go check on him.\"\nVictoria rolled her eyes. \"Mom, didn't I give you all my money? Why don't you use that?\"\nNora hesitated, then said, \"I'm on dialysis and can't go. I'll transfer the money to you, and you can handle it, okay?\"\nDespite her frustration, Victoria couldn't ignore her mom's plea. \"Fine, I'll go,\" she said.\nAfter hanging up, she changed clothes and headed to the address Nora gave her. When she got there, it was an old, run-down factory with peeling paint and weeds everywhere.\nVictoria paused at the entrance, unsure if she should go in. She tried calling Bobby, but his line was busy. Feeling uneasy, she was about to leave when the door swung open. A group of bodyguards surrounded her. One of them said, \"Come with us.\"\nVictoria's heart sank, and she felt a wave of panic. She couldn't believe Nora would put her in danger like this for money! Taking a deep breath, Victoria looked around, hoping for an escape route. But the bodyguards blocked every exit. She had no choice but to follow them inside.\nInside, Ella and Willow stood out in their fancy suits against the shabby backdrop. Ella's smile was twisted with malice as she saw Victoria being pushed in.\n\"You must be Victoria,\" Willow said, looking her up and down. \"No wonder you managed to get William with that face.\"\nVictoria ignored her, focusing on Ella, who was lounging in a chair. \"Did you go through all this just to humiliate me?\" she asked.\nElla smirked. \"Who's humiliating you? My mom's just telling it like it is. Don't think you can climb up by clinging to William. Have you seen yourself? Just sign the settlement, or I'll make sure you regret it.\"\nVictoria, fed up with Ella's attitude, shot back, \"I don't care if William likes me or not. I won't settle even if you kill me. Do you think Luna won't find out?\"\nElla's face twisted with rage. \"Shut up, you bitch!\" she screamed.\nVictoria smirked, taunting, \"The fearless Ms. Garcia, scared of something?\"\n\"Stop trying to scare me!\" Ella snapped, trying to sound tough, but her voice wavered.\nSensing Ella be at a disadvantage, Willow stepped up and slapped Victoria hard. \"You're really pushing it now! You're just a whore who'd sell anything for money. How much do you want to settle? A million? Three million?\"\nHeld back by the bodyguards, Victoria couldn't retaliate. She sneered, \"Sure, I'll settle. Give me three hundred million dollars, and I might consider it.\"\nWillow's face flushed with anger, and she slapped Victoria again. \"Three hundred million? You're out of your mind!\"\nWiping the blood from her mouth, Victoria said calmly, \"Then there's nothing more to discuss.\"\n\"Bitch!\" Willow's face turned red with rage. She wanted to strangle Victoria but feared Luna's retaliation. She had to hold back her anger and play her trump card.\nShe pulled some photos from her bag and shoved them at Victoria. \"Let's see if you can still act tough after seeing these.\"\nVictoria took the photos, her face gradually turning pale, her pupils dilating, and her fingers trembling.\nSeeing Victoria's reaction, Ella was delighted. \"Get a good look? Want me to have a few more taken for you?\"\nVictoria gripped the photos tightly, her knuckles turning white, unaware of her nails digging into her flesh. The photos showed Alvin, beaten and bruised in prison, his face swollen and body covered in injuries. Seeing this, Victoria felt suffocated, her eyes red and tears welling up.\nNora had always favored Bobby, but despite his busy work schedule, Alvin had always been kind and loving to Victoria. And now, because of Victoria, Alvin was suffering!\nVictoria suddenly looked up, her eyes bloodshot, and screamed, \"Ella! Do you have any humanity left?\"\n\"Humanity? In this world of the strong devouring the weak, only the strong have the right to talk about humanity!\" Ella laughed maniacally and continued, \"He deserves it! If he wants to blame someone, blame him for his bad luck, having a daughter like you!\"\nWillow chimed in, \"Victoria, if you remain stubborn, I'll have to let people take care of him more!\"\nVictoria's breath hitched, her legs gave way, and she collapsed to the ground, sobbing uncontrollably, her tears soaking her cheeks.\nSeeing her like this, Ella felt a surge of satisfaction and said arrogantly, \"Victoria, I'll give you one last chance. Agree to settle and never bother William again, or else...\"\nVictoria looked up at Ella, hatred in her eyes, \"Bring the settlement agreement, I'll sign it. But if you harm my dad again, I'll fight you to the end! My life may be cheap, but I'll drag you down with me!\"\n\"You!\" Ella raised her hand to slap her again but was stopped by Willow. She said, \"Ella, let her sign the agreement first.\"\nVictoria took the settlement agreement from Ella and signed it forcefully, pressing her fingerprint beside her signature.\nSeeing this, Ella nodded in satisfaction and ordered the bodyguards, \"Take her phone and lock her in the basement for five days. Give her just enough water to keep her alive.\"",

Ella shot Victoria a smug look and sneered, \"Let's see how you continue to be arrogant now, bitch!\"\nVictoria knew fighting back would only make things worse, so she let them take her bag and phone. They shoved her into the basement of an old, abandoned factory, tossed a bottle of water at her, and locked the door behind them.\nThe basement was damp and dark, with walls covered in mold and a sickening smell of decay. A faint light trickled in from a high-up ventilation window.\nIn the eerie silence, the occasional rustling sounds around made even someone as tough as Victoria feel a chill down her spine.\nShe slowly slid down the wall, hugging her knees, trying to calm herself and figure out a way to escape. Then, a weird-looking bug, about the size of half her palm and glowing a strange green, crawled toward her. Her eyes widened in horror, and she let out a scream.\nThe natural fear of bugs made her scoot back into a corner until she had nowhere else to go.\nAs the bug got closer, Victoria summoned her courage and stomped on it hard. It squished instantly, splattering a foul-smelling, sticky goo.\nVictoria looked at the disgusting mess on her shoe, and her stomach churned. She dry-heaved a few times, almost throwing up.\nFinally, the tears she had been holding back spilled over, streaming down her face. She cried and cried, then suddenly laughed. Wiping away her tears, she started to pull herself together and plan her escape.\nShe felt along the wall, hoping to find a crack or something to grip, but it was too smooth. She searched the ground, hoping to find something useful. Instead, she found a few sharp stones that cut her fingers, making them bleed and sting.\nShe quickly wrapped her hand with a piece of her clothing and kept looking for a way out. But even after the sun had set, she hadn't found a clue.\nComplete darkness swallowed the basement, like an endless black hole, terrifying and deep. Even though Victoria wasn't claustrophobic, she felt anxious and uneasy in that environment.\nShe stood still, trying to ignore the creepy sounds of insects and dripping water. She tried to control her trembling arms, then found a corner to sit down and hugged herself tightly.\n\"Will anyone come to save me?\" Victoria muttered with a bitter smile, clinging to a sliver of hope.\nWhat if Nora got the money and, out of guilt, called Victoria? If Nora couldn't reach her, would she worry and come looking for her? But deep down, Victoria knew it was just wishful thinking. Nora would never care about her life or death.\nNora was probably celebrating with Bobby, spending the money she got from betraying Victoria. Thinking of this, Victoria couldn't help but lower her eyes and smile bitterly.\nAlvin was right; she shouldn't have cared about them anymore. Her indecisiveness had led to this situation, and she deserved to be here, suffering.\nBut besides Nora, who else could possibly come to save her? As soon as this thought crossed her mind, William's image flashed before her eyes. What if he was willing to help her? But she quickly dismissed the thought.\nVictoria bit her lip, shaking her head, forcing herself not to fantasize about such a possibility. William despised her, so why would he help her?\nThinking of this, Victoria hugged herself even tighter, trying to sleep to conserve energy; otherwise, she wouldn't be able to think of a way out tomorrow.\nLate at night, William was still grinding away in his office. Harry knocked and stepped in to remind him about dinner. \"Mr. Scott, your dinner's ready.\"\nWilliam barely glanced up. \"You can have it.\"\nHarry hesitated, then asked, \"Are you working on the Starry Studio Gallery deal?\"\nOnly something big like that would keep William working this late. William's eyes locked onto Harry, sharp and intense. \"Got a lot of extra energy, do you? Since when is it your place to question my business?\"\nHarry gulped and quickly backed off. \"Sorry, Mr. Scott. I'll leave you to it.\"\nWilliam went back to the contract.\nHugo Simpson, that sly fox, knew William was desperate to get Starry Studio Gallery and jacked up the price, making him pay a premium for just 45% of the shares. But Hugo still held the management rights.\nNormally, William would never sign such a bad deal. But now, he didn't care. Did Victoria think she could get away from him? Not a chance. He had to keep her close and make her suffer. The thought made him sneer.\nThe next morning, Victoria woke up starving. She hadn't eaten since yesterday morning, and her stomach was growling.\nShe took a small sip of the mineral water, struggled to sit up from the cold floor, and staggered to the door, leaning against the wall. It was an iron gate, thick as a thumb, welded shut with heavy steel bars, solid and unmovable.\nVictoria tried pulling it a few times, but not only did it not budge, but her wrists ached from the effort.\nNot ready to give up, she turned to the ventilation window. If she could break it and climb up, she could escape. She picked up a small stone and threw it at the window with all her might.\nAfter several tries, she finally broke the glass. The shards fell, almost cutting her. Looking at them on the ground, she got an idea.\nShe tore a piece of cloth from her sleeve, wrapped it around the glass, and used it to dig into the wall, trying to make some holes to climb up to the window.\nIt was a clumsy method, but better than waiting to die in this awful place. Victoria kept at it, digging into the wall.\nEven with the cloth, her palm got cut by the glass shards, but she didn't give up. She tore more cloth to wrap around her hand and kept digging.\nVictoria, standing at 5'6\", could reach up to 6'5\" with her hands raised. From day to night, enduring hunger and exhaustion, she worked tirelessly until four or five in the morning, finally making a few holes. She collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath.\nNext, she needed to tear her coat into strips, tie them around a rock, and toss it onto the window to wedge it open. Then she could climb up and through the hole onto the windowsill.\nFeeling a surge of hope, Victoria got to work. She made a rope out of her clothes and, after much effort, secured the stone on the window frame.\nLuckily, she was slim; otherwise, the window frame would have broken immediately.\nVictoria tugged on the rope, finding it stable enough, and slowly climbed up using the holes. As she neared the window, joy filled her heart, and she climbed even harder.\nBut just as she was about to reach the window, the makeshift rope snapped, and she lost her balance and fell backward.\nWith a dull thud, she hit the ground hard. Her waist struck the floor, sending waves of intense pain through her body, and she blacked out instantly.",

        "content": "On Monday morning, Wendy brought some of her favorite breakfast goodies to share with Victoria.\nShe waited at the Starry Studio Gallery, but even after work hours had passed, there was still no sign of Victoria.\nWendy shot Victoria a message, but got no reply, and her calls went straight to voicemail. She started to get worried. Victoria was never late, let alone disappear without a trace.\nCould Victoria be sick?\nSince Victoria got her internship through some internal connections, Wendy figured Diana must know Victoria's friends. So she rushed to Diana's office and anxiously asked, \"Ms. Simpson, did Victoria take a leave of absence?\"\n\"She didn't come?\" Diana asked, her expression shifting slightly.\nVictoria hadn't asked for leave from Diana. She was always hardworking and would never skip work without a reason. Could something have happened to her?\nThinking of this, Diana told Wendy to go back to work and then called Elara to ask about the situation.\nElara also thought Victoria might be sick and quickly took out a spare key to check on her, only to find that she wasn't home. After making numerous unanswered calls, Elara quickly informed Diana that Victoria might be missing and asked Diana to think of a solution.\nDiana's face darkened as she thought of William, who had recently spent a lot of money to acquire their gallery. She had heard from Elara that Victoria used to work at the Scott Group.\nNow that Victoria was missing, even if it wasn't William's doing, he was definitely involved. Although Diana didn't know what kind of entanglement they had, Victoria was now part of Starry Studio Gallery, and Diana wouldn't allow anyone to harm her.\nSince William had spent a lot of money to acquire 45% of Starry Studio Gallery's shares, he shouldn't harm Victoria anymore.\nAfter some thought, Diana dialed William's number. When his phone rang, William saw it was an unfamiliar number. He frowned and answered, just about to ask who it was when Diana's slightly cold voice came through, \"Mr. Scott, hello, it's Diana Simpson.\"\nWilliam thought, 'Diana? Hugo's daughter, the general manager of Starry Studio Gallery. Why would Diana be calling me?'\n\"Ms. Simpson, what can I do for you?\" he asked indifferently.\nDiana asked, \"Mr. Scott, do you know Victoria? She used to work at your company.\"\nWhen William heard her words, his expression froze slightly. Diana was really smart, quickly guessing that he had acquired shares in Starry Studio Gallery because of Victoria. As expected of cunning Hugo's daughter from the Simpson family.\nThinking of this, William cleared his throat and replied indifferently, \"Yes, I know her.\"\n\"Since you know her, I'll get straight to the point. She's missing. It wasn't you, was it?\" Diana's voice sounded a bit agitated.\n\"She's missing?\" William's voice suddenly rose a few notches.\nDiana paused for a second, then recounted what had happened that morning, finally saying, \"If you could help me find her, I would be very grateful.\" Then she hung up the phone.\nWilliam stared at the darkened screen for a moment, then stood up and shouted, \"Harry, get in here!\"\nIn no time, Harry entered the room and respectfully said, \"Mr. Scott.\"\n\"Find out where Victoria is,\" William ordered with a stern face.\nHarry's heart skipped a beat when he heard this. Victoria was missing?\n\"Got it,\" he said and prepared to leave.\n\"Wait,\" William suddenly called out. \"Don't forget to check on Ella's whereabouts as well,\" he added.\n\"Okay,\" Harry said and immediately left.\nWilliam leaned back in his chair, his eyes deep. The only sign of his emotions was the tightly clenched pen in his hand. Soon, Harry discovered that Victoria's last call was from Nora. After that, Victoria's phone lost signal.\nA shadow crossed William's eyes, and he immediately headed to Nora's hospital room with his men.\nNora was happily talking to Bobby on the phone, smiling as she said, \"Ella kept her word. As soon as Victoria signed, the remaining $800,000 was transferred! Bobby, I'll send you the money right away and give you an extra $50,000 for spending money!\"\n\"Really? That's great! Now I can definitely get into the University of Aesthetics Shine!\" Bobby said excitedly.\nNora sighed and said, \"It's all Victoria's fault. If she had signed earlier, your matter wouldn't have been delayed for so long.\"\n\"Exactly, my classmates have already started training for a week. I have to go pay the fees now!\" Bobby said eagerly and hung up the phone.\nNora put away her phone, a satisfied expression on her face. Just as she was about to ask the caregiver for a glass of water, the door was kicked open.\nNora was startled and turned to see a group of men storming in. Just as she was about to question them, William stepped forward, his deep voice cutting through the silence. \"Victoria is missing. Does it have anything to do with you?\"\nNora's eyes widened in panic, and she exclaimed, \"Who are you? What right do you have to meddle in our family affairs?\"\nWilliam's gaze was as sharp as an ice blade as he looked at Nora. He said, \"You'd better tell me everything honestly, or don't blame me for being rude!\"\nHearing this, Nora couldn't help but shiver. She had never seen such a fierce look before; it was terrifying.\n\"I don't know. She's my daughter. Why would I harm her?\" she insisted through gritted teeth.\nWilliam sneered, his tone full of sarcasm. \"I only believe in evidence!\" With that, William turned to Harry and gave him a look. Harry understood and stepped forward, pinning Nora against the wall.\n\"What are you doing? Help! Murder!\" Nora screamed at the top of her lungs.\n\"Shut up! If you keep yelling, I'll cut out your tongue!\" Harry threatened viciously.\n\"You dare! Let me go! I warn you...\" Before Nora could finish, a slap landed on Nora's cheek, leaving a bright red handprint. Her smooth skin immediately swelled with the imprint of the palm, looking quite shocking.\n\"I advise you not to shout. My patience is limited,\" William said expressionlessly.\nNora's body trembled, and she slowly stopped struggling, stammering. \"I don't know why she's missing. I just sent her to a place.\"\n\"Where?\" William pressed.\nNora then gave William the address of the abandoned factory, not forgetting to add, \"This has nothing to do with me! It was Ella who did it. She kidnapped Victoria.\"\nWilliam's eyes flickered. He snorted coldly and then, along with his men, drove to the abandoned factory.\nA dozen bodyguards searched the entire factory and finally found Victoria in the basement. Pushing open the iron gate, William saw Victoria lying on the ground, covered in blood, her lips purple, looking lifeless.\nHis pupils contracted, and his heart seemed to be hollowed out in an instant, the pain unbearable.\nHe squatted down to check Victoria's breathing, then placed his hand on her chest. Only when he felt her heartbeat did his own heart gradually begin to calm. He picked up Victoria and rushed out of the dilapidated building, with Harry and several bodyguards quickly following.",

        "content": "\"Get her to the hospital,\" William barked as he rushed Victoria to the car.\nHarry whipped out his phone and dialed the hospital.\nThe car zoomed down the road, and William stayed quiet, eyes down. He looked at Victoria, pale and lifeless in his arms, her face white as a ghost, with dark red bloodstains still visible on her body. It was a shocking sight.\nA thin mist clouded William's brows, and his deep eyes seemed to gather the storm clouds of an impending tempest. Blood started seeping from Victoria's wounds again, soaking William's expensive, tailored suit jacket.\nWhen they got to the hospital, Victoria was rushed into the emergency room. William stayed outside, his gaze fixed on the glowing sign above the operating room doors.\nHarry, seeing the situation, didn't say a word, just standing by William silently.\nAfter a long while, William suddenly turned to Harry and said coldly, \"Ella's getting out of hand. Teach her a lesson.\"\nWilliam thought to himself, 'I didn't want to punish Ella for Victoria's sake; I just thought she was too disobedient. If she becomes my wife, she'll be even more unruly! The Scott family's daughter-in-law doesn't need to be particularly clever, but she absolutely cannot defy me.'\nHarry got the message and replied respectfully, \"Got it, Mr. Scott.\"\nAfter nearly three hours of resuscitation, Victoria was moved to the ICU, still in a deep coma.\nWilliam hurriedly asked the doctor about Victoria's condition.\n\"The patient's internal injuries are severe. Although she's out of immediate danger, she won't wake up until tomorrow at the earliest. Plus, her back injury is quite serious. Whether there will be any long-term effects depends on her recovery. In severe cases, she might even be paralyzed,\" Dr. Parker, who had treated Victoria several times, said with a frown.\nWilliam's face instantly turned dark and terrifying. He said, \"I won't allow that to happen!\"\n\"Mr. Scott, getting angry at me won't help!\" Dr. Parker adjusted his glasses, looking a bit helpless.\nHe thought, 'Has William Scott read too many novels and lost his mind? If he really cared so much, where was he earlier? Victoria had been to the hospital several times in the past few months, each time more serious than the last. Now he wants to act all affectionate?'\nWilliam, hearing this, slightly furrowed his brows and then said, \"Treat her, no matter the cost!\"\nDr. Parker rather liked this statement. After all, in this day and age, there were very few illnesses that money couldn't cure.\nSo Dr. Parker agreed and immediately called to have a batch of special medicines airlifted from an affiliated hospital abroad to give Victoria the best treatment.\nWendy and Diana, upon learning that Victoria had been found, rushed to the hospital even though it was already midnight.\nAs soon as they entered the ward, Wendy rushed up and anxiously asked Dr. Parker, \"Where is Victoria? How is she?\"\nDr. Parker removed his mask and glanced at the two, saying, \"She's temporarily out of danger, but she still needs to be hospitalized for observation.\"\nHearing this, Wendy and Diana breathed a sigh of relief, then noticed William, who was standing nearby with broad shoulders and a distinguished demeanor.\nWendy curiously looked him over, thinking that William was really handsome! Although Diana had never met William, she immediately guessed who he was.\nShe stepped forward and introduced herself, \"Mr. Scott, hello, I'm Diana from Starry Studio Gallery. We spoke on the phone today.\"\nHowever, William responded indifferently, then fixed his deep gaze on Victoria lying in the hospital bed.\nDiana ignored his indifference. As Victoria's boss, she felt it was her responsibility to inquire about her condition. \"I need to know how Victoria went missing and why she's so badly hurt,\" Diana said.\nWilliam pressed his lips together, his handsome face showing no emotion. \"I'll explain it to her,\" he replied.\nDiana smiled and said, \"Alright then, Mr. Scott. We'll be going now.\"\nWilliam nodded and waved his hand, signaling they could leave.\nBack at the Garcia Villa, Harry, along with a bunch of bodyguards, found Zachary.\nHe relayed William's message about taking Ella on a little trip down memory lane. Zachary, who was about to hit the sack, knew right away that Willow and Ella must have done something stupid again.\nHe glared at the two angrily. Ella, hiding in Willow's arms, didn't get why William was making such a big deal out of this. Wasn't it just locking Victoria up for a couple of days?\nWhen she heard from her bodyguard that Victoria had been taken away by William, Ella didn't care. She'd done worse things before, and William had never stood up for any woman.\nIt wasn't until she saw William's head bodyguard, Harry, a former special forces captain, leading a large team to the Garcia Villa to \"escort\" her, that she realized she might have really pissed William off this time.\nTerrified, she hid behind Willow and cried, \"Mom, William must be angry. What should I do?\"\nHearing Ella's cries, Willow panicked. She soothingly patted Ella's head and then looked up at Harry. \"Sir, what do you mean by this?\" she asked.\n\"Mr. Scott just wants to take Ms. Garcia somewhere. She'll be back safe in two days,\" Harry calmly explained.\n\"What if I refuse?\" Willow snorted coldly, clearly not accepting it.\n\"Mr. Scott said that if Ms. Garcia doesn't go, the engagement between the Scott family and the Garcia family will be called off, and all joint projects will be terminated immediately,\" Harry said calmly, but with a hint of threat.\nWillow's face turned livid with anger. \"You dare threaten me!\" she shouted.\n\"Mrs. Garcia, you misunderstand. I'm just doing my duty. Mr. Scott said that if you insist on not letting Ms. Garcia go, we will have to force our way in,\" Harry said expressionlessly.\n\"You are too presumptuous!\" Willow pointed at Harry angrily.\n\"Enough!\" Zachary shouted coldly. He then stood up and walked towards Harry, saying, \"Since Mr. Scott has extended such a gracious invitation, I must show him this respect. However, I hope Mr. Scott keeps his promise and returns Ella safely in two days.\"\nHarry nodded. \"Mr. Garcia, rest assured. Mr. Scott never breaks his promises.\"\nSensing Zachary about to hand her over to Harry, Ella cried out, \"Dad, are you really going to let me suffer? I may not be as important as Alice in your heart, but I'm still your daughter, right? How can you be so heartless!\"\nHearing this, Zachary stopped, turned around, and sternly scolded, \"Shut up! Haven't you caused enough trouble? If it weren't for your stupidity, how would things have come to this? Besides, William said he wouldn't harm you. Do you really want to break off the engagement and become the laughingstock of Silvermist City?\"\nZachary didn't know what Ella and Willow had done this time, but seeing William's reaction, he knew William was truly angry. If they lost their connection with the Scott family through marriage, the Garcia family would suffer greatly.\nIn comparison, letting Ella take some punishment was nothing. Maybe she would learn to behave and cause less trouble in the future.\nHearing this, Ella fell silent. She was afraid of suffering, but she was even more afraid of losing William.\nOn one hand, she genuinely liked him; on the other, the title of William's fiancée brought her too much vanity and satisfaction. She couldn't bear to lose it.\nBut she soon regretted it when Harry took her to the basement where Victoria had been held, threw her inside, and locked the iron door.",

        "content": "Staring at the pitch-black, stinky cage, Ella screamed her lungs out, banging on the iron door. \"Help! I can't stay in here, let me out!\"\nHarry just looked at her, cold as ice. \"Mr. Scott said you need to feel this too, so you'll understand what it means to be restrained.\" And with that, he walked away without a second glance.\nElla shook the iron door, but it was useless. She was scared out of her mind, curling up on the damp, cold ground, shaking like a leaf.\nElla felt something crawling up her leg and freaked out, screaming and pounding on the door with both hands. \"Help! Somebody save me!\"\nMeanwhile, Victoria had been out cold in the hospital bed for a whole day and night before she finally woke up. When she opened her eyes, all she saw was white, and her left hand was hooked up to an IV.\nThe last thing she remembered was falling from the ventilation window. Did someone save her?\n\"Awake?\" A familiar male voice broke the silence.\nVictoria looked up and saw William sitting in a chair by the bed, his brows furrowed as he stared at her with a complicated look. He looked tired, like he hadn't slept in ages.\n\"William?\" Victoria called softly. \"Did you save me?\" she asked.\nWilliam's expression softened a bit. \"How are you feeling?\" he asked.\n\"I'm okay.\" Victoria forced a small smile. \"Thank you.\"\nWilliam frowned but didn't say anything. He hadn't seen Victoria talk to him so calmly in a long time, but it made him feel weirdly irritated.\nAfter a long silence, he finally spoke in a low voice, \"If you want to thank someone, thank Diana and your friend Wendy. They were the ones who noticed you were missing. They've come to see you several times in the past two days, but you were out cold.\"\n\"Okay, I'll thank them.\" Victoria looked down and responded quietly. Then she asked, \"Did the doctor say when I can leave?\"\n\"You need to stay for at least a week, or you'll have lasting issues with your back,\" William replied.\nVictoria just nodded and didn't say anything else. An awkward silence filled the room. After a while, Victoria looked up and said to William, \"Mr. Scott, you know who locked me in the basement, right?\"\nWilliam pressed his lips together, his eyes darkening.\nVictoria didn't expect him to answer and continued, \"It was Ella. Even though I've signed a settlement agreement with her, she still won't let me go. You know why.\"\nHearing this, William nodded slightly.\n\"Ella is spoiled and has a bad temper. She's irritable, narrow-minded, and willful, but one thing is certain: she likes you a lot...\" Victoria paused slightly.\n\"To be more precise, she admires you a lot. Love brings worry, love brings fear. She hates the women around you, especially someone like me, with whom you have an improper relationship.\" Victoria spoke calmly, like she was talking about the weather, but her tone made William's muscles tense up.\n\"As a woman, I can understand her feelings. But I've been hurt by her repeatedly, and I feel very wronged and angry. However, all of this, in the end, is thanks to you.\" Victoria looked at William, a sarcastic smile on her lips.\n\"Mr. Scott, please, for the sake of me almost losing my life several times, let me go, okay?\" she said in the calmest tone.\nWilliam's pupils trembled violently for a moment, then he suddenly grabbed Victoria's shoulder with such force it seemed he wanted to crush her bones.\nHe stared into Victoria's eyes, as if trying to see through her. \"Do you hate me that much?\" he asked.\n\"No,\" Victoria denied softly, her face still cold and emotionless. \"If it weren't for you, Nora wouldn't get hospital treatment, and Bobby wouldn't continue his studies. I have no right to hate you. I'm just scared, do you understand? I can sell myself for money, but it's not worth risking my life for it.\"\nWilliam was stunned, his eyes locked on her, sharp and intense. He wanted to see through her pale, tired face to understand her true thoughts.\nVictoria looked back calmly and coldly. As their eyes met, the atmosphere grew strange and tense.\nWilliam could clearly see his reflection in her eyes that showed no emotion, no hatred, no anger-just a plain look, as if he were an ordinary acquaintance.\nWhat she said just now was her true feelings; she really didn't want to be involved with him anymore. Realizing this, William felt a surge of nameless anger, but he quickly regained control over his emotions.\nIn the end, William released Victoria, his deep eyes shadowed with a somber look. His thin lips parted slightly as he said, \"You should rest.\" With that, he strode out and closed the door behind him without looking back.\nAs soon as William left, Victoria's heart pounded wildly. William's gaze just now was terrifying, like a beast ready to pounce and devour her. It took a lot of effort for her to appear somewhat calm.\nShe had made herself very clear just now. She thought, 'William, being the proud man he is and always surrounded by beautiful women, surely wouldn't trouble her again, right?'\nWhen Victoria fell from the windowsill, she really felt like she was going to die. She used to think it didn't matter if she lived or died; living was just painful.\nBut now, seeing a big chance to stay at Starry Studio Gallery, even as an auditor, she could re-enter the university campus to continue studying painting.\nShe hadn't felt this sense of purpose and drive in a long time.\nIt was like going back to the years when she worked hard to get into her dream university, so full of energy and hope, unlike before when she was barely alive and filled with a faint sense of death.\nShe was tired of the constant cycle of getting injured and ending up in the hospital. Now, she just wanted to do her best to stay at Starry Studio Gallery and, hopefully, go back to university to continue her studies.\nIf she could pay off Alvin's debt early and bring him out, that would be even better.\nWhile she was lost in thought, her phone rang.\nShe took out her phone and saw it was a call from Samuel.\nShe quickly pressed the answer button and asked, \"Professor Brown, is there something you need?\"\nSamuel's deep laughter came through the phone. \"Can't I call you just because?\"\nHearing this, Victoria was slightly stunned. Then she shook her head and said, \"Of course you can. I was just worried you had something urgent.\"\n\"I don't have anything urgent, just wanted to tell you that the public class on Sunday has been moved to Saturday afternoon. Can you attend?\" Samuel's tone was gentle, with a hint of inquiry.\nVictoria was stunned, looking at her hand still connected to the IV, and replied helplessly, \"I can't make it this time.\"\nAlthough she really wanted to attend, she knew which was more important-a single class or a lifetime of consequences.\nThere was a brief pause on the other end of the line before the voice slowly resumed, \"May I ask the reason why?\"\n\"I have something to do that day.\" Victoria didn't want him to know she was in the hospital and tried to brush it off.\nHowever, at that moment, the door opened.\nA nurse walked in with medication and a syringe. \"Victoria, right? It's time to change your medication!\"\nEven though Victoria covered the phone immediately, Samuel still heard the nurse's voice, and his tone became serious. \"Are you in the hospital?\"",

        "content": "Victoria hesitated for a sec but then came clean, \"Yeah.\"\n\"Which hospital?\" Samuel pressed.\nAfter a brief pause, Victoria answered, \"Dawn Healthcare Center.\"\nSamuel was quiet for a moment before saying, \"Wait for me.\"\n\"Professor Brown! You don't have to...\" Victoria started, but Samuel had already hung up. She sighed and put her phone away.\nHalf an hour later, Samuel showed up at the hospital room door, rocking a dark gray suit and gold-rimmed glasses. He had a bouquet of lilies, a fruit basket, and a few books in hand.\nVictoria had never seen him with glasses before, and now he looked like a whole different person. Gone was the casual, charming guy from art shows and lectures. With glasses, he seemed more refined and intellectual, giving off a mature vibe that made Victoria feel at ease.\n\"Professor Brown, you really didn't have to go through all this trouble,\" Victoria said politely.\nSamuel set the fruit on the table, then sat on the edge of her bed. \"Why so formal? Aren't we friends?\"\nVictoria smiled and nodded.\nSeeing her pale face, Samuel frowned. \"What happened to you?\"\nVictoria looked down, biting her lip. \"I just had a fall.\"\nSamuel could tell she didn't want to get into it, so he let it go. \"What did the doctor say? Is it serious?\"\n\"The doctor said I just need to rest for a few days. I can go home by the weekend,\" Victoria replied.\n\"That's good.\" Samuel's expression softened. \"I brought you some new books. Thought you might like them.\"\n\"Thanks, Professor Brown,\" Victoria said with a smile.\nSamuel chuckled. \"Just call me Samuel from now on.\"\nVictoria hesitated but then nodded.\nSamuel laughed. He handed her a book titled \"Art and Visual Perception\" and started explaining some key points. \"This book dives into how we see and create art...\"\nVictoria listened closely as Samuel explained. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting a peaceful glow over them. When the nurse came to ask visitors to leave, Samuel reluctantly stood up. \"Get some rest. I'll visit again when I can.\"\nVictoria smiled as she watched him leave. Once the room was quiet again, she picked up the book and started reading.\nLater, Wendy and Diana showed up with fruit and flowers. Wendy rushed over and hugged Victoria, tears streaming down her face.\n\"Victoria, you're finally awake! I was so worried,\" Wendy cried.\nVictoria felt a lump in her throat. \"Thank you, Wendy. If you hadn't noticed I was missing, who knows what would've happened!\"\nWendy wiped her tears and scolded, \"Don't say thank you; we are friends.\"\nVictoria smiled.\nDiana added, \"Just focus on getting better. We'll deal with the assessment later. No need to stress.\"\nVictoria nodded. \"Thank you, Ms. Simpson.\"\nShe had been worried about it and was planning to call Diana, but seeing her at the hospital made her feel a bit overwhelmed.\nWendy ordered some light meals, and they had lunch together in the hospital room before reluctantly leaving.\nMeanwhile, William stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window at the Scott Group, lost in thought as memories flashed through his mind like a slideshow. A flood of emotions hit him: the grief from his parents' death a decade ago, the comfort from his aunt Daisy Scott and uncle Wayne Scott promising to find the culprit.\nHe also remembered Victoria nervously applying for a receptionist job at the Scott Group, and how he instantly recognized her as Alvin's daughter. He recalled Victoria fainting when Alvin was arrested and later accepting a humiliating agreement.\nThe last image in his mind was Victoria's eyes, filled with emotion. Now, Victoria lay in a hospital bed, hoping to have nothing more to do with William. But that was impossible.\nUnless William could shake off his nightmares and the torment of the past. Otherwise, Victoria would be stuck with him until the end.\nAs William was deep in thought, the office door swung open, and Harry walked in. \"Mr. Scott, Ella has been sent back to the Garcia Villa.\"\nWilliam glanced at him and asked casually, \"How is she?\"\nHarry described Ella's miserable condition. She had been locked in the basement for two days, enduring the cold, damp darkness, insects crawling around her, and unbearable hunger.\nMore importantly, William had Harry block all the windows, so Ella couldn't see any light and had no idea how much time had passed or how long she'd be kept there. This psychological torment was worse than physical pain.\n\"When Ms. Garcia was released, she had lost a lot of weight, her cheeks were sunken, her skin was dull, and she was covered in red marks from insect bites. She seemed to have a fever,\" Harry reported.\nWilliam was silent for a moment, then asked indifferently, \"She didn't cause any trouble, did she?\"\n\"No,\" Harry replied.\nWilliam's eyes showed a hint of mockery. \"I hope she learns her lesson this time. If it weren't for...\" He didn't finish his sentence, just snorted and went back to work.\nVictoria stayed at Dawn Healthcare Center for a few more days, during which Samuel visited her several times to explain some challenging points from the books.\nWith his help, Victoria felt enlightened. She had inherited her artistic talent from her parents and had always loved and worked hard at learning art, so her skills were pretty solid.\nNow, with Samuel's guidance, many problems that had troubled her for a long time were resolved.\nAfter being discharged, Victoria returned to her job. Although she had missed a week of training, Wendy sent her daily training points, and with Samuel's professional guidance, she didn't fall behind much.\nOnce she started working again, she quickly caught up.\nThe remaining five interns not only helped adjust the gallery and introduce products to customers but also learned to acquire artworks at reasonable prices, especially those of popular artists.\nSecuring works by popular artists was crucial for the Starry Studio Gallery. It could enhance the gallery's reputation and influence, attracting more visitors and collectors. Especially now, Joshua's works were highly sought after globally.\nThe piece Victoria saw when she first arrived at the gallery had sold for a million dollars in the first week. So the interns who managed to get hold of Joshua's work had the best chance of staying on.\nHowever, Joshua was very mysterious. He only sold three or four pieces a year, all through his manager, never appearing in public. So getting his work was very difficult.\nWendy and the other three interns either used family connections to get works by foreign masters or found many new artists' works, hoping to win by quantity.\nBut Victoria wanted to try to get Joshua's work to increase her chances of staying. So she called Samuel, \"Professor Brown, you're a professor at the University of Aesthetics Shine. Can you help me find out about Mr. Thomas?\"\nSamuel was stunned for a moment, then asked, \"You want to acquire his work for your gallery?\"",

        "content": "Victoria replied softly, \"Our gallery has always been keen on Mr. Thomas's work. I want to give it a shot.\"\nAfter hearing her request, Samuel thought for a moment and said, \"Alright, I'll help you get in touch, but the final outcome will be up to you.\"\n\"Thank you, Professor Brown!\" Victoria said sincerely.\nTwo days later, Samuel sent her an address, saying it was Joshua's studio and that she should go there in person to discuss.\nAfter packing her things, Victoria immediately headed to the studio.\nThe studio was in a private villa area in the southern part of Silvermist City. As the car drove in, Victoria saw a standalone villa nestled in a tree-surrounded courtyard from a distance.\nAfter the car stopped, Victoria got out with her bag.\nAs soon as she entered the studio, Victoria was greeted by the rich scent of ink.\nShe looked around and saw that the spacious studio was filled with paintings of various styles. Some were vibrant and bold, seemingly telling passionate stories; others had delicate brushstrokes, depicting a serene and beautiful world.\nYet Victoria's gaze unintentionally fell on an unfinished painting.\nIn the painting, the outline of a girl was faintly visible.\nIn front of red walls and gray tiles, she slightly tilted her head, with a few strands of hair gently falling on her cheeks, as if lightly swaying in the breeze.\nAlthough the girl's features were only roughly sketched, one could feel the fresh and delicate beauty within.\nShe wore a light blue long dress, the hem gently swaying with her movements. Although the colors were not fully rendered, one could already sense the lightness and grace.\nThe more Victoria looked at the painting, the more familiar it became, and a strange sense of intimacy arose within her.\nShe tried to search her memory, attempting to find the source of this familiarity.\nWas it someone she had seen before?\nHer brows furrowed slightly as she fell into deep thought.\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang. Victoria turned around and saw Samuel, dressed in casual attire, walking in.\n\"You're here.\" Samuel smiled at her and gestured for her to come in, then asked, \"What would you like to drink?\"\nVictoria replied, \"Water will be fine.\"\nSamuel then turned and walked out.\nA few minutes later, Samuel came back with a glass of water.\n\"Have a seat. Joshua will be here soon,\" he said as he sat down next to her.\n\"Okay.\" Victoria nodded, but her gaze remained fixed on the unfinished painting on the easel.\nFollowing her gaze, Samuel smiled and asked, \"Do you like that painting?\"\nVictoria pursed her lips and softly said, \"Mr. Thomas must really like this girl.\"\nSamuel raised an eyebrow and asked, \"Why do you think so?\"\nVictoria slightly tilted her head, her gaze still on the painting, and slowly said, \"You can feel his delicacy and tenderness from the brushstrokes. The girl's expression is depicted so vividly, as if he knows her every move intimately. Even though the painting is unfinished, I can already feel the endless affection he put into it.\"\nSamuel's eyes lit up with appreciation when he heard this. He then said, \"Joshua has a quirky temper. What if he refuses to sell the paintings to you?\"\nVictoria chuckled and said, \"Don't worry. I knew there was a chance of failure when I took this job. I'll figure something out.\"\nSamuel nodded and smiled, \"That's the spirit.\"\nAs they were chatting, the studio door opened again, and a man wearing gold-rimmed glasses and a black suit walked in.\nThe man was tall, young, and handsome, dressed in a sports outfit. He looked more like an athlete than an artist.\nSeeing this, Victoria immediately stood up and respectfully said, \"Hello, are you Mr. Thomas?\"\nJoshua glanced at her, nodded, and smiled. \"You must be Victoria?\" he asked.\nVictoria quickly said, \"Yes, I'm Victoria from Starry Studio Gallery.\"\nJoshua looked at her and suddenly said, \"I heard you want to buy my paintings?\"\nVictoria was taken aback, not expecting him to directly mention the real reason for her visit.\nFeeling a bit awkward, she still honestly replied, \"Yes, I want to purchase your paintings...\"\n\"Sorry, I refuse.\" Joshua interrupted her without hesitation before she could finish.\n\"Why?\" Victoria asked in astonishment.\nShe hadn't expected Joshua to reject her outright. A bit anxious, she continued, \"May I ask why? If you have any conditions, please let me know. I'll do my best to meet them.\"\nSeeing her somewhat pale face, Samuel felt a bit sorry for her. He quietly pinched Joshua's back and whispered, \"Ryan, that's enough.\"\nVictoria thought Samuel was speaking up for her and gratefully smiled at him.\nHowever, Joshua glanced back at Samuel, snorted, and ignored him.\nSamuel was left speechless and could only warn Joshua with his eyes.\nBut Joshua seemed to ignore his warning and continued, \"It's not that I don't want to sell the painting to you. It's just that I already have a lot of orders and don't have the energy to take on more. However, if you and Samuel are willing to come by every week to help me with some basic tasks, like mixing colors or sketching, I might consider it.\"\nHearing this, Victoria looked at Samuel and hesitantly said, \"Mr. Thomas, I don't mind, but Professor Brown is quite busy, and I can't...\"\nBefore she could finish, Samuel interrupted, \"I can! I have time! It's a great opportunity for me to learn from Mr. Thomas.\"\nJoshua glanced at Samuel with a hint of amusement and said, \"Good to see you know your place. In that case, I'll sell you two paintings first. As long as you both keep helping in the studio, I can sell you one painting a month!\"\nVictoria was so surprised by this sudden turn of events that she didn't know what to say.\nShe didn't expect Joshua to agree so readily.\nOverjoyed, she kept nodding and said, \"Thank you, Mr. Thomas!\"\n\"You're welcome,\" Joshua said with a wave of his hand. \"But the price will still be market rate. I won't give you a discount.\"\n\"Don't worry,\" Victoria earnestly promised. \"I'll take photos and have our evaluation department assess the price. We won't let you suffer any loss.\"\n\"Alright.\" Joshua nodded in satisfaction.\nAfter taking photos, Victoria chatted with Joshua for a bit, said goodbye to Samuel, and left the studio.\nWatching her leave, Ryan Thomas patted Samuel's shoulder and teased in a low voice, \"Is she your muse?\"",

        "content": "Samuel shot Ryan a sideways glance without saying a word, then turned back to the unfinished portrait of the girl and picked up his paintbrush.\nAt that moment, Samuel's eyes were filled with tenderness and focus.\nHe gently outlined the girl's eyes with the brush, each stroke infused with deep affection.\nHer face appeared vividly in his mind-her smile, her gaze, and every detail.\nMeanwhile, Ryan stood quietly by, watching Samuel at work, and couldn't help but sigh.\nHe had never seen Samuel so absorbed in painting a picture.\nAs time passed, Samuel finally completed the outline of the girl's eyes.\nHe put down the brush, took a few steps back, and carefully examined his work.\nThe eyes seemed to come alive, clear and captivating like a bright autumn stream, as if they could see right through one's soul.\nAt that time, Ryan stepped forward, patted Samuel on the shoulder, and said, \"This painting will definitely be your masterpiece.\"\n\"I will only give this painting to its owner. There's no way I'm letting you sell it,\" Samuel said indifferently as he put the brush back into the box.\n\"Fine, don't sell it then,\" Ryan shrugged and responded. \"But why don't you just tell her you're Joshua? Why go through all this trouble, making her come over every week to paint with you?\"\n\"Pursuing a girl is a gradual process. I have to slowly become a part of her life, let her get used to my presence, and then make her fall in love with me,\" Samuel said.\n\"I didn't know you thought like that. I have to hand it to you; you're truly impressive,\" Ryan said with exaggerated pretension.\nHearing this, Samuel rolled his eyes at Ryan and just ignored him.\n\"But as far as I know, this Victoria has a close relationship with William Scott. Aren't you afraid of hitting a snag?\" Ryan couldn't help but remind Samuel.\nSamuel shook his head with a smile and replied, \"The Scott family is not a concern, and as for William, he's a fool who can't even understand his own feelings. He poses no threat to me.\"\n\"I see!\" Ryan dragged out his words, winking at Samuel with a subtle smile. \"It seems you have everything under control. Then I wish you success in winning the beauty's heart soon!\"\nWith that, Samuel glanced at Ryan disdainfully and walked upstairs.\nMeanwhile, Victoria excitedly showed the photo to Diana.\nDiana looked at it several times, confirming it was indeed Joshua's work, and said with rare astonishment, \"Are you saying Mr. Thomas is willing to sell us these two paintings and that, as long as you help him one day a week, he will sell us one painting each month?\"\nVictoria nodded affirmatively, excitedly saying, \"Yes, Mr. Thomas promised it!\"\nShe didn't expect it to go so smoothly. She thought tonight would be a wasted trip, but things took a turn for the better.\nNot only could she learn painting from Joshua, but she could also help Starry Studio Gallery acquire sought-after works. It was a win-win situation!\nHearing this, Diana also smiled with satisfaction, patted Victoria on the shoulder, and praised, \"Well done. No wonder Elara highly recommended you. Next, as long as you pass the final test, you are almost guaranteed to stay.\"\n\"Can I ask what the final test is?\" Victoria asked nervously.\nDiana looked at her with a mysterious smile and said, \"It's a secret. You'll find out once you pass the test.\"\n\"Alright,\" Victoria nodded reluctantly, silently praying that the test wouldn't be too difficult.\nThree days later, Victoria learned that Wendy had passed the final test with high marks.\nWendy had independently and excellently planned and set up an art exhibition, earning unanimous praise from the entire management and training team at Starry Studio Gallery.\nWhile Victoria was happy for Wendy, it also meant the competition pressure increased. Victoria and the other three were all determined to complete their assigned tasks.\nVictoria thought her final test would be similar to Wendy's, like organizing an exhibition or an event.\nBut boy, was she wrong.\nWhile she was adjusting the positions of paintings at Starry Studio Gallery, a man stormed in with a painting, looking furious. His brows were furrowed, and his eyes were blazing with anger.\nThe moment he entered the gallery, he shouted, \"What kind of lousy gallery is this? The painting I bought last time has a problem.\"\nHis voice echoed through the spacious gallery, drawing the attention of other customers.\nSeeing this, Victoria hurried over and said gently, \"Sir, please don't be angry. What's the problem?\"\nBut the man wasn't having it. He pointed forcefully at the painting in his hand, his voice even louder. \"I hung this painting at home for a few days, and it started to fade. Now the painting is mottled and ruined. You guys are ripping people off!\"\nHe slammed the painting onto a nearby display stand. It was indeed from Starry Studio Gallery.\nAnd as he said, several areas had faded, revealing the underlying canvas, which looked particularly abrupt and ugly.\nVictoria was just as shocked. She quickly tried to calm him down again, \"Sir, please calm down. We apologize for this situation, but rest assured, we will handle it properly and provide you with a satisfactory resolution.\"\nThe man, however, was still relentless, demanding, \"A satisfactory resolution? Your gallery sells fake and inferior paintings. You must compensate me ten times the loss, or this won't end!\"\nVictoria's face changed slightly when she heard this. She took a deep breath and tried to maintain a calm tone. \"I understand your feelings. Let's wait for the appraisal results, shall we?\" she said.\nStill angry, the man said, \"Then hurry up. I don't have time to waste with you.\"\nVictoria immediately responded, \"Sir, please provide the location where the painting was hung. I will arrange for our appraisers to check it right away. In the meantime, please rest in our gallery's VIP lounge. I'll have some refreshments and drinks prepared for you.\"\nAlthough the man was still visibly angry, he gave his address and followed Victoria to the seating area.\nIn less than an hour, the appraisers returned and re-examined the painting, then informed Victoria of the results.\nAfter learning the results, Victoria didn't immediately inform the man. Instead, she first contacted Starry Studio Gallery's art advisory team and discussed a more comprehensive solution.\nThen, she took a notebook with detailed records to the lounge and patiently explained to the man, \"Sir, our appraisers have determined the cause of the problem. The paint isn't fading because of poor quality; it's the high ozone concentration from your laser printer that's causing it. We deeply apologize for this.\"\nThe man, half-believing, said, \"Really? You're not trying to pull one over on me, are you?\"\nHearing this, Victoria solemnly said, \"We wouldn't dare deceive you. If you don't believe us, you can have it tested yourself. High ozone concentration not only damages the painting but also poses a significant long-term health risk to you.\"\nThe man was silent for a long time, still somewhat unwilling. \"But I bought this painting at a high price. Even if my printer is the issue, don't you bear any responsibility?\" he said.\nVictoria smiled and replied, \"Of course, we do. We'll not only repair the painting for free but also let you choose another piece from our gallery's collection as compensation. How does that sound?\"\nWhen he heard Victoria's offer, the man's expression softened, but he soon resumed his tough demeanor, saying, \"No, I can't just let it go. You have to repair the painting, but you also need to compensate me. After all, I bought it from your gallery, so you are responsible.\"",

        "content": "Hearing the guy's words, Victoria frowned a bit but quickly pulled herself together. \"Sir, legally speaking, this isn't our fault. We're compensating you out of goodwill. If you push for more, we'll have to go to court. We hope it doesn't come to that, but we won't back down if you keep pushing. It's the worst outcome for both of us.\"\nThe man hesitated for a moment and then gave in. \"Alright, let's do it your way.\"\nVictoria finally let out a sigh of relief.\nThat's when she noticed Diana and Frank standing nearby, watching her.\nShe realized this was her final test-handling unexpected situations.\nAnd she nailed it.\n\"Great job!\" Diana winked at her and said, \"Congrats, based on your overall score, you and Wendy have secured the permanent positions!\"\nVictoria beamed with joy and kept thanking her, \"Thank you, Ms. Simpson!\"\n\"It's all your hard work,\" Diana waved it off. \"Tonight, we'll celebrate, and tomorrow we'll sign the contract officially.\"\nVictoria nodded eagerly. Wendy joined her, and the two of them danced around in excitement.\nAt the welcome party that evening, Victoria drank more wine than usual.\nShe was over the moon.\nFrom now on, she could do the job she loved and save money to pay Alvin's compensation.\nLife finally had hope again.\nDizzy from the drink, Victoria was escorted to her apartment by someone Diana had arranged.\nBut when Victoria opened the door, she was stunned.\nA man was sitting on the sofa with his back to her, casually sipping a glass of red wine.\nHe had a tall, straight figure, wearing a black suit, with broad shoulders. Even from the back, he looked elegant and noble.\nVictoria, feeling the alcohol, stared at him blankly, momentarily forgetting to react.\nWilliam looked at her flushed face and drunken state, feeling a certain part of his body stir.\nHe swallowed hard, trying to control his desire.\n\"Had too much to drink?\" William's deep, husky voice sounded in her ear.\nVictoria suddenly sobered up a bit, her eyes widening in surprise. \"William? Why are you in my house?\"\nWilliam placed the wine glass on the table, then stood up, looking down at her with deep, probing eyes. \"Why can't I? Afraid I'll bite?\" he said.\nVictoria felt guilty under his gaze. She averted her eyes and tried to stay calm. \"I think I've made it clear. Please leave me alone, okay?\"\nWilliam snorted and mocked, \"You really think you're that desirable,\" as he took a step towards her.\nThe dangerous vibe coming from him made Victoria back up until her back was against the wall, with no way out.\nVictoria looked up at William, her lips trembling. \"What do you want to do?\" she asked.\nWilliam lowered his head, using his finger to lift her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. Her alcohol-laden breath brushed against his neck, stoking the surging desire within him that was nearly impossible to suppress.\nHe couldn't help but lower his head, whispering in her ear, \"Every time I see you, I want to fuck you, just to make you understand that you can't mess with me. That is, unless I'm done playing with you. Otherwise, don't even think about escaping from me!\"\nA chill ran through Victoria's heart, and her body trembled uncontrollably, but she stubbornly gritted her teeth and said, \"William, I have a new job and new goals now. I won't play your games anymore.\"\n\"Really?\" William raised an eyebrow. \"Is it that gallery job?\" he asked.\nVictoria nodded, \"Yes.\"\nWilliam sneered, \"Do you think getting a new job means you can escape from me? Don't be delusional!\"\nWith that, William grabbed Victoria's waist, pulling her into his arms and pressing her against his burning chest.\n\"Let go!\" Victoria used all her strength to push William away, but he held her tightly.\n\"I've already acquired nearly half of Starry Studio Gallery's shares. If you think you can escape from my grasp, you're dreaming.\" William's tone was menacing, causing Victoria's heart to contract violently.\nTo control her, he had gone to such lengths. He was simply a madman!\nVictoria felt a chill all over, fear filling her limbs and bones.\nShe stammered, pleading weakly and helplessly, \"William, please let me go. You can have any woman you want, why me?\"\n\"Because I like your body!\" William smirked, pausing deliberately before continuing. \"How could I let my prey escape?\"\nWith that, William's tongue delved into Victoria's tender lips, intertwining and tasting, savoring the moment.\nVictoria's mind went blank, with only a shred of reason left. Desperately, she bit down hard on William's lip until she tasted blood. Through her tears, she looked at him and cried, \"William, please let me go!\"\nWilliam narrowed his eyes and said coldly, \"Since you won't take a warning, then you leave me no choice.\"\nWith that, he roughly picked Victoria up and opened the bathroom door.\nThere was a single bathtub filled with warm water, a clear indication of his premeditation.\nWilliam carried Victoria inside, throwing her in without any care.\nVictoria fell into the water unprepared, the splashing water hitting her face, waking her up completely.\n\"William, what are you doing?\" Victoria frantically supported herself in the tub, looking at William warily. \"What do you want?\" she asked.\nWilliam curled his lips evilly, looking at her with a half-smile. He said, \"Why don't you take a guess?\"\nHe then unbuttoned his shirt collar as he slowly approached Victoria.\nVictoria was terrified, shaking her head in refusal. She shouted, \"No! Don't touch me!\"\nWilliam bent down slightly, one hand supporting her buttocks, the other gripping her waist, forcing her to kneel on the edge of the tub.\nVictoria's clothes were soaked, clinging to her petite and delicate body, which showcased her graceful figure.\nWilliam's throat tightened and his breathing grew heavy. \"If you won't cooperate, I'll just have to force you.\" As he spoke, his hand caressed her silky smooth skin, gradually moving up until it stopped at her full chest.\nVictoria was terrified, shaking her head and struggling. She repeated, \"William, please let me go.\"\nAt this moment, William couldn't hear Victoria's pleas. His body seemed to be on fire, ready to explode.\nHis breathing grew heavier, his eyes filled with desire. He leaned down, kissing Victoria's lips, licking and biting repeatedly until Victoria couldn't breathe, then reluctantly let go of her.\nWith that, Victoria lay limp in the water, gasping for air.\nWilliam then unbuttoned his pants, a suggestive smile on his face. He said, \"Good girl; spread your legs.\"",

He bent down and kissed Victoria's tears.\nAlready terrified, Victoria trembled all over when William kissed her like that. She said, \"Don't do this.\"\nWilliam's large hand covered Victoria's breasts, kneading them. His lips moved downward, kissing her lower abdomen.\nVictoria shamefully covered her cheeks, not daring to look at him.\nWilliam's kisses trailed down from her navel. Victoria nervously grabbed his arm tightly and, gritting her teeth, said, \"William, please, don't do this.\"\nWilliam let out a muffled groan, his voice rough and sexy.\nHis lips continued to rub against her abdomen, leaving one mark after another.\nVictoria felt her body heating up, her legs clamping tightly together, her hands involuntarily clenched into fists.\nWilliam held down Victoria's restless wrist with one hand, and with the other hand, he reached under her skirt.\nVictoria's body tensed up suddenly, her eyes filled with tears.\nShe shouted, \"William, no!\"\nBut Victoria's protest didn't earn William's sympathy; instead, it completely angered him. William tore off Victoria's panties with one hand.\nHe then lifted her long leg and thrust in forcefully.\nVictoria's pupils dilated sharply.\nThe sudden stimulation made Victoria let out a light cry.\nVictoria bit her lip hard, letting the tears slide down her pale cheeks. Her body slowly reacted to William's rhythm.\nSeeing Victoria like this excited William even more.\nVictoria closed her eyes, trying hard to suppress the waves of sensation coming from her body.\n\"Victoria, scream!\" William roared, thrusting into Victoria forcefully, each thrust harder than the last, reaching the bottom of her vagina. Victoria couldn't bear it any longer and moaned, \"No...\"\nWilliam's eyes grew darker, sweat beads forming on his forehead. The pleasure was almost driving him mad.\nHe held back the urge to shoot his load, flipping her over, making Victoria sit by the bathtub. His hands clung to her back as he thrust forcefully.\nVictoria's body rose and fell with each thrust, and her enticing moans making it impossible for William to stop.\nVictoria's tense body gradually softened as she was filled with his presence. In her intoxicated state, she couldn't help but arch her back, wrapping her legs around William's lean, strong waist.\nThe two intertwined bodies pressed against each other. Victoria's body trembled slightly, and she couldn't help but let out a moan, both charming and seductive.\nShe tilted her head back, sticking out her small tongue to lick her pink lips, her seductive appearance stunning William, who couldn't hold back any longer, thrusting into her fiercely.\nVictoria's body leaned back with each violent thrust, but she couldn't escape William's grip.\nWilliam's thrusts grew stronger, and Victoria's heartbeat went wild.\nWhen William finally released, Victoria felt a wave of heat wash over her, making her body convulse uncontrollably before she fainted.\nWilliam looked at the unconscious Victoria in his arms, his deep eyes unreadable.\nHe grabbed a towel and gently wiped her down before helping her into her pajamas, then carried her to the bed.\nAfterward, he cleaned up and held the soft, fragrant Victoria as they slept.\nVictoria slept soundly. With a warm body next to her, she felt especially peaceful.\nWhen she woke up, the golden morning light seeped through the curtains, filling the room.\nVictoria felt like she had forgotten something. She got up and went to the bathroom to wash up.\nWhen she opened the bedroom door, she smelled the aroma of food. She followed the scent to the kitchen and saw William frying eggs.\nWilliam was wearing casual clothes and an apron. His tall figure and broad shoulders exuded a strong masculine vibe.\nVictoria couldn't help but be stunned for a moment, looking at William's back. The events of last night flooded her mind-how she initially refused, and later shamelessly asked for more.\nThe most crucial thing was that she remembered William saying he had acquired shares of Starry Studio Gallery, becoming the second-largest shareholder.\nIn other words, he would still be Victoria's boss in the future!\nHer expression shifted quickly, and the joy of becoming a full-time employee disappeared like a splash of cold water.\nShe lowered her eyelashes, hiding the complex emotions in her eyes, and walked out.\nWilliam saw Victoria standing at the door, his face cold. He said, \"Breakfast is ready. Wash your hands and get ready to eat.\"\nVictoria looked at the fried eggs and toast on the table. Simple as it was, she was a bit surprised; she had always thought that someone like William, a wealthy heir, probably didn't even know how to light a stove.\nVictoria walked to the dining table, sat down, picked up the utensils, and ate silently.\nWilliam didn't mind her silence, and the two ate their breakfast without a word.\nAfter breakfast, Victoria finally looked up at William, her expression indifferent. \"Mr. Scott, I won't beat around the bush. Even though you are now a shareholder of Starry Studio Gallery, I am now a full-time sales representative at the gallery. I won't be your secretary anymore, and I don't want to be your sex object, so please let me go!\" As soon as she finished speaking, she met William's half-smiling expression. She suddenly felt uneasy, a vague sense of apprehension creeping in.\nWilliam picked up a napkin to wipe his mouth, then said with a half-smile, \"Don't worry. In two months, I'll be marrying Ella. By then, even if you want to be my sex object, you won't have the chance.\"\nVictoria was momentarily stunned. Although she had long known that William and Ella were engaged, she always felt that their personalities were so different that they would never actually make it to marriage.\nBut now, William was telling Victoria that he was getting married.\nVictoria thought, 'Does this mean that in two months, I would be free?'\nAfter the initial shock, she couldn't resist the overwhelming joy.\nSeeing the change in her expression, especially the uncontrollable joy at the end, William felt a surge of anger rising from within. He wanted to strangle Victoria.",

Deal?\"\nVictoria thought it over, then gritted her teeth and agreed.\nWilliam tossed a check at her and said, \"Here's your pay for this month. You've done well.\"\nHe patted her face and walked away.\nVictoria picked up the check, clutching it tightly. A whirlwind of emotions hit her.\nAfter a while, she finally put the check away.\nMeanwhile, Ella locked herself in her house and turned on all the lights.\nHer face was as pale as a ghost, her eyes empty and filled with fear, her body trembling like a leaf.\nThe horrifying memory of being locked in the basement kept replaying in her mind. Every detail made her shiver.\nWillow opened the door and saw Ella, who still looked terrified, even after being back for a few days. Her heart ached, and she called out, \"Ella!\"\nShe rushed over and held Ella's cold hand, trying to comfort her. \"Goodness, you look absolutely terrified! William is such a jerk! You're his fiancée; how could he do this to you?\"\nSeeing Willow, Ella clung to her like a lifeline. She cried out, \"Mom! I'm scared! There were so many bugs and rats! It was always dark! I'm so scared!\"\nHearing this, Willow hugged Ella tightly, her teeth grinding in anger.\nElla, whom Willow had pampered for over twenty years, had suffered so much.\nThe one behind all this was that wretched woman, Victoria!\nIf it weren't for that scheming Victoria seducing William, he wouldn't have made Ella suffer like this!\nWillow would never let anyone bully her Ella!\nThis time, she wouldn't let Victoria get away with it!\nBut since William was so protective of Victoria, going after her directly wouldn't work.\nWillow had to come up with a plan and use someone else to do the dirty work. She would make sure Victoria fell from grace and never recovered!\nToday, there was a small exhibition, and Victoria was chatting and laughing with Wendy while arranging the displayed works.\nSuddenly, the door burst open, and a swarm of media personnel with cameras and microphones rushed in, bombarding Victoria with sharp questions.\n\"Victoria, it's rumored that you stayed at Starry Studio Gallery by selling your body to the gallery's shareholders. Is that true?\"\n\"With just a high school diploma, how did you get into a gallery that only accepts top university graduates? Is there some shady deal involved?\"\n\"Victoria, everyone is curious, in such a tough job market, what underhanded methods you used to secure a position at Starry Studio Gallery with such low qualifications. Is your body your biggest asset?\"\nHearing this, Victoria was stunned, her face turning pale.\nShe opened her mouth but didn't know where to start.\nWendy was also shocked by the sudden scene but instinctively stood in front of Victoria, angrily saying, \"Don't talk nonsense! Victoria is not that kind of person!\"\nBut the media reporters ignored her and continued to press Victoria.\nVictoria tried to calm herself, her voice trembling. \"These are all rumors. I stayed at the gallery through my own efforts. I didn't take any shortcuts.\"\nBut her explanation seemed weak amidst the chaos.\nThe media reporters didn't believe her words.\nFlashes kept going off, lighting up Victoria's pale face.\nSeeing the chaos, Diana knew talking wouldn't help, so she called security to kick the reporters out.\nOnce the room finally quieted down, Wendy let out a sigh of relief.\nShe looked at Victoria with concern and tried to comfort her, \"Those reporters are full of it. Don't let it get to you.\"\nVictoria was still in shock from the sudden incident. Hearing Wendy's words, she forced a smile.\nDiana was also annoyed seeing the reporters still hanging around outside the gallery. She knew it wasn't Victoria's fault, but for now, she could only let Victoria stay home for a few days, for both her sake and the gallery's.\nDiana sighed and said to Victoria, \"Take a few days off. Don't come to the gallery for now, just rest at home.\"\nWhen Victoria heard this, her face turned even paler, and she stammered, \"Ms. Simpson, are you firing me?\"\nSeeing that Victoria misunderstood, Diana quickly waved her hand and said, \"No, I'm just asking you to go home to avoid any trouble. Don't worry, I've already asked the PR department to draft a statement. I know you're innocent and I won't fire you over baseless accusations.\"\nVictoria felt a bit more at ease hearing this.\nSeeing Victoria calm down, Diana arranged for someone to drive her home.\nHowever, on the way, Victoria got a call from Elara. Elara said, \"Victoria, don't go home yet. There are people swarming outside your house. Find a hotel to hide in for now; don't let them catch you.\"\nVictoria's heart sank. After comforting Elara, Victoria asked her colleague to drop her off at the nearest hotel.\nBut when Victoria was about to check in, she realized her ID was still at home.\nStanding at the hotel entrance, she looked around, not knowing where to go.\nShe took out her phone and casually scrolled through Instagram, short video apps, and Twitter, only to find them filled with slander and insults against her.\n[Victoria, that shameless bitch, will stop at nothing to climb up. She's a disgrace to the art world!]\n[How can someone with just a high school diploma get into Starry Studio Gallery? Jobs are so hard to find nowadays. Countless college graduates are unemployed, and even students from prestigious universities are struggling to find work. She must have used underhanded means to steal others' opportunities. What right does she have to stay? Get out of the art world!]\n[How dare someone who sells their body still live in this world? She's a parasite on society!]\n[Why does a high school graduate get such good resources? She must have used shady methods. Are the shareholders of Starry Studio Gallery blind to let such trash stay there?]\n[No wonder, she's Alvin's daughter, just as despicable! Trash genes!]\n[Exactly, Alvin and Victoria Carter are two of a kind-garbage!]\nOne vicious and malicious comment after another stabbed at Victoria's heart like knives.\nHer body went weak, almost collapsing to the ground.\nVictoria's hands trembled uncontrollably, and tears welled up in her eyes. She couldn't understand why people would maliciously slander her when she had done nothing wrong. Was not finishing college destined to make her feel inferior?\nEven if she gave her all and worked hard, could she still not change her fate?\nVictoria wandered aimlessly through the streets, her mind blank, feeling dizzy, with a constant buzzing in her ears.\nIt was as if the world had abandoned her.",

        "content": "William was at a business event when Harry rushed over, having seen something online about Victoria.\nWilliam's brows knitted together, and he let out a cold snort. \"Isn't she always so stubborn? Don't worry about her. Let her stew for a bit. She'll come crawling back once she learns her lesson.\"\n\"But what if she doesn't?\" Harry asked, unsure.\nA sharp look crossed William's face. \"She can't stay away from the gallery job. Just wait and see,\" he said confidently.\nHarry felt uneasy but knew better than to argue. Once William made up his mind, there was no changing it.\n\"I am off now. I'll ensure to keep you informed of any new updates,\" Harry said.\nWilliam waved him off dismissively.\nAs he glanced at the wine bottle on the table, William remembered Victoria's reaction when she found out about his engagement that morning.\nHe narrowed his eyes, picked up the wine glass with his long, clean fingers, and took a sip.\nHe was curious to see how long Victoria could keep up her stubborn act.\nMeanwhile, Victoria was wandering the streets, lost and aimless.\nFeeling a cool sensation on her face, she wiped away the tears and realized it had started to drizzle.\nHer clothes were getting soaked, and the cold rainwater trickled down her collar, making her shiver.\nShe hugged herself, curled up into a small ball, and squatted down.\nAs she cried, she suddenly started laughing-a mix of sorrow and despair.\n\"How useless,\" she murmured to herself.\nVictoria tilted her head back, closed her eyes, and let the raindrops mix with her tears.\nJust then, an umbrella appeared over her, shielding her from the rain.\nVictoria opened her eyes to see Samuel holding the umbrella. She stared at him, unmoving.\nSamuel, dressed in a camel coat and black pants, looked down at her with a mix of pity and concern.\nHe reached out, his warm hand touching her cold forehead, and asked gently, \"Why are you out here in the rain?\"\nVictoria blinked her wet eyes and gave a bitter smile. \"Professor Brown, I have nowhere to go right now,\" she said, her voice choked and hoarse.\nSamuel moved the umbrella aside, squatted down, and looked at her.\n\"It's okay; you can stay at my studio for a few days,\" he said.\nHe took off his coat and draped it over her shoulders, then gently led her to the blue Bentley parked nearby.\nSamuel had quickly contacted Starry Studio Gallery when he saw the news about Victoria and found out where she had last been seen. It didn't take long to find her.\nVictoria's cold hand was wrapped in Samuel's warm one, and she felt a twinge of emotion.\nSamuel helped her into the car, fastened her seatbelt, then got in the driver's seat and headed to the studio.\nUsing his fingerprint, he opened the studio door, and Victoria followed him in silence.\nOnly then did she realize this was Joshua's studio!\nIn the middle of the studio was a large canvas, the unfinished portrait of a woman that Victoria had seen before, now covered with a cloth.\nWhy could Samuel unlock this studio?\nVictoria's heart was in turmoil as she stared in shock at Samuel's back, struggling to believe it.\nSamuel seemed to sense her surprise, turned around, and smiled at her. \"Come on, we'll talk later. Change your clothes first,\" he said.\nHe handed Victoria a set of studio staff uniforms and continued, \"These are brand new, so feel free to wear them. I'll make you a cup of hot tea to warm you up.\"\nVictoria took the clothes in a daze and responded, \"Thank you.\"\nShe looked at the gentle and handsome Samuel in front of her, her emotions surging.\nVictoria went to the bathroom to change her clothes, washed her wet clothes, and hung them up to dry.\nShe then slowly walked into the living room, where Samuel had already prepared the cold medicine and placed it on the table.\nHe urged Victoria to drink it quickly, \"Take care of your health first. Don't worry about this matter; I'll help you.\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes to the cup of hot tea, her eyes red and brimming with unshed tears.\n\"Professor Brown, thank you,\" she murmured, \"but I'll handle this myself. I don't want to trouble you.\"\nSamuel pondered for a moment and said, \"If you want to handle it yourself, I won't interfere. But if you need my help, just let me know.\"\n\"Okay,\" Victoria responded. She then drank the steaming tea, feeling the warmth spread through her body and her mind clearing.\nShe looked around the studio and at Samuel, hesitantly asking, \"Professor Brown, why do you have...\"\nSamuel raised an eyebrow and smiled. He asked, \"Why can I open this studio door, right?\"\nVictoria nodded.\nSamuel's smile deepened. He continued, \"I'm sorry. I lied to you before. You probably guessed it; I'm actually Joshua.\"\nHer suspicion was confirmed, but she was still taken aback. She hadn't expected Samuel to be the artist Joshua, whom she had long admired.\nAnd to help her stay at Starry Studio Gallery, Samuel had willingly sold his paintings to the gallery.\nVictoria bit her lip and said seriously, \"Professor Brown, thank you. You've helped me so much. But since you're Joshua, why did you want me to come to the studio once a week?\"\nSamuel smiled slightly, his expression calm. \"I wanted to give you more time, but since someone gave me this opportunity, I had to seize it.\"\nHe stood up, walked to the covered painting, and pulled off the cloth, revealing a familiar face to Victoria-it was her own portrait.\nSeeing this, Victoria was momentarily stunned.\nSamuel took out a brush, dipped it in paint, and carefully outlined the eyes.\nHe was focused and serious, and each stroke seemingly conveyed his feelings, filled with love and tenderness.\nHis profile was flawless, his clean face like a precious gem.\nAfter he added the final flourish, the painting was truly complete.\nThe portrait of Victoria had a slight smile, her eyes full of bright joy, exuding a lively vitality, like a delicate and beautiful flower blooming in spring.\nVictoria stared at the painting, her heart racing.\nSamuel turned around, his gaze gentle, a smile in his eyes. He asked, \"Victoria, do you feel my love for you?\"",

        "content": "Samuel poured his heart into a painting, using it as his ultimate love letter to Victoria.\nVictoria was floored by the romantic and stunning artwork, her heart skipping a beat.\nBeing a painter herself, she could see the care and emotion in every line Samuel had drawn.\nShe had never seen anything so beautiful. It was like seeing a happier, livelier, but more mature version of herself.\nSamuel was wishing her happiness and hope in her future through his art.\nHow could she not feel the depth of his love?\nBut she was confused, unsure of what she had done to deserve this, and more importantly, she felt unworthy of such love.\nVictoria lowered her head, fighting back tears, and softly shook her head, her voice a bit raspy.\n\"Professor Brown, I don't get it. Why do you like me?\" She looked up at Samuel and continued, \"You know my past. How could I ever be a match for you?\"\nSamuel laughed, his bright eyes locking onto hers. \"I don't care about your past; as long as you're willing, I'll always be by your side.\" He reached out to stroke her hair, his voice low and magnetic, like a fine wine, intoxicating.\nVictoria's heart raced, too nervous to speak, avoiding his gaze in a fluster.\nShe bit her lip, her voice hoarse. \"I can't. I'm not worthy of you. We should just...\"\n\"You don't have to rush to reject me; I know this is sudden for you. Don't worry, we artists are very patient.\" Samuel gently reassured her, \"Take your time to think it over, and when you're ready, give me an answer, okay?\"\nHis eyes were so beautiful, so gentle, it was hard to refuse.\nVictoria bit her lip, trying hard to suppress the fluttering in her heart.\nAfter a while, she finally mustered the courage to nod. She replied, \"I'll think about it carefully; please give me some time.\"\n\"Okay, I'll give you time.\" Samuel smiled with relief and said, \"You can stay in the guest room upstairs for the next few days. I've just changed the sheets and bedding for you, so just rest here.\"\nVictoria nodded gratefully, then asked, \"What about you?\"\nSamuel chuckled and replied, \"Don't worry. No one will come to the studio these days, and I won't be staying here either. You've had a long day. Get some rest, and don't overthink.\" With that, he waved at Victoria, \"Get some sleep!\"\nVictoria responded and saw him out of the studio.\nAfter washing up, Victoria lay in bed, thinking about everything that had happened today.\nFirst, she was inexplicably cyberbullied, then Samuel found her, she learned he was Joshua, and then he confessed his love to her.\nHer idol, the person she had admired and adored for so long, actually liked her?\nThe anger from the cyberbullying was gradually replaced by a faint sense of joy.\nVictoria patted her flushed cheeks, muttering softly, \"Don't overthink. Victoria, calm down!\"\nVictoria tossed and turned, unable to sleep, as images of Samuel replayed over and over in her mind. Finally, she put on a coat and went downstairs.\nLooking at the portrait of herself, Victoria imagined Samuel meticulously painting each stroke, wondering if she could really be with Samuel.\nIf Samuel didn't mind the difference in their status, she could try to make up for it.\nBut right now, she was still entangled with William, how could she talk about love?\nThe thought hit Victoria like a cold splash of water. And thinking of William made her heart ache intensely.\nVictoria closed her eyes, trying to suppress the sadness in her chest.\nMaybe, after two months, when she had completely ended things with William, she could consider it.\nBut for now, the most important thing was to clear her name from the slander and online harassment.\nVictoria took a deep breath and saw the official statement from Starry Studio Gallery: [Recently, false rumors about our employee Victoria have been widely spread online. Hereby, Starry Studio Gallery formally declares that we have always adhered to professional expertise and overall quality as our hiring criteria, and asserts that there has been no illicit hiring conduct. Victoria was hired based on her own efforts and talent, and she has performed excellently in her work, making positive contributions to Starry Studio Gallery. As for the rumors, we have the right to hold rumor spreaders accountable through legal channels.]\nBut instead of calming things down, the statement just fueled the fire:\n[Victoria must be really capable, the higher-ups are rushing to protect her as soon as this scandal breaks. Who knows how many shady deals are going on behind the scenes.]\n[Efforts and talent got her hired? Are you kidding? What kind of talent can a high school graduate have if not for those shady means to climb up? It's disgusting.]\n[Having a strong background is different. Someone is always there to clean up the mess. Victoria, keep being smug; one day, your true colors will be exposed.]\n[Victoria must have pleased the higher-ups well, that's why they're protecting her!]\n[This statement is a joke. If Victoria is really capable, why doesn't she dare to respond to the netizens' doubts directly? Isn't it because she's guilty?]\nReading these nasty comments, Victoria felt a heavy pain in her chest, like a huge stone was blocking her, making it hard to breathe.\nThe worst part was that they were not only insulting her but also slandering the higher-ups of Starry Studio Gallery.\nVictoria clenched her fists. She would never let anyone defame the reputation of Starry Studio Gallery!\nEven though Samuel was willing to help her, she still wanted to solve it herself.\nShe didn't want to owe him too much.\nSuddenly, Victoria thought of someone who might be the only one able to help her now. Even though they weren't close and had some past conflicts, she still nervously made the call.\nAfter what felt like forever, Victoria finally put down the phone, a faint smile appearing on her face.\nShe calmly and composedly began recording a clarification video. In the video, she said, \"I am Victoria. First of all, I am very sorry that I have implicated the gallery where I work and consumed too much public attention for my personal issues. At the same time, I want to thank those friends and leaders who have unwaveringly trusted and supported me. Without you, I might not have had the courage to stand here and fight for myself.\"\nAt this point, Victoria stood up and bowed, then continued, \"I indeed do not have the halo of a high degree, but I have a persistent pursuit and sincere love for art. Like people who work hard for a living, I get up at six in the morning, take a bus, and then transfer to the subway for two hours to get to work. And I don't get home until eight or nine at night to have dinner. I've poured my heart and soul into every project, working tirelessly and investing immense effort. I can proudly say that every step I've taken at Starry Studio Gallery has been earned through my own hard work. If you don't believe me, just check the recently released project list from our gallery; many of the projects have my name on the staff list.\"\nVictoria paused for a moment, then continued, \"But even so, some people still think that someone without a college degree like me has no right to outshine the top students from prestigious universities. In other industries, this might not be possible, but in the art industry, a degree is not the only standard to measure a person's ability. Moreover, I was once admitted to Imagination Realm University, but due to family changes, I couldn't continue my studies. However, my teacher, Professor Johnson, still keeps in touch with me and gives me a lot of guidance. If you don't know the status of Professor Johnson, you can look it up.\"\nAt the end of the video, Victoria took a deep breath, her tone firm and powerful. \"I know that no matter what I say now, it might be questioned, but I still want to ask everyone to give me a chance and the time to prove my innocence. I'm not the despicable person you think I am; I'm just someone who works hard and chases dreams. Please believe in me and don't be misled by rumors.\"\nAs soon as the video was released, it caused a huge stir online.",

Who knows if you're just making stuff up.]\n[Don't think spinning a story will clear your name. You're just a bad person.]\nBut some folks had her back too.\n[Imagination Realm University isn't easy to get into. Getting accepted means she's got talent. Sometimes, in art, raw talent can beat formal training.]\n[Maybe we should really think it over and not be so quick to judge.]\nWhile the internet was buzzing about Victoria's video, Irvin-who had previously questioned the fairness of Victoria's success-posted his own video the next day to set the record straight.\nVictoria had called him for help, expecting a no. But to her surprise, Irvin agreed right away.\nHe said he felt bad for misunderstanding her before and now wanted to help.\nIn his video, Irvin said, \"Hey everyone, I'm Irvin. I graduated from the University of Aesthetics Shine and interned with Victoria. When I found out I lost to her, I publicly questioned how a high school student could beat me. I couldn't accept it, thinking that as a top graduate from the University of Aesthetics Shine, how could I lose to someone with just a high school education? But later, I reviewed all the scores given by our trainers. I had to admit that while Victoria's professional skills might not surpass mine, she is diligent, earnest, and attentive to customers. In practical terms, she is indeed better than us so-called top graduates. More importantly, she has a unique appreciation and aesthetic for art that hasn't been shaped by academic systems. Losing to her is not a loss. I admit my talent is not as good as hers, and there's no shame in that. I will learn from this and work harder in the future. Please stop attacking Victoria. She earned this job through hard work, not shortcuts.\"\nAfter his video, more people started believing in Victoria, especially young folks who had made it on their own.\nElla was fuming when she saw the public opinion shifting towards Victoria.\nElla had gone to great lengths to ruin Victoria's reputation.\nBut now, Irvin had stepped in and turned things around.\nElla thought, 'What kind of power does she have to make so many people want to help her? And that Lyra, she's so useless, not providing any decisive evidence, no wonder she lost to Victoria.'\nIf Ella weren't afraid that William might discover her actions, she wouldn't have had to rely on Lyra.\nElla absolutely couldn't let Victoria clear her name.\nThinking of this, Ella remembered someone and a cold smile appeared on her lips.\nShe thought to herself, 'Victoria, this time I will make sure you are utterly disgraced!'\nShe then took out her phone and made a call.\nMeanwhile, Wendy called Victoria, happily informing her that more and more people were believing in her.\nAnd the media and onlookers around Starry Studio Gallery had significantly decreased. In a few days, Victoria might be able to work normally again.\nHearing the news, Victoria was over the moon. After hanging up, she felt a huge weight lift off her shoulders.\nShe'd been stressing about getting kicked out of Starry Studio Gallery. But she never saw it coming when Bobby posted an apology video on her behalf, apologizing to the interns who got cut.\nWhile the video was presented as an apology, it was, in fact, a veiled confession that her position had been secured through backroom dealings.\nAfter watching the video, Victoria was shaking with anger.\nBobby had totally stabbed her in the back, making her look even worse!\nNora tricked her into going to the factory for money, and Bobby slandered her for cash, leading to her being cyberbullied.\nSuch was her family!\nVictoria's face went pale as she watched the internet explode with insults again.\n[Even your own brother is testifying against you. What else do you have to say? You're a morally corrupt woman, using despicable means to get ahead, pretending to be innocent. Your acting is really convincing!]\n[Do you think making a video can clear your name? You're a hypocrite, deceiving everyone from the start. People like you should be condemned by society and never escape your crimes.]\n[Artistic pursuits and hard work? It's all a sham! You're just a manipulative woman using your looks to get ahead, treating us all like fools.]\n[And that Irvin, he must be bewitched by Victoria's beauty to speak for her. So what if he graduated from the University of Aesthetics Shine? He was still seduced by this promiscuous woman.]\n[Irvin isn't a good person either. Maybe he has an improper relationship with Victoria. Chasing after beauty and lacking principles-someone like that doesn't deserve to be an artist.]\nSome radical people even went to Starry Studio Gallery to protest, demanding Victoria be fired.\nEven the house Victoria rented got vandalized with red paint, with nasty words written all over it.\nIrvin's internship place was also getting harassed, making things tough for him too.\nVictoria felt like she was being pushed to the edge.\nWilliam's eyes were dark as he looked at the growing wave of insults and slander against Victoria online, his brows furrowed.\nSeeing this, Harry softly reminded him, \"Mr. Scott, should we step in? If this keeps up, Ms. Carter might not be able to handle it.\"\nWilliam pressed his lips together, his expression grim.\nHe thought, 'This Victoria is really something. Even after all this bullying, she never thought of asking me for help.'\nWilliam had underestimated her pride and resilience.\nSeeing William unmoved, Harry tried again, \"Hugo has already given Diana an ultimatum. If Victoria can't clear her name, no matter how much Diana speaks for her, she must be fired. Although we are the second-largest shareholder, we don't have actual management rights and can't change Hugo's decision. Do you still want to wait?\"\nWilliam lowered his gaze, his long fingers tapping the table rhythmically.\nAfter a moment, he looked up at Harry, his tone cold. \"Well. I can't let her be bullied forever. Go find someone to handle this immediately and make sure to suppress the trending topics.\"\nHarry breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this, took out his phone, and was about to contact the PR department. His finger swiped across the phone, and he suddenly paused.\nHe hesitated, looking at William, wanting to say something but stopping.",

Does she need to rely on shady methods to get a gallery job? What a joke!]\nWith Joshua's backing, the internet went wild.\nPeople were initially shocked by this twist.\nIt sparked a frenzy in the comments, with many users eagerly sharing the post.\n[Oh my God, Joshua's student! That's awesome!]\n[Joshua himself got on Instagram to claim her as his student. Unbelievable!]\nSome who had previously trashed Victoria now felt pretty embarrassed.\nAt the same time, some doubted Joshua's words, thinking it might be a publicity stunt.\nBut soon, others clapped back: [Who is Joshua? He doesn't need cheap tricks for publicity.]\nAs the debate raged on, more and more people started siding with Victoria. William watched as Joshua completely flipped the script, his lips pressed into a thin line, his face serious.\nIf Victoria had come to William, he could've fixed everything for her!\nBut he didn't expect Joshua to swoop in out of nowhere!\nHe reached for his coffee, but spilled it everywhere, angrily knocking it to the floor.\nHarry quickly stepped in to clean up, sneaking a glance at William, who was sitting there radiating cold fury, and muttered, \"Mr. Scott, why'd you let such a good chance slip by? If you'd spoken up for Ms. Carter earlier, she'd be grateful and give you her all. Now, someone else beat you to it.\"\nWilliam shot him a cold look and snapped, \"Shut up!\"\nHarry quickly covered his mouth.\nWilliam squinted, a dark, complicated look in his eyes, and then said, \"Find out who this Joshua really is, why Victoria's suddenly connected to him, and why he's backing her up.\"\nHarry nodded, \"Got it, I'll look into it right away.\"\nAfter Harry left, the big, empty office was just William.\nFeeling completely out of the loop, William thought about the close bond between Victoria and Joshua, and a wave of irritation washed over him.\nVictoria stared at the Instagram post Samuel had made for her, completely stunned and unable to react for a while.\nHe actually stood up for her as Joshua!\nWasn't he worried about getting into trouble?\nHer heart was a whirlwind of emotions: gratitude, being touched, and a bit of sadness.\nThe pressure from all the public scrutiny these past days had left her anxious and sleepless. Now, seeing Joshua's statement on Instagram, she finally felt a wave of relief, her heart calming down-only to be replaced by deep worry, afraid of letting him down.\nWhen Samuel walked in with several food boxes, he saw Victoria in a daze.\nShe looked bewildered, still lost in thought.\nSamuel approached, cleared his throat, and said, \"Time to eat.\"\nHearing his familiar voice, Victoria snapped back to reality, realizing Samuel had already come in and the table was filled with delicious dishes.\n\"When did you come in?\" Victoria felt a bit embarrassed. She had been so engrossed in the screen that she hadn't noticed Samuel's entrance.\nSamuel smiled and replied, \"I've been here for a while. What were you thinking about so deeply?\"\n\"Thank you,\" she hesitated for a moment and said. \"Will saying I'm your student on Instagram affect you?\"\nSamuel handed her the utensils, smiling slightly. He responded, \"Don't you call me Professor Brown every day? It's no problem to say you're my student.\"\nVictoria looked at the food in her bowl, momentarily at a loss for words.\nSeeing her still absent-minded, Samuel sighed and said, \"If you're really worried, just work hard and achieve something to shut them up!\"\nWhen Victoria heard this, her eyes sparkled. Yes, if she were truly excellent, why should she fear those malicious words?\nThinking of this, Victoria solemnly nodded to Samuel and said, \"I will work hard.\"\n\"That's more like it,\" Samuel said with satisfaction, \"The art association is holding a competition soon. Want to give it a try? I can recommend you.\"\n\"Yes!\" Victoria immediately nodded excitedly, then hesitated, frowning. \"What if I don't win? Wouldn't that embarrass you?\" she asked.\n\"Then I'll expel you from my student list!\" Samuel teased her.\nHearing this, Victoria immediately looked distressed. She said, \"Don't scare me.\"\nSamuel placed a piece of chicken wing in Victoria's bowl, casually saying, \"I've seen your paintings. While there's room for improvement in your technique, your creativity and originality really shine through. With a little guidance from me, winning a place won't be a problem.\"\nHearing this, Victoria looked up at Samuel happily, just in time to meet his gentle and doting eyes.\nHis eyes were deep, seemingly capturing her soul, making it hard for her to look away.\nVictoria's heart trembled slightly, and she hurriedly lowered her head to avoid Samuel's gaze.\nSamuel looked at Victoria's slightly flushed cheeks, feeling a bit moved, and couldn't help but reach out to ruffle her hair.",

It's the process and details of the competition. You should start prepping.\"\nVictoria flipped through the papers and nodded. \"Okay, don't worry.

Tell us, how did you become Joshua's student?\"\n\"Yeah, we're all dying to know. Joshua is a legend in the art world, and you're his student. That's amazing!\"\n\"You really kept this a secret!

With Joshua supporting you, those rumors will definitely be dispelled.\"\n\"Yeah, we've all seen your hard work and talent. Those people were just talking nonsense.\"\nEveryone was chatting away, making the Starry Studio Gallery lively.\nHowever, Victoria noticed that Wendy was quietly staying in a corner, not saying a word.\nHer heart skipped a beat, and she walked over to Wendy, trying to be friendly. \"Wendy, I'm back.\"\nWendy glanced at her and forced a smile. \"I see that,\" Wendy responded.\nWendy didn't know why she felt this way. She had been worried about Victoria, but when she found out that Victoria was Joshua's student, she felt a bit down. She had wanted to celebrate Victoria's return, but seeing so many people around her, she felt uncomfortable and decided to stay in the corner and watch.\nYet Victoria wasn't upset by Wendy's coldness.\nShe went to the break room, made a cup of coffee, and brought it to Wendy.\nSmiling, Victoria said, \"Wendy, are you mad at me for not telling you about Mr. Thomas?\"\nWendy didn't say anything, still looking down.\nVictoria bit her lip and said softly, \"Wendy, if I told you that I didn't know the person I knew was Mr. Thomas until yesterday, would you believe me?\"\n\"Really?\" Wendy slowly looked up, her eyes filled with doubt.\nShe finally understood why she was upset. She had talked to Victoria about Joshua many times, and they both admired him. But Victoria had never mentioned that she was Joshua's student, making Wendy feel deceived. More importantly, Wendy felt that Victoria didn't consider her a true friend.\nVictoria nodded earnestly and said, \"I swear! When I met him, he used a different name. I can't tell you who he is yet, but I swear I didn't know his identity beforehand.\"\nWendy stared at Victoria, as if trying to determine if she was telling the truth.\nVictoria met her gaze steadily.\nAfter a long moment, Wendy snorted, picked up her cup, and took a sip. \"I'll believe you this time. But if you lie to me again, our friendship is over!\"\nHearing this, Victoria found Wendy's serious little round face incredibly cute.\nShe couldn't help but step forward, cupping Wendy's face in her hands and giving it a good squeeze. She said, \"Wendy, you're so cute like this!\"\n\"What are you doing!\" Wendy screamed, covering her face.\nVictoria stepped back, smiling, and enjoying Wendy's bashful annoyance that came from her light-hearted teasing.\nShe glanced at the clock on the wall and said, \"It's almost time to open. Let's get to work.\"\nWendy glared at Victoria and started her own work.\nBecause of the big news about Victoria, many people in and out of the art circle knew she was Joshua's student.\nThey came to Starry Studio Gallery out of curiosity to see what Victoria looked like.\nSome pretended to be customers wanting to buy her paintings and subtly asked her about Joshua's true identity, but Victoria handled them all skillfully.\nShe didn't mind the attention. Whether they were genuinely interested in buying art or just there to gawk, she earnestly introduced the various works at Starry Studio Gallery.\nSome people were moved by her professionalism and sincerity, and she actually made quite a few sales.\nIt was almost as much as her sales for the past half month-an unexpected surprise.\nAs she was about to leave work, her phone rang with a unique ringtone that made her shiver. When she answered, William's voice had a hint of drunkenness. \"Come to my place.\"\nKnowing what this invitation meant, Victoria gripped her phone tightly. \"I'm really tired today. Can we do this another day?\" she asked.\nHowever, William's voice turned cold. \"I don't want to repeat myself.\"\nThinking of their two-month agreement, Victoria gritted her teeth and agreed. \"Okay, I'll be there soon.\"\nWhen Victoria arrived at the Scott Villa, William was lounging on the sofa with his eyes closed.\nHe was wearing a white shirt paired with black trousers, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, revealing his strong, slender arms.\nHis features were incredibly handsome, like a male lead straight out of a comic book.\nA cigarette dangled from his mouth, the red glow flickering.\nUpon hearing her, he opened his eyes and glanced at Victoria.\n\"I'm going to take a shower,\" Victoria said softly.\nWilliam extended his hand toward her and said, \"No need. Come here.\"\nTonight, his emotions were a bit turbulent, tinged with a hint of anger.\nVictoria hesitated for a moment, then walked over to him.\nHe pressed her onto the sofa, his deep eyes fixed on her, as if he wanted to devour her whole.\nHe asked, \"How did you manage to hit on Joshua?\"",

Tell me the truth. You know I hate being lied to.\"\nVictoria steadied her breathing, slumping on the sofa like a dead fish.\nAfter a while, she sat up.\nHer pale face had a strange flush, her hair disheveled, looking somewhat pitiful.\nLowering her eyes, Victoria said hoarsely, \"I'm not lying to you. Mr. Thomas is really just a mentor I met while auditing. He took me in as a student out of pity because I was being cyberbullied, but he hasn't actually taught me anything.\"\nVictoria wasn't lying; even if William investigated, he would only find this.\nWilliam raised an eyebrow and asked, \"That's all?\"\n\"Yes, that's all,\" Victoria confirmed.\nWilliam stared at her for a while, then suddenly sneered.\nVictoria was startled, not knowing what his laugh meant.\n\"Fine, remember what you said. If you dare to flirt with other men behind my back...\" William looked at Victoria coldly, a hint of ruthlessness flashing in his eyes before quickly disappearing.\nSeeing this, Victoria felt a pang of anxiety.\nThinking of Samuel's confession, she felt a wave of bitterness surge in her heart. Her eyes moistened as she lowered her head without speaking.\n\"Alright, I've finished my questions. Now for the real business,\" William said and patted the spot next to him, signaling her to sit over.\nVictoria hesitated for a moment but eventually moved over.\nAs soon as she sat down next to William, he wrapped his arms around her slender, soft waist.\nHis warm, broad hand rested on her buttocks, kneading through the thin fabric.\nVictoria's face immediately turned red, her waist twisting, but she didn't resist for once.\nWilliam, satisfied, tightened his grip on her waist, his deep voice sounding in her ear. \"That's better. Although watching you resist is quite appetizing, it gets boring after a while.\"\nWith that, he stood up and lifted her into his arms.\nThe sudden feeling of being airborne made Victoria instinctively wrap her arms around his neck.\nWilliam carried her to the edge of a bathtub the size of half a room.\nHe kissed her small earlobe tenderly and said, \"The bathtub at your place was too small. I couldn't even exert myself properly last time; I felt really frustrated. This bathtub is big enough. How about we take a bath together?\"\nWilliam's voice seemed tinged with the steamy mist. His scorching lips fell on her neck and continued downward.\nVictoria felt a flush of heat from his shameless words, shyly turning her face away.\nSeeing this, William chuckled lowly.\nThe water was already more than halfway full, emitting a steamy heat, and both of them felt increasingly hot.\nWilliam lifted her again and placed her in the water.\nHer top was completely soaked, the thin layer of fabric becoming transparent, revealing the outline of her black underwear underneath.\nWilliam's gaze grew even more intense.\n\"Help me undress, got it?\" William said flippantly.\nHearing this, Victoria bit her lip, not moving.\n\"Unwilling? You can choose to leave, but our two-month agreement will be void,\" William said, starting to unzip his pants.\nVictoria quickly grabbed his hand, biting her lower lip. \"I'll help you undress,\" she said.\nWilliam leaned back in the bathtub, crossing his legs, enjoying the feel of Victoria's soft hands moving over his body.\nAfter saying that, she climbed off his lap, knelt down, and started unbuttoning his shirt, removing the wet garment.\nWhen it came to his pants, she hesitated.\nWilliam urged, \"Hurry up. If you take any longer, we'll starve tonight!\"\nVictoria looked up, meeting his deep, dark eyes, her heart skipping a beat.\nShe bit her lip and reached for his zipper, slowly pulling down his pants. \"Now, is this okay?\" she asked.\nWilliam, barely able to contain himself, had been suppressing his urges. He replied, \"Keep going, there's still one more.\"\nWhen Victoria heard this, her hand paused for a moment before continuing to remove his underwear.\nWhen their bodies were completely exposed to each other, his erection was already standing at attention for her.\nVictoria's face suddenly burned, her head lowering even further.\n\"It's not your first time. Do I need to teach you what to do next?\" William teased deliberately.\nVictoria looked up, her eyes misty, looking particularly enticing.\nWilliam felt like he was about to explode from holding back, but he still restrained himself, urging, \"Hurry up, use your mouth.\"\nVictoria's face turned crimson. Although she had been with him many times, she had never given him a blowjob.\nNow being forced, her heart raced, her legs stiffening.\nWilliam continued, \"Hurry up. I'm waiting for you to please me!\"\nVictoria licked her dry lips, slowly bending down.\nShe approached his firm waist, extending her pink tongue to gently lick his erection.\nEach touch sent a tingling sensation through him, William squinting his eyes, his Adam's apple bobbing as he let out a low growl.\nHe felt like all the blood in his body was rushing to one place, ready to burst out.\nHe groaned, grabbed her shoulders, and began thrusting rapidly into her mouth.\nVictoria felt like her throat was being pierced.\nShe was extremely uncomfortable, unable to help but whimper.\nSeeing this, William pulled his erection out of her mouth.\nHe lifted her onto his lap, gripping her waist, and thrust into her forcefully.\nVictoria cried out, her body trembling from the impact.\nHer cheeks were flushed, looking beautiful and alluring, her eyes gazing at him with deep affection.\nShe originally had a pure and delicate appearance, but now, her brows and eyes had taken on a seductive charm.\nWilliam's gaze deepened as he leaned forward to press against her. His voice was hoarse as he murmured, \"Baby, you're such a tempting enchantress!\"\nVictoria's face turned even redder at his words, her body going limp.\nShe stammered, \"I'm not...\"\nHowever, William rudely covered her lips, prying open her teeth, and entangling her tongue with his.\nHis lips trailed down, gently nibbling on her nipples, while his lower body continued to thrust into her.\nVictoria felt like her body was floating on clouds, as if she was about to leave the earth.\nTheir breathing grew heavy.\nWilliam's breathing became labored, sweat beads forming on his forehead.\nVictoria felt like she was about to suffocate, her strength completely drained.\nFinally, William was released.\nVictoria lay in his arms, panting heavily, her cheeks flushed, looking so beautiful that he couldn't get enough of her.\nHe then carried her out of the bathroom.\nVictoria, completely exhausted, let William carry her to the bed, cover her with a blanket, and then press down on her again, continuing to explore her with vigor.\nThey tangled on the bed for a while until Victoria was so tired she was about to fall asleep.\nWilliam held her in his arms, looking at her with an inexplicable expression. He said, \"There's a business dinner tomorrow. You're coming with me.\"\nVictoria, barely hearing him, responded perfunctorily before closing her eyes and drifting off to sleep.",

        "content": "The next morning, Victoria woke up still wrapped up in William's arms.\nShe quietly opened her eyes and saw his chiseled profile.\nThe warmth from his body made her skin feel unusually hot.\nHis arm was like a vice, making it impossible for her to wiggle free.\nShe tried to push him gently, but he didn't budge.\n\"William,\" she whispered.\nNo response.\nVictoria frowned and tried to wriggle out of his grip.\nSuddenly, William rolled over, pinning her beneath him. \"Didn't anyone ever tell you not to squirm in a man's arms first thing in the morning?\" he said.\nShe felt his morning wood pressing against her and froze.\nHer eyes widened in disbelief.\nThey'd gone at it several times last night. Wasn't he tired?\nWas this guy for real?\nWilliam raised an eyebrow and teased, \"What's on your mind?\"\n\"Nothing,\" she said, quickly looking away.\nSeeing she wasn't lying, William let it go. He released her, sat up, and said, \"Get up, it's time for breakfast.\"\nHe got out of bed, got dressed, and left the room.\nVictoria got up, put on the spare clothes she had brought, and freshened up.\nShe headed to the dining room.\nWilliam was already dressed in a white suit, standing by the window, talking on the phone.\nA gentle smile, one she'd never seen before, spread across his face. \"Yeah, I just got up,\" he said.\nSeeing her, he pointed to the breakfast spread on the table.\nVictoria sat down and started eating her oatmeal.\n\"Okay, take care,\" William said into the phone.\nAfter hanging up, he looked at Victoria and smiled. \"You've been more obedient than I expected lately.\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes and said, \"You promised me freedom in two months. I should be smart and not piss you off.\"\nWilliam's good mood vanished. He sneered, \"Since you're so sensible, I hope you'll be just as obedient at tonight's business dinner.\"\nVictoria frowned. \"What business dinner?\"\n\"Didn't you agree last night? Or are you planning to back out?\" William's tone was threatening.\nVictoria remembered his demands from last night. Did she agree to something?\n\"Alright,\" she sighed. \"But at least tell me who I'm dealing with!\"\nWilliam, satisfied with her compliance, said, \"Remember Kirk and Rufus? You promised them you'd follow up on that project, but then you quit. The project's almost done, and they specifically asked for you tonight.\"\nVictoria remembered Rufus's lecherous looks and felt disgusted.\nBut she didn't want to anger William.\n\"I'll come after work,\" she reluctantly agreed.\nShe grabbed her bag and left for work.\nWilliam watched her go, his gaze unreadable.\nHe thought, 'Victoria, I gave you a chance, but you didn't take it. Don't blame me for teaching you a lesson.'\nAfter a long, grueling day at work, Victoria felt like her legs were about to give out.\nShe rubbed her sore legs and turned down Wendy's dinner invite.\nShe freshened up her makeup to look a bit more alive and grabbed a cab to the address William had given her.\nWhen she found the private room, she pushed the door open and stepped inside.\nBesides William, the only other people there were Kirk and Rufus, who she'd met before.\nRufus's eyes roamed over her shamelessly, while Kirk was busy chatting with William about the project's profits.\nVictoria hated the way Rufus looked at her. She lowered her head and softly said, \"Sorry I'm late.\"\nRufus patted the seat next to him and smiled warmly, \"Ms. Carter, come on in. Have a seat and make yourself comfortable.\"\nHis eyes stayed glued to her, making her feel grossed out.\nShe hesitated, but William gave her a look that told her to sit next to Rufus.\nReluctantly, she sat down.\nRufus's eyes lit up. He put his hand on her shoulder and leaned in closer.\n\"Ms. Carter, since you're late, you owe us three drinks,\" he said.\nVictoria instinctively pulled away, grabbed a glass of wine, and downed it in one go.\nThe wine spilled down her neck and into her collarbone, hinting at her cleavage.\nRufus's gaze was burning into Victoria.\nVictoria's face darkened, and she awkwardly adjusted her neckline to cover up.\nRufus licked his lips, looking unsatisfied.\nWilliam watched Rufus's behavior with growing impatience, sipping water to hide his disgust.\nIf his grandfather hadn't disapproved of him and hadn't pushed him to forge his own path, he wouldn't have to deal with people like Rufus.\nBut William thought using Rufus to teach Victoria a lesson wouldn't hurt. She'd lied to him about Joshua, and if he didn't put her in her place, she'd get too bold.\nA sinister smile crept onto William's face.\nRufus couldn't take his eyes off Victoria.\nHe moved closer, touched her arm, and said, \"One glass isn't enough; we agreed on three.\"\nVictoria felt sick under his gaze. She forced herself to stay calm and said, \"Mr. Chapman, you're doing great. Why make things hard for me?\"\nRufus squinted, displeased. \"What? Ms. Carter, you weren't like this before. Think the project's done, so you don't need to humor us anymore?\"\n\"Mr. Chapman, you're joking. How could I dare?\" Victoria forced a smile and apologized.\nRufus, pleased, patted her shoulder.\n\"Ms. Carter, you're straightforward. Let's keep drinking,\" he said, handing her another glass.\nVictoria reluctantly took it and drank.\nShe glanced at William, but he was indifferent, laughing and chatting with Kirk.\nHer heart sank.\nShe knew William was making things hard for her because of the Joshua incident.\nVictoria smiled bitterly. Even after last night, William had no mercy.\nSuch a William was truly terrifying.\nShe put down the glass and said, \"Excuse me, Mr. Chapman. I need to use the restroom.\"\nWithout waiting for his permission, she headed to the restroom and vomited.\nAfter washing her hands, she was about to leave when someone grabbed her wrist.\nShe turned and met Rufus's lecherous gaze, making her scream and step back. \"Mr. Chapman, you...\"",

Be my woman, and I'll make sure you're happy,\" he slurred.\nAs he spoke, Rufus shut the bathroom door and reached for Victoria's chest.\nVictoria screamed, quickly covering herself and struggling desperately.\n\"Let go!\" she shouted.\nShe fought with all her might, but Rufus's grip was too strong.\nRufus laughed, holding her tightly with both hands.\nUnable to break free, Victoria kicked and hit him with everything she had.\nBut how could a frail woman overpower a fat man?\nWilliam and Kirk were deep in conversation when they heard the commotion from the bathroom and immediately stopped talking.\nKirk knew exactly what kind of person Rufus was.\nHe glanced at William to gauge his reaction.\nBut William's expression remained unchanged, cold as ice.\nKirk then touched his nose and continued chatting, pretending he hadn't heard anything.\nOn the surface, William appeared calm, but under the table, his hand was clenched into a fist, veins bulging.\n'Damn it! Doesn't Victoria know to ask me for help?' he thought.\nJust because she was mad at him, she'd rather be violated by that ugly Rufus?\nVictoria wanted to call for help, but her throat, sore from being choked by William the night before and the alcohol just now, burned with pain. Combined with the alcohol she had consumed and her overwhelming fear, she couldn't speak.\nShe could only let Rufus tear open the buttons on her shirt, pinning her hands above her head against the wall.\nRufus's alcohol-laden mouth kissed Victoria's delicate neck.\nVictoria felt extremely nauseous, but her body was limp, unable to muster the strength to struggle.\nShe looked at the bathroom door in despair, hoping that William would remember their time together and come to her rescue.\nShe desperately tried to shout, \"William, help me!\" But no sound came from her throat.\nHowever, the commotion in the bathroom was too loud for those outside not to hear.\nThe only reason William hadn't reacted must be intentional.\nHe was deliberately letting someone humiliate Victoria, to get back at her!\nIn his eyes, she was nothing more than a whore to be humiliated.\nWhen she realized this, her heart was filled with despair.\nBut the more desperate she felt, the more she couldn't belittle herself.\nShe had a new job and new friends. William couldn't, and didn't deserve to, ruin her life.\nRufus's repulsive, fat hand had already reached under her skirt, moving upward.\nIn an instant, Victoria became fierce. Her hands and feet were restrained, but she still had her mouth!\nShe used all her strength to bite Rufus's ear, tearing off a large chunk.\n\"Bitch!\" Rufus cried out in pain.\nFurious and humiliated, he raised his hand and slapped Victoria hard.\nVictoria fell to the ground, her cheek quickly swelling and reddening.\nIgnoring everything else, she got up and ran out of the bathroom.\n\"Stupid bitch!\" Rufus cursed and chased after her.\nVictoria stumbled to the table, not caring about William's extremely displeased expression.\nShe grabbed a wine bottle and smashed it over Rufus's head as he caught up.\nCaught off guard, Rufus took the hit to the forehead, blood splattering everywhere.\nHe glared at Victoria, seething with hatred. \"You bitch, how dare you hit me? I'll kill you!\" he snarled, swinging his fist at her.\nVictoria, exhausted, couldn't dodge, watching helplessly as Rufus lunged at her.\nAt the critical moment, William stood up, grabbed Rufus's fist, and kicked him away.\nRufus hit the ground, screaming in pain.\nSeeing Rufus in such a state, Kirk quickly checked on him and found that, aside from the missing chunk of his ear, he was mostly unharmed.\nHe then glared at Victoria and William and said, \"What are you doing? This was supposed to be a celebration, and now you're trying to kill him?\"\nWilliam shielded Victoria behind him, his gaze deep and cold.\n\"Don't you know what filthy thing he did?\" William asked.\nKirk was momentarily stunned, then laughed, \"Mr. Scott, you can say whatever you want, but do you have any evidence?\"\nThis seemed to remind Rufus, who struggled to his feet and shouted, \"Who the hell do you think you are? Didn't you give her to me yourself? Now you're playing the hero?\"\nWilliam stiffened, glancing back at Victoria, who still had her head down, her expression unreadable.\nSeeing this, Rufus grew even more arrogant and sneered, \"William, you got tired of Victoria and tossed her to me. Now you're pretending to be righteous? How disgusting.\"\nWilliam's face darkened, almost dripping with anger, and he roared, \"Shut up!\"\nRufus laughed maniacally and said, \"Who do you think you are? Telling me to shut up? Do you believe I'll terminate our contract right now and make you lose everything?\"\nHearing this, William laughed, but his eyes grew colder.\nHe suddenly walked over to Rufus, squatted down, and patted his flabby face. \"Do you think you can offend me so easily? I tailored products for your company, knowing all your strengths, weaknesses, and even your secrets, like your tapioca-free tapioca flour,\" he said.\nRufus and Kirk's faces turned pale; they didn't expect that William even knew about that.\nWilliam stood up, looking down at them. He continued, \"I hope you'll double the advertising fee for the Scott Group's hard work, or I might start talking.\"\nWith that threat, William pulled Victoria away.\nRufus and Kirk exchanged glances, and after a while, Kirk sighed, \"Rufus, we've really lost big this time.\"\nRufus's face turned ashen as he realized he had been set up by William-using Victoria to create a rift and then seizing the opportunity to extort more investment. Utterly cunning.\nHe gritted his teeth, eyes filled with malice. \"Once I deal with William, I'll skin him alive and sell that slut Victoria as a prostitute!\" he spat.\nWilliam led Victoria out of the hotel and into his dark blue Maybach, where Harry immediately drove away. Throughout the ride, Victoria kept her head down in silence. William, feeling inexplicably guilty, reached out to wipe the blood from her mouth, but she turned her head away.\nThe car fell into a suffocating silence.\nWilliam couldn't stand the silence. He suddenly asked, \"Why didn't you call for my help earlier?\"",

With a voice dripping with annoyance, he snapped, \"Talk to me!\"\nVictoria glanced up, her eyes welling up with tears. She bit her lip, shaking as she tried to get the words out.\nBut as soon as she tried to speak, she felt as if she was choking, with her throat burning intensely, and her eyes got even more watery.\nWilliam's chest was heaving, his face turning a nasty shade of red.\nTrying to keep his anger in check, he softened his tone a bit and said, \"Alright, whatever happened is done. Don't worry, I'll make sure you get justice!\"\nHearing this, Victoria thought, 'So this is William-so cunning, so heartless! He never saw me as an equal.'\nTo him, she was just a tool, a pawn he could use, someone he could insult and trample on whenever he wanted.\nYet she still had hopes for this cruel, heartless devil!\nHow ironic!\nVictoria suddenly felt exhausted, a wave of weariness washing over her, and she slowly closed her eyes.\nWilliam saw her unresponsive demeanor, and his mood hit rock bottom.\nClearly, Victoria hadn't asked for his help, yet now she looked like she was on the verge of death.\nHadn't he already taught that jerk a lesson for her?\nWhat more did she want?\nDid she expect him to apologize?\nWilliam felt extreme disgust.\n\"Since you don't want to talk to me, I won't waste my time. Harry, stop the car!\" he barked.\nStartled and unsure of what had ticked William off, Harry quickly hit the brakes and pulled over.\nWilliam opened the car door, got out, walked to the other side, and yanked Victoria out.\nHis grip was too strong, causing Victoria to stumble and fall awkwardly onto the road.\nWilliam looked down at her, his gaze icy. He said, \"Victoria, you better understand your place. You're nothing but a plaything I bought. You have no right to throw a tantrum with me!\"\nHe paused, then added, \"If you keep pissing me off, you'll regret it!\"\nBut Victoria gritted her teeth, lifting her defiant eyes to meet his cold, bone-chilling gaze, and finally forced out a single word: \"Whatever!\"\nEven saying just one word made her throat burn painfully.\nWilliam's anger flared up when he sensed her stubborn attitude, and he kicked her in the stomach.\nVictoria let out a muffled groan, collapsing to the ground.\nShe propped herself up on her knees, curling her body, her shoulders trembling slightly as if crying, but she tried hard not to make a sound.\nSeeing her in such pain, William regretted his impulsiveness.\nBut apologizing to her? No way.\nHe thought Victoria needed to suffer to learn her lesson.\nSo William gave her a cold glance, then turned and got back into the car.\nHarry looked at Victoria's miserable state in the rearview mirror, then at William's tense profile, feeling a mix of emotions.\nVictoria, such a tough girl, would rather take a beating than beg for mercy.\nBut William was heartless, completely ignoring her feelings.\nGlancing at William in the back seat, Harry couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Scott, it's pitch dark. Are we really going to leave Ms. Carter here?\"\nWilliam waved his hand impatiently and said, \"Enough, just drive! Isn't she tough? Why are you worried about her?\"\nHarry sighed and stepped on the gas.\nVictoria lay on the ground, her back aching from the cold, but she stubbornly stayed silent.\nThe shadows of the trees above fell on her pale cheeks, making her look even more desolate and lonely.\nShe lay there, staring at the gray, hazy night sky.\nShe was never one to give up easily, but today, she suddenly felt tired of living.\nNora, always scheming to take from her.\nBobby, backstabbing her for his own gain.\nAlvin, the only one who cared for her, suffering in prison, and she could do nothing for him.\nAnd here she was, selling her body, selling her dignity, yet still holding onto a sliver of hope that William, who bought her, would show her some pity.\nIt turned out to be her Stockholm syndrome manifesting as a masochistic tendency.\nShe was utterly despicable, both mentally and physically!\nShe had never hated herself so much for clinging to life.\nThe sound of a text message suddenly broke the silence of the night.\nVictoria was momentarily stunned before reacting.\nShe struggled to sit up, fumbled for her phone in her bag, and swiped the screen to check.\nIt was from Samuel: [How's the preparation for the competition going?]\nVictoria's fingers trembled slightly as she held the phone, and it took her a while to reply: [I'm preparing.]\n[Samuel: Okay! Keep it up! You are the 'Wounded Angel,' and one day you will rise towards the sun!]\nVictoria stared at the words on the screen for a long time before slowly locking the screen.\n\"The Wounded Angel\" was a famous painting by the symbolist master Hugo Simberg.\nIn the painting, two boys carried an injured angel on a stretcher.\nThe angel's eyes were bandaged, its wings battered, but it held a few snowdrops in its hands.\nDespite the image's sense of decay, desolation, and negativity, the snowdrops symbolized healing and rebirth, representing hope for the future even when severely wounded.\nIt gave people the courage to persevere through hardships.\nVictoria understood Samuel's intention.\nIn this world, besides Alvin, there was Samuel who cared for her.\nVictoria felt a warmth in her heart, her nose stinging, and her eyes misting with tears.\nShe struggled to get up from the ground, her body still swaying slightly.\nLeaning against the wall of the alley, she slowly moved forward.\nOthers might bully her, insult her, or look down on her, but would she just accept it?\nNo, she wouldn't.\nShe would live out her abilities and values, making everyone look at her in a new light.\nEven if she was humble to the dust, she would never again bow and scrape, allowing others to trample on her.\nVictoria wiped the tears from her cheeks and, with heavy steps, took a shortcut to the subway station.\nMeanwhile, William sat in the car, his face so cold it seemed to solidify.\nThe recent scene replayed in his mind, and he felt a twinge of softness.\nHe rubbed his temples, exhaling irritably.\nVictoria was like a poison!\nWhenever William encountered her, he lost his rationality.\nWilliam sighed deeply and ordered Harry, \"Turn back!\"",

Her clothes were a mess, and she was half-squatting, clutching her stomach in pain.\nThen her phone rang.\nShe pulled it out, saw who was calling, and froze.\nA bitter smile crept onto her pale face.\nThey were done, and now William wanted to call and rub salt in the wound?\nWithout a second thought, she hit reject.\nAfter that, she blocked his number.\nToday, she had played her part in the scheme and made back a hundred times what he had spent on her.\nFrom now on, she wanted nothing to do with him.\nWilliam stared at the disconnected call, his brows knitting together, lips pressed tight.\nWas Victoria out of her mind to hang up on him?\nHarry glanced in the rearview mirror, saw William's stormy expression, and wisely kept his mouth shut.\nThe air in the car was so thick that it felt like you could hardly breathe.\nWilliam gripped his phone, anger bubbling up inside him.\nHe had swallowed his pride to come back for her and even called her.\nHow could she be so ungrateful?\nHarry sneaked another look at William and cautiously asked, \"Mr. Scott, should I take you home now?\"\nWilliam shot him a frosty glare, and Harry clammed up, not daring to say another word.\nWilliam swallowed his anger and called Victoria again.\nThis time, he got a message saying the call couldn't go through.\nHis face darkened even more. He looked at Harry, an idea forming. \"Give me your phone!\"\nHarry handed it over, and William quickly dialed Victoria's number.\nThe call connected, but she hung up again.\nWhen William tried again, it wouldn't connect.\nIn a fit of rage, William hurled the phone at the windshield, shattering it.\nThe loud crash echoed in the car, then silence fell.\nWilliam clenched his teeth, veins bulging on his forehead.\n'Damn Victoria! Blocking my number? Does she really think she's that tough? Let's see how she manages without my protection. What can her weak self do?'\n\"Drive!\" William barked, his anger palpable.\nHarry shivered, glancing sadly at his shattered phone.\nDid William forget it was his phone?\nAnd it was brand new!\nHarry felt like crying but started the car in silence.\nVictoria dragged herself home, exhausted.\nIt was dark, no lights on.\nShe didn't bother turning them on, heading straight to her easel and switching on the wall lamp.\nThe dim light cast shadows around the room.\nShe didn't change out of her dirty clothes or tend to her small cuts and bruises.\nShe picked up a charcoal pencil and started sketching.\nShe wanted to capture her sadness and frustration.\nBut more importantly, she wanted to convey her resolve to live well in her sketch.\nVictoria lost track of time as she drew.\nHer legs were numb, her wrist stiff, and she could barely hold the pencil anymore.\nBut when she saw the finished sketch, a faint smile of relief crossed her lips.\nThe drawing showed a dark forest with twisted trees, their branches tangled together like a giant cage.\nThe ground was littered with fallen leaves and dead branches, giving off a sense of decay.\nIn the heart of the forest, a white deer lay curled up, its fur a bit messy. It looked up at the blue sky with eyes full of emptiness and despair, but also a hint of hope and struggle.\nAround the deer were broken mirror fragments, reflecting its shattered past. But on its back, a pair of magnificent wings were slowly growing. These wings were colorful and dreamlike, the feathers gently fluttering, ready to break free and soar into the sky.\nVictoria put down the charcoal pencil, leaned against the drawing table, and let out a long sigh of relief.\nShe then stripped off her dirty clothes, tossed them in the trash, took a shower, and changed into clean pajamas.\nShe applied ointment to her wounds and drank some syrup to soothe her throat.\nAfter all that, she collapsed into bed and fell asleep, exhausted.\nThe next morning, the warm sun broke through the clouds and shone on the roof.\nSunlight streamed through the curtains, chasing away the cold of the previous night.\nHer body and throat still ached a bit, but it was nothing new for Victoria, who was used to getting hurt.\nWhile she was washing up, she heard a knock on the door.\nElara came in with a bowl of oatmeal, concern in her voice. \"Victoria, why did you come home so late again last night? I heard noises in the middle of the night.\"\nShe looked at Victoria's pale, tired face with worry.\nVictoria felt a bit warm inside but held back her tears, managing to say, \"Elara, don't worry. I just went out with friends yesterday.\"\nElara handed her the bowl and said softly, \"That's good. I thought you had to work overtime at the gallery.\"\nVictoria took the bowl, scooped up a spoonful of oatmeal, and ate it.\nThe sweet taste spread in her mouth, making her feel a bit better, even though her throat was still sore.\nVictoria looked up and gave Elara a bright smile, hoarsely saying, \"Thank you, Elara.\"\nElara gently patted her head and said, \"No need to be formal with me. Eat it while it's hot. I spent a long time making it.\"\n\"Okay.\" Victoria nodded.\nWatching Victoria eat breakfast, Elara felt a surge of affection.\nShe was such a good girl, so obedient and capable.\nIt was just a pity that Victoria had had some unfortunate family issues.\nElara looked around and noticed that it was almost winter, and Victoria still had thin bedding and sheets.\nVictoria must be too busy with work to have time to change to thicker bedding.\nThinking of this, Elara said, \"Victoria, it's been getting cold lately. If you don't mind, I can take out your winter clothes and change the bedding for you, okay?\"\nHearing this, Victoria was momentarily stunned and quickly shook her head. \"No need, Elara. I can take care of it myself over the weekend.\"\nElara scolded her gently, \"You're being too formal with me. I see you as my own daughter. Are you going to distance yourself from me?\"",

        "content": "Victoria looked down and murmured, \"Thanks, Elara.\"\n\"Not at all, Victoria. Let's eat,\" Elara said, giving her shoulder a gentle pat.\nLater, Victoria gathered her stuff and headed to work. Before she left, she gave Elara a tight hug.\n\"Elara, thanks a lot,\" she said.\nElara was taken aback for a second. She softly stroked Victoria's hair and reassured her, \"You're welcome, Victoria; just focus on your job.\"\nAfter Victoria left, Elara started sorting through Victoria's seasonal clothes.\nSince the weather was nice, she decided to wash Victoria's bedding and other laundry.\nWhile she was busy, there was a sudden loud knock on the door.\nElara frowned.\nCould it be some kid messing around?\nShe sighed, opened the door, ready to give the person a piece of her mind.\nTo her surprise, standing at the door were Ella and Willow, both dressed to the nines.\nThey had planned to ruin Victoria's reputation through Lyra.\nBut they didn't expect Joshua to show up and wreck their plan.\nSo they had lost millions of dollars for nothing.\nElla and Willow weren't about to let this slide.\nWith the wedding coming up, they were even more frustrated with nowhere to vent their anger.\nSeeing all their schemes fail, Ella and Willow feared that if they tried anything more drastic, William would get really mad and call off the wedding. After a long discussion, they decided to confront Victoria directly. Whether by bribery or threats, they were determined to make her leave William, and even if it caused a scene, they were confident it wouldn't affect them.\nSo Ella and Willow went straight to Victoria's house and rang the doorbell.\nElara didn't recognize Ella and Willow and thought they were Victoria's friends because of their fancy clothes.\nSo she politely asked, \"Are you here to see Victoria?\"\nIn a fit of rage, Willow just ignored Elara. She shoved her aside and yelled, \"Where's that bitch Victoria? Get her out here!\"\nElara was almost knocked over by the sudden push.\nHearing Willow call Victoria a bitch, she immediately glared.\n\"Who are you? How dare you insult Victoria!\" Elara demanded sternly.\n\"Who we are is none of your business! I just want to know where that slut Victoria is! Get her out here!\" Ella pointed at Victoria's room and screamed.\nElara, usually calm, couldn't take it anymore.\nShe grabbed Willow's arm and shouted, \"Leave now, or I'll call the cops!\"\nElara's actions made Willow even angrier.\n\"Call the cops? That's a joke!\" Willow laughed and continued, \"Go ahead. Let's see if they arrest us or that slut Victoria for seducing my daughter's fiancé! Shameless!\"\nElara wiped the spit off her face in disgust and said, \"You must be mistaken. Victoria isn't like that!\"\n\"If not her, then who?\" Ella sneered, \"She's been sleeping with my fiancé countless times as his secretary and taking a lot of money from him every month to treat her mother. How do you think a little secretary can afford to keep her mother in the hospital?\"\nElara's face went rigid, and she started to wonder if Ella and Willow might be telling the truth.\nBut she stubbornly defended Victoria, \"You're lying! Victoria isn't like that!\"\n\"You're still defending that bitch!\" Ella fumed. \"Do you think I won't trash this place right now?\"\nShe started to break things, but Elara held her back.\n\"Let go of me!\" Ella struggled angrily.\nElara gripped Ella's arm tightly and said, \"Let's sit down and talk. Don't do anything crazy!\"\n\"You bastard, blocking my way. I'll teach you a lesson today!\" Ella grabbed Elara's hair and yanked hard, cursing nonstop.\nElara, usually calm, was completely enraged by Ella's actions.\nShe lunged at Ella, and they started fighting.\nElara tried to scratch Ella's face, while Ella flailed her arms to fend her off.\nSeeing Ella fighting, Willow couldn't just stand by and rushed to help.\nShe grabbed Elara's arm and cursed, \"Mind your own business! Today, you'll see just how powerful we can be!\"\nElla pulled Elara's arm forcefully and occasionally shoved her.\nWillow and Ella beat Elara badly.\nFinally, the community security called the police.\nMeanwhile, Victoria had been busy working all day. Her throat was sore, so she didn't go out to greet customers.\nInstead, she was adjusting the display of her works and organizing materials.\nAfter a long day, she had just sat down to rest when she got a message from a stranger claiming to be Elara's son.\nVictoria immediately took a cab to the hospital.\nElara was badly injured, with a gash on her forehead, a twisted waist, and bruises and scratches all over her body, looking very frightening.\nSeeing Elara, who had been so full of energy in the morning, now in such a state, brought tears to Victoria's eyes.\nShe held Elara's swollen and bruised hand and said hoarsely, \"Elara...\"\n\"Why are you crying?\" Elara lay in bed, enduring the pain. She said, \"Don't worry. They didn't get away unscathed. I scratched their faces!\" Elara showed a hint of pride.\nHearing Elara's words, Victoria cried even harder.\nShe choked, \"I'm sorry. It's all because of me that you got hurt so badly.\"\n\"Silly girl.\" Elara lovingly stroked Victoria's long hair and comforted her, \"Stop crying. I'm fine. But your voice sounds hoarse. What's wrong?\"\n\"Elara, I'm fine! Don't lie to me.\" Victoria shook her head, crying uncontrollably. \"You're bleeding so much. It must be very painful.\"\n\"Really, I'm fine.\" Elara forced a smile, sighed, and gently held her hand, \"Victoria, I know it's not really my place to say this, but since you don't have any family at home and I think of you as my own child, I'll say a few words. Don't take it to heart if I'm wrong.\"\n\"Elara...\" Victoria sniffled.\nElara continued, \"Although we haven't known each other for long, I understand your character and integrity. I believe you're not that kind of person, so there must be another reason for your relationship with Mr. Scott.\"",

        "content": "Elara stressed, \"Look, no matter how Mr. Scott and Ms. Garcia feel about each other, and no matter what promises Mr. Scott made to you, Ms. Garcia is his fiancée. If she comes over and yells at you, you just have to take it! You're young and naive, but you can't keep getting tangled up in this mess. It'll ruin you!\"\nVictoria felt a tightness in her chest as she listened to Elara's heartfelt words, making it hard to breathe.\nShe lowered her head and stayed quiet for a bit before slowly looking up. \"Elara, thanks for telling me this. I know you mean well. Don't worry, I know what to do.\"\nSeeing that Victoria had taken her advice to heart, Elara sighed in relief.\n\"Good, as long as you understand. I just hope you can get out of this situation soon and not get deeper into it.\"\nElara truly cared for Victoria, so when Ella and Willow showed up, she did her best to defend her!\n\"Elara, I'm really sorry.\" Victoria lowered her head, seeing the bruises on Elara's hand, and gently rested her forehead on it, crying in distress.\n\"I'm fine, really! Stop crying!\" Elara reached out and gently stroked Victoria's hair.\nAt that moment, the door opened, and a tall, thin young man walked in with some medicine.\nHe looked to be about twenty-seven, dressed in a black suit, looking very handsome and capable.\nSeeing Victoria, he just glanced at her briefly before looking away.\n\"Mom, I got your medicine. Take it first.\" Robert Davis handed the medicine to the bedside.\nElara's eyes reddened with grievance when Robert came in, but she stayed silent because Victoria was there.\nVictoria poured a cup of warm water and brought it over. \"Elara, take your medicine.\"\nElara nodded slightly.\nSeeing Elara take the medicine, Robert turned to Victoria and asked somewhat discontentedly, \"Are you Victoria? Is it because of you that my mom got hurt?\"\n\"Yes, I'm sorry,\" Victoria said softly, feeling extremely guilty.\nRobert snorted coldly, \"What's the point of saying that now? Please handle your personal life properly and don't drag others into it. Also, please find another place to live and move out of our house. I won't rent it to you anymore.\"\nHis words were very rude, and Victoria's face instantly turned red.\n\"Robert, what nonsense are you talking about!\" Elara called out to Robert, signaling him to stop talking.\nElara then turned to Victoria and said, \"Victoria, don't take it to heart. Robert just has a bad temper. You stay here and don't worry about him!\"\n\"No,\" Victoria shook her head and said. \"This is indeed my fault. I'm sorry.\"\nIf it weren't for her attachment to Elara, she would have agreed to move out.\nBut she couldn't bear to leave her.\n\"Just go already, and stop being a nuisance here,\" Robert said with a frown. \"My mom needs to rest!\"\n\"I can't leave...\" Victoria bit her lip, hesitated for a long time, and then said, \"Elara got hurt because of me. I want to stay and take care of her for the next couple of days.\"\n\"Suit yourself,\" Robert said impatiently. \"Just make sure you don't disturb my mom's rest.\"\nHe then turned to Elara and said, \"I've already called the police. They'll come by later to ask you a few questions. Just tell them the truth.\"\nElara glanced at Victoria and then waved her hand to Robert, saying, \"It's not a big deal. Why call the police? I'm fine. Tell them not to come.\"\nVictoria knew Elara didn't want to make things harder for her by blowing this up.\nIf it had been her getting hurt, Victoria would have endured it silently. But it was Elara lying there!\nShe couldn't let Elara suffer just to save her own reputation!\nBefore Robert could say anything, Victoria firmly said, \"If someone does something wrong, they have to pay the price. We must call the police!\"\nRobert was taken aback, clearly not expecting her to say that. His gaze toward her started to shift slightly.\nElara, of course, was unwilling, but no matter what she said, Victoria was determined.\nSeeing Victoria's resolute expression, Robert tentatively asked, \"Ms. Carter, have you thought this through? Going through the legal process can be very troublesome, and we might not get the result we want.\"\nVictoria shook her head, her eyes firm. \"I know it might be troublesome, but I can't just let it go. They can't bully Elara without facing any consequences,\" she responded.\nElara hurriedly said, \"Victoria, let it go. Don't make such a big deal out of it because of me. It's not a big deal; I'll be fine after some rest.\"\nVictoria held Elara's hand, gentle but firm. \"They must be held accountable for their actions. You can't just suffer in vain. Don't worry, I'll face this with you.\"\nRobert looked at Victoria, his impression of her slightly changing.\nHe looked at Elara and said, \"Mom, did you forget I'm a lawyer? I'll personally handle your case. What are you afraid of?\"\nHearing this, Elara remembered and said sheepishly, \"Look at me. I completely forgot about you. Robert, I'll rely on you then.\"\nRobert rolled his eyes helplessly. \"I got it. You rest well. I'll go prepare the documents.\"\nElara was about to nod when she suddenly remembered Victoria and immediately said, \"Victoria hasn't had dinner yet. Take her to get something to eat!\"\n\"Mom! I have work to do,\" Robert said, somewhat unwilling.\nVictoria noticed Robert's displeasure and quickly said, \"Elara, don't worry about me. I'm not hungry. You must be tired; I'll stay here with you.\"\n\"You need to eat. You need energy to take care of me!\" Elara felt a pang of distress seeing Victoria so thin and frail. She then turned to Robert and shouted, \"I told you to take her to get something to eat, so go! Are you ignoring me now?\"\nUnable to argue with her, Robert finally agreed to take Victoria out to get something to eat.\nAt a fast-food restaurant outside the hospital, they each ordered a simple plate of spaghetti.\nVictoria seemed to have little appetite, putting down her utensils after just a few bites.\nShe looked at Robert, hesitated for a moment, and then said, \"Mr. Davis, I'm really sorry about today.\"\nRobert glanced at Victoria, his tone cold. \"You don't need to apologize to me.\"\nHe paused for a moment and then added, \"There's nothing left to say between us.\"\nVictoria froze, lowering her eyes, not daring to meet Robert's gaze.\n\"Anything else? If not, I'm leaving,\" Robert said indifferently, preparing to leave.\n\"Wait,\" Victoria called out to him.\n\"Anything else?\" Robert turned and asked.\nVictoria bit her lip and said, \"Can't I move out? I promise nothing like this will happen again! I swear!\"\nSeeing Victoria's earnest expression, Robert found it amusing and sarcastically said, \"What do you have to promise? Your words?\"",

        "content": "Victoria clenched her jaw but couldn't come up with a comeback; she really had no guarantees.\n\"That's it. I'm super busy,\" Robert said, ready to turn and leave.\nJust then, his phone rang. He glanced at the number, frowned, and picked up.\nVictoria overheard him saying things like \"no way\" and \"see you in court.\"\nAfter hanging up, Robert looked at Victoria and said, \"The other side doesn't want to make a big deal out of this. Their lawyer called, asking for a settlement and compensation. What do you think?\"\nVictoria was quiet for a moment, then shook her head. \"No way! We're taking this all the way! They need to pay and be punished!\"\nRobert raised an eyebrow, looking at Victoria. \"You sure about that?\"\nVictoria nodded firmly.\nHer words made Robert's attitude soften a bit. At least she wasn't just after the money.\n\"Alright, I'll go back to the ward and tell my mom to be ready,\" Robert said, standing up and heading back.\nVictoria jogged to keep up with him.\nJust as they reached the ward door, it swung open, and Harry was about to leave.\nSeeing Victoria and Robert, he paused and looked back.\nFollowing his gaze, Victoria saw William behind him.\nHis face was dark and menacing, the hostility radiating off him was chilling.\nVictoria instinctively took a step back.\nRobert frowned. Even though he didn't like Victoria, he couldn't stand seeing a man bully a woman.\nSo he stepped forward slightly, blocking William's view, and coldly asked, \"Who are you?\"\nWilliam didn't even glance at Robert, staring straight at Victoria like he wanted to kill her.\nVictoria didn't want any more drama with him and instinctively hid behind Robert.\nHis presence was unexpected for Victoria.\nOf course, she didn't think he was there to sincerely visit Elara, but more likely to persuade Elara on behalf of Ella.\n\"Sir!\" Robert coldly looked at William and said, \"Who are you looking for? If you have no business here, please step aside. We need to go in!\"\nWilliam finally moved his gaze from Victoria, looked at Robert indifferently, and said, \"Mr. Davis? Can we talk?\"\n\"Sure,\" Robert replied. Then he turned to Victoria and said, \"You go in and talk to my mom. I'll be there soon.\"\nEven though he had always been hostile towards Victoria, at this moment, he seemed inexplicably trustworthy.\nVictoria responded softly and then pushed the door open and went inside.\nWilliam watched her obedient demeanor, which was a stark contrast to her arrogance when confronting him last night.\nRegardless, in this situation, William didn't want to argue with Victoria about yesterday's events.\nWilliam's eyes turned cold as he walked past them into the hallway. Soon, Robert followed.\nVictoria entered the ward and saw Elara waving at her. Elara looked at the door and whispered, \"Mr. Scott came to apologize.\"\nVictoria wasn't surprised and responded angrily, \"Is he apologizing and then asking for a settlement?\"\nElara smiled, gently pinching her cheek. She replied, \"A settlement isn't a big deal. I didn't want to make a big fuss.\"\n\"But...\" Victoria hesitated.\nSeeing this, Elara advised, \"Victoria, you're still young. Don't let these troubles affect you. Besides, Mr. Scott is right; the Garcia family is not to be trifled with. If this escalates, it might be bad for you. If we settle now, Mr. Scott can handle them. He also promised that if the Garcia family harms you again, he will personally deal with it.\"\nVictoria bit her lip, looking conflicted. \"I just can't accept it! I'd rather be the one lying here!\" she said.\nElara chuckled, knowing Victoria had a good heart, and whispered, \"He also promised to hand over their company's legal affairs to Robert and compensate me with a million dollars! With this compensation, Robert won't have to worry about supporting a wife!\"\nVictoria was amused by her, then sighed and said, \"Mr. Davis is so outstanding; you don't need to worry about him. You're doing this for me.\"\nElara patted her shoulder and said earnestly, \"Silly girl, I'm looking out for you, but I'm not losing out either, right? I believe in moderation. Don't push things too far, or you'll suffer.\"\nVictoria looked at her, feeling a pang of sadness.\nVictoria lowered her head and responded, \"Elara, I will help you get justice for your suffering!\"\nElara paused, then smiled and said, \"Alright.\"\nSoon, Robert came in.\nVictoria could guess the outcome: William had convinced Elara, and Robert was just being informed.\nEven if Robert was unwilling, he couldn't go against Elara's wishes as her son.\nAfter a few words with Elara and a glance at Victoria, he left.\nSeeing Elara looking tired, Victoria helped her lie down to rest.\nVictoria then took a book from her bag and started reading and taking notes by the bed. After over half an hour, she felt tired and saw that Elara was still sleeping.\nVictoria thought Elara might be hungry if she woke up in the middle of the night, so she went out to buy some pastries and fruit.\nAs soon as she stepped out of the hospital, she saw a black Maybach parked at the entrance.\nVictoria's expression changed, but she pretended not to notice.\nBut as the car window rolled down, her face stiffened.\nWilliam leaned back in his seat, looking serious and deep. His long legs were elegantly crossed, and he stared at her intently.\nHis gaze was oppressive, as if he wanted to devour Victoria.\nVictoria looked away, pretending not to notice him, and walked towards the supermarket.\n\"If you dare to leave, I guarantee you'll regret it.\" William's cold, deep voice came from behind, making Victoria stop abruptly.\nWilliam's words successfully halted Victoria.\nShe clenched her fingers, slowly turned around, met his cold eyes, and hoarsely said, \"Mr. Scott, I thought you came to apologize to Elara today.\"\nWhen he heard her hoarse voice, William's heart skipped a beat, as if he had forgotten something important.\nWilliam collected his thoughts, his expression softening slightly, and said, \"I've already apologized to Elara on behalf of Ella. I've also instructed Ella that this will never happen again.\"\nVictoria sneered, \"Should I thank you?\"\nHe frowned and replied, \"Do you have to be sarcastic?\"\n\"What else? Should I bow and thank you for your magnanimity?\" she smiled, her gaze firm. \"Ella sent people to humiliate me, then to force me to settle, sent people to beat my father in prison, and then locked me in a basement, almost costing me my life. You promised me justice! But today? Even my landlord was beaten into the hospital by them. Is this your guarantee? Just because the Scott family and the Garcia family have money and power, you can use and bully us without consequence?\" she retorted.\nWilliam pressed his lips together, his face gloomy.\nHe knew Victoria wasn't just talking about Elara's incident but also what happened yesterday.\nHe was indeed somewhat at fault.\nBut wasn't it all her own doing?\nThinking of this, he was about to speak.\nBut then, Victoria continued, \"William, forget about the two-month deadline. Starting today, let's not see each other anymore.\"",

Just because you're good in bed, you think I can't let you go?\"\nHis voice was low, but it still caught the attention of people passing by.\nWilliam finished, expecting Victoria to blow up.\nBut she stayed calm.\nShe looked at him, her gaze steady and cold. \"Of course, I know I'm nothing to you, Mr. Scott.\"\nHer calmness made William feel suffocated.\nShe went on, \"I've told you before, Ella loves you deeply, so she does foolish things. You're about to marry her, whether it's for love or some other reason, it has nothing to do with me. I don't want to get involved in your marriage. You promised me this wouldn't happen again, but you didn't keep your word. You won't do anything to her because of me or anyone else who means nothing to you. Please, for the sake of me being a pawn in your game yesterday, let me go, okay?\"\nWilliam sneered, \"Are you saying this because you've found someone new?\"\nHis words stung, but Victoria was used to his disdain, especially after he'd been drinking. She wasn't fazed by his insults anymore.\n\"Yes,\" she said bluntly.\nWilliam's eyes narrowed, burning with anger as he glared at her.\nVictoria was startled by the intensity of his gaze, but she stood her ground, looking at him without fear.\n\"Is it Joshua? Or Robert today? You're pretty good at seducing men!\" William mocked.\nVictoria didn't get angry. Instead, she smiled faintly. \"William, say whatever you want if it makes you feel better. Just leave me alone.\"\n\"Is that how you ask for a favor?\" William raised an eyebrow.\n\"Do you want me to beg?\" she asked.\nWilliam didn't answer.\nVictoria bit her lip, looked up, and met his gaze. \"Fine! If that's what it takes, I'll beg! William, I'm begging you, please stay out of my life!\" With that, Victoria actually knelt in front of William.\nThe November chill in Silvermist City was particularly biting this year, yet Victoria wore only thin clothes. Her knees hit the hard concrete, sending a jolt of pain through her body.\nBut she didn't care!\nAs long as she could get away from him, she'd do anything.\n\"Victoria!\" William didn't expect her to kneel, his face turning pale.\n\"What are you doing?\" he roared, reaching out to pull Victoria up, but she dodged.\n\"Please!\" Victoria said, looking at him calmly. \"Be merciful and let me go!\"\nHearing this, William clenched his fists, the veins on his arms bulging.\nHe opened his hands, a sneer on his lips. \"If that's what you want, fine. Be that way.\" With that, he turned and walked away.\nWhen he disappeared around the corner, Victoria finally couldn't hold on any longer and collapsed, exhausted.\nWas she eventually free from him?\nVictoria closed her eyes, feeling a wave of bitterness. Her actions must have really pissed him off. But that was good. Finally, she was free.\nTo take care of Elara, Victoria asked Diana for a few days off and arranged to work online.\nLuckily, with the internet being so advanced, businesses weren't just about offline sales anymore.\nEven though she couldn't go to Starry Studio Gallery, she could still get her work done online.\nElara noticed how pale and tired Victoria looked from taking care of her and couldn't help but say, \"Victoria, I'm fine now. I just need a couple more days to recover. Look at you-you've been so exhausted taking care of me!\"\nVictoria smiled and shook her head. \"Elara, are you trying to get rid of me?\" she teased.\n\"Of course not...\" Elara quickly replied. \"I'm just worried. Taking care of me and working... How will you manage?\"\nVictoria smiled and said, \"It's okay, Elara.\"\nElara sighed, knowing she couldn't change Victoria's mind, so she let it go.\nDuring this time, Robert came to the hospital to see Elara almost every day.\nBy the time he arrived, Elara had taken her medicine and fallen asleep. Victoria was working at a small table nearby.\nHearing footsteps, Victoria looked up.\nShe gave Robert a polite smile when she saw him. He nodded back.\nHis eyes fell on the corner, where copies of the \"Construction Quality Management Regulations\" and the \"Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\" were displayed. He asked, \"Are you still studying this?\"\n\"Yes,\" Victoria nodded. \"I want to learn more about my dad's case.\"\n\"Your dad?\" Robert was surprised.\nVictoria explained, \"Yes. My dad was sentenced to ten years for a design issue, and I want to see if I can help him.\"\nRobert frowned, thinking for a moment before recalling the nationally sensational stadium collapse case and the bridge collapse case ten years ago.\nHe realized the person involved was also named Alvin Carter. This, then, was Victoria's father.\nVictoria noticed Robert's thoughtful expression and lowered her eyes.\n\"Do you suspect something?\" As a lawyer, Robert knew the law wasn't always perfect.\nEspecially when powerful people stirred things up behind the scenes for their own interests.\n\"My dad was always serious and responsible about his work. I never believed he would make such a low-level mistake.\" Victoria bit her lip, her eyes slightly red.\nSeeing this, Robert hesitated and asked, \"Didn't your dad have a lawyer to defend him at the time?\"\nHearing this, Victoria was stunned.\nShe was studying abroad at the time, and by the time she returned, Alvin had already been convicted.\nShe had never seen his lawyer.\nSeeing this, Robert suggested, \"If you really want to investigate your dad's case, you should first ask his lawyer. No one knows the ins and outs of the case better than him.\"\nVictoria's eyes lit up. \"Thank you,\" she said, offering him a sincere bow. \"I know what to do now.\"\nRobert quickly stopped her and said, \"Not at all. I just saw how hard you were working to take care of Elara and gave a casual reminder.\"\nVictoria smiled and said, \"No matter what, I still have to thank you.\"\nAs they were talking, Elara woke up, and they ended their conversation.\nElara stayed in the hospital for five days before she could finally be discharged.\nAfter helping Robert take Elara home, Victoria returned to her normal work routine.\nWithout William's interference, Victoria worked hard during the day and focused on painting her competition piece at night.\nA week later, she finally finished the initial draft of \"The Wounded White Deer.\"\nOn Saturday, feeling both nervous and excited, Victoria carefully brought the painting to Samuel's studio.",

        "content": "The studio had that familiar mix of paint and turpentine in the air, with sunlight pouring through the big windows, casting warm spots on the floor.\nSamuel carefully set the painting on the easel and took a few steps back, quietly studying it.\nVictoria stood off to the side, nervously fidgeting with her hands, waiting for his feedback.\nSamuel looked more serious than ever.\nHis profile was striking, with a high nose bridge and sharp, focused eyes.\nAfter what felt like forever, he finally turned to look at Victoria.\nVictoria nervously licked her lips, holding her breath, waiting for his thoughts.\n\"Not bad.\" He broke the silence, noticing her hands shaking with anxiety, and finally smiled, giving a simple nod of approval.\nVictoria's eyes widened in surprise.\n\"Really?\" she asked, her face lighting up.\n\"Really,\" Samuel said, a smile tugging at his lips. \"It's definitely good enough for the competition, though there's always room for improvement.\"\nVictoria let out a huge sigh of relief, collapsing into a chair like a deflated balloon.\nSamuel chuckled at her reaction and continued, \"You've captured the white deer beautifully. The hurt and confusion in its eyes are really striking.\"\nHe walked up to the painting, pointing out details on the white deer. \"The texture of the feathers here and the layering of the forest in the background are really well done.\"\nHearing Samuel's praise, Victoria felt a rush of joy, but she knew there was still a lot to learn.\nShe stepped closer to her work and asked, \"Professor Brown, what do you think I should work on?\"\nSamuel thought for a moment, then said, \"From a composition standpoint, you could adjust the position and size of the white deer to make it stand out more. Also, enhancing the color contrast would make the painting more impactful.\"\nVictoria listened carefully, marking the changes with a pencil on the paper.\nSamuel stood beside her, offering tips now and then. When Victoria misunderstood something, he gently corrected her, his hand briefly covering hers.\nVictoria's heart raced as she felt his long fingers around her hand.\nThey were so close their breaths mingled.\nVictoria suddenly felt a strange sensation and instinctively pulled back.\nBut Samuel's grip tightened, his gaze intense as if he wanted to melt her defenses.\nVictoria awkwardly tugged at the corners of her mouth and tentatively asked, \"Professor Brown, you...\"\n\"Call me Samuel,\" he said hoarsely, \"That title is too formal.\"\nVictoria's cheeks turned red at his words, and she stammered, \"Samuel.\"\nSamuel looked at her gently, smiling. \"Good girl.\"\nThey had spent a lot of time together, but never like this. Victoria's heart was pounding, and she didn't dare get too close to Samuel, afraid she'd lose her cool.\n\"I-I'll go get the drawing board,\" Victoria said quickly, then hurried to her desk.\nSamuel watched her retreat, unable to hide his smile.\nAfter going over some more details, it was time for lunch, and Victoria offered to treat.\nVictoria was just about to call him Professor Brown, then quickly corrected herself, \"Samuel, I just got paid. Let me treat you to a meal.\"\nSamuel had helped her so much, and she hadn't had a chance to thank him properly.\nShe had just been promoted at Starry Studio Gallery, and her performance this month was good, earning her a couple of thousand dollars.\nAlthough it was nothing compared to Samuel's income, it was a token of her appreciation.\nHearing this, Samuel readily agreed, \"Sure, I won't refuse.\"\nVictoria smiled and said, \"I know a nearby restaurant that's pretty good. Let's go try it!\"\n\"Okay.\" Samuel nodded.\nAfter tidying up, they left.\nSamuel found a parking spot, and they took the elevator to the top floor.\nThe restaurant manager saw Victoria and warmly greeted her, \"Ms. Carter, it's been a while. What brings you here today?\"\nVictoria used to be a regular at this restaurant, often coming here for their Escargot, which Alvin frequently brought her to enjoy.\nShe was beautiful and polite, so the manager naturally remembered her.\n\"I'm here for lunch with a friend,\" Victoria said with a smile.\nThe manager nodded with a smile and led them into the restaurant.\nThe restaurant was simply and cleanly decorated, with several famous paintings on the walls.\nSamuel glanced around, his gaze finally settling on a table by the window.\n\"Ms. Carter, this way please,\" the manager said, leading them to the window seat.\nSamuel pulled out a chair for Victoria with a gentlemanly gesture. She thanked him before taking her seat.\nThe waiter brought the menu, and Victoria handed it to Samuel. \"Samuel, order whatever you like. Don't be formal.\"\nSamuel smiled and replied, \"Alright, I won't hold back then.\"\nHe then ordered a few signature dishes, including the Escargot that Victoria had mentioned.\nWhen the dishes were served, Victoria raised her juice glass and smiled at Samuel. \"Samuel, thank you...\"\nBefore she could finish, Samuel placed his hand on her glass and shook his head. \"If you keep thanking me like this, I'll get angry.\" His tone was so serious that Victoria was momentarily stunned.\nA weary sigh escaped Samuel's lips as he watched her. \"Victoria,\" he said, the helplessness evident in his voice, \"you know my feelings. Why do you insist on keeping your distance?\"\nHis words struck a chord deep within Victoria, and she lowered her eyelashes to hide the turmoil in her heart.\nShe said, \"I'm sorry.\"\nDisappointment flashed in Samuel's eyes, but he forced a smile and said lightly, \"There's no need for apologies between us.\"\nWith that, he placed Victoria's favorite Escargot on her plate.\nVictoria looked down at the glistening Escargot, her nose tingling with emotion. She tried to suppress her feelings and looked up at Samuel with a bright smile.\nA gentle smile touched Samuel's lips, and his eyes softened with warmth.\nHe thought, 'She's still young and shy, no rush!'\nNoticing some sauce on the corner of Victoria's mouth, Samuel gently took a few napkins and wiped it away.\nHis actions were natural and smooth, without any awkwardness.\nThis tender moment was all witnessed by William, who had just walked in.",

His face was stern, and he had a frosty vibe.\nHe gave off a gloomy, intimidating aura.\nSince the day she begged him for mercy, Victoria hadn't seen William for over two weeks.\nHer palms clenched involuntarily, her heart pounding at his sudden appearance.\nSamuel noticed Victoria's stiffness and looked up to see William.\nHe caught Victoria's reaction, his brow furrowing slightly. His gaze flickered to William before he casually looked away, shifting in his seat just enough to break William's intense stare.\nHis casual demeanor hid a sharp edge.\nSeeing Samuel's protective stance, William felt a surge of anger.\nHe strode past their table and sat down at a seat in front.\nHowever, Samuel ignored William, turned to Victoria, and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\nHearing this, Victoria quickly gathered her thoughts and forced a faint smile. \"Nothing.\"\nSamuel smiled, put on disposable gloves, and began peeling shrimp for her.\nHis fingers were long and slender, with distinct bones and smooth, rounded nails. His actions were skillful and elegant.\nVictoria stared blankly at his movements, unsure of what expression to make.\nSamuel then finished peeling the shrimp and placed it on Victoria's plate.\nSeeing this, Victoria felt a bit overwhelmed and said self-deprecatingly, \"It's okay. I can do it myself. Since I was a child, only my dad has peeled shrimp for me. At home, I always peeled shrimp for my mom and brother.\"\n\"From now on, I'll take over the job of peeling shrimp for you,\" Samuel joked, his gaze soft and warm, like the gentle sunlight of spring.\nVictoria was amused by him and couldn't help but laugh.\nThe two chatted and laughed, creating a very pleasant atmosphere.\nMeanwhile, William's gaze remained on them, deep and chilling.\nVictoria looked much better now. She used to be pale and haggard, but now her face was rosy, and she smiled brightly at Samuel across from her.\nSamuel looked several years older than her. Time had given him a calm and restrained charm, elegant manners, and an excellent upbringing, clearly indicating a distinguished background.\nThe more William thought about it, the more his inner fire burned.\nWas Victoria so happy after leaving him?\nDid she find a man much older than her? Was she blind?\nA menacing aura radiated from William as his eyes narrowed dangerously, reducing Harry to a trembling, breathless mess beside him.\nWilliam had been in a bad mood lately, and now he had encountered a trigger.\nHarry silently prayed that he wouldn't get involved, or he would be in big trouble!\n\"Mr. Scott, how about we go to another place?\" he asked bravely.\n\"No need,\" William replied slowly, then stood up and walked straight to Samuel's table.\nVictoria's face blanched in an instant as she saw him approach.\nSamuel looked up, noticing William walking towards them, but maintained a gentle and humble smile. \"Sir, can I help you?\" he asked.\nYet William didn't even glance at Samuel, staring directly at Victoria.\nVictoria was so scared that she could hardly breathe. She gritted her teeth and glared at him, her eyes full of warning.\nWilliam casually placed a hand on the back of her chair, leaned in slightly, and whispered near her ear, \"What a coincidence, Ms. Carter!\"\nHe dragged out the last part of her name, making it sound like a threat.\nVictoria clenched her fists and took a deep breath, trying to stay calm.\nThey were no longer involved. What was there to be afraid of?\nWith that thought, Victoria regained her composure and responded calmly, \"Yes, quite a coincidence, Mr. Scott.\"\nWilliam sneered, his gaze shifting to Samuel. \"Ms. Carter, aren't you going to introduce your new friend?\" He emphasized the word 'friend.'\nVictoria was about to refuse when Samuel's deep, magnetic voice cut in.\nSamuel nodded slightly, extended his right hand to William, and said politely, \"Samuel Brown, Victoria's male friend.\"\nWilliam's eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze locking with Samuel's before he slowly extended his hand.\n\"Hello. William Scott, Victoria's former boss,\" William responded.\nAs their hands clasped, the atmosphere grew tense.\nThough William tightened his grip, Samuel met the pressure with a calm, unwavering smile.\nBut to William, that smile was infuriating!\nHe increased the pressure, trying to crush Samuel's hand.\nHowever, Samuel maintained his composure, his smile never wavering, appearing refined and courteous.\nVictoria watched their confrontation nervously but had no reason to intervene.\nTheir handshake lasted for a while, until both their palms were sweaty, before they finally let go.\nWilliam then withdrew his hand, put it in his pocket, and looked down at Samuel, his tone icy. \"Mr. Brown, quite impressive!\"\nSamuel smiled warmly and said, \"Likewise.\"\nWilliam sneered, gave Victoria a deep look, then turned and walked out.\nHarry quickly followed, anxiously saying, \"Mr. Scott, wait for me.\"\nAfter William left, Samuel turned his attention back to Victoria. \"Are you okay?\" he asked.\nVictoria nodded, still anxious, and said worriedly, \"I'm sorry for causing you this trouble.\"\nSamuel shrugged indifferently and said, \"Just a kid who hasn't grown up. Don't worry, I don't take him seriously.\"\nNot even understanding his own feelings, what else could William be but a child?\nHe acted like a schoolboy who bullied the girl he liked.\nBut it was just as well; it gave Samuel an opportunity.\nAfter William left, Victoria lost her appetite and couldn't muster any interest. She only drank two glasses of juice to fill her stomach.\nNoticing her in a bad state, Samuel considerately stood up and said, \"Victoria, let me take you home.\"\nVictoria nodded.\nThey got into Samuel's car in the parking garage, and Samuel pulled the seatbelt over to buckle it for Victoria.\nHis actions were natural, his demeanor easy, not feeling anything inappropriate.\nWhen his fingers lightly touched Victoria's skin, she instinctively shrank her neck.\nVictoria awkwardly laughed and said, \"Thank you.\"\n\"Do we have to be so formal with each other?\" Samuel asked.\nHis deep, rich voice, filled with a charming huskiness, made Victoria's cheeks flush.\nShe lowered her eyes, avoiding Samuel's gaze, a reaction he didn't miss.\nVictoria's ears were red, like a ripe cherry, particularly enticing.\nSamuel suddenly felt his throat dry. He swallowed as heat surged within him, urgently needing to be quenched.\nHe couldn't help but lean closer to Victoria, his hot breath brushing against her face.",

He leaned in closer, his warm breath tickling her face.\nVictoria instinctively tried to back away, but Samuel moved even closer, pinning her against the car window with nowhere to go.\n\"Samuel, what are you doing?\" Victoria's voice wavered, and she felt the mix of tobacco and his body wash scent surrounding her.\nHis presence was overwhelming, and she felt like she was drowning in a sea of fire.\nSamuel didn't say a word, just placed a gentle kiss on her forehead.\nVictoria was stunned, her mind going blank.\nIt wasn't until Samuel pulled back that she snapped out of it.\n\"Samuel, you!\" Victoria was at a loss for words.\nSamuel gave a small smile and said softly, \"Don't worry; I'm not going to rush you. Take your time. I've got plenty of patience.\"\nVictoria hesitated for a moment before nodding, her cheeks turning pink.\nSamuel then settled back in his seat, started the car, and headed towards Victoria's place.\nHe dropped her off at her apartment entrance.\nVictoria got out of the car and turned to thank him.\nSamuel grabbed a box of nutritional supplements from the trunk and handed it to her. \"I've noticed you haven't been sleeping well, so I got these sleep aids for you. Make sure to use them.\"\nVictoria was touched by his thoughtfulness. She pressed her lips together, took the box, and thanked him sincerely.\nJust as she was about to leave, Samuel called out to her again.\n\"Oh, by the way, my parents are coming back soon. They heard their bachelor son finally has a love life and want to invite you to dinner. Would you be up for it?\"\nVictoria was caught off guard and was about to refuse, but Samuel quickly added, \"No pressure. It's just that I've never had a girlfriend, and they keep questioning if there's something wrong with me.\"\nHe rubbed his temples in frustration.\nVictoria couldn't help but laugh. After a moment, she nodded and agreed, \"Alright.\"\nSamuel smiled, a glint of satisfaction in his eyes.\nThey set a time to meet, and Samuel drove off.\nAs soon as Victoria walked through her door, her phone rang. It was Nora.\nAfter a moment of hesitation, she answered.\nNora's cold, mocking voice came through, \"Victoria, living the high life now and forgetting about me?\"\nVictoria frowned, her tone icy. \"If you're calling to give me grief, I'm hanging up.\"\n\"Don't you dare!\" Nora snapped, \"I'm your mother! Have you no conscience?\"\nVictoria sneered, \"Conscience? Mom, do you remember what you and Bobby have done recently?\" Her voice cracked.\nNora was silent for a moment before recovering.\n\"Those were just minor things. Why are you being so petty? We're family.\"\n\"Locking me in the basement,\" Victoria said, her voice dangerously low, \"almost killing me and subjecting me to online harassment. You call those minor things?\"\nNora was speechless.\nVictoria took a deep breath, trying to keep her anger and sadness in check. \"What do you want from me today?\"\nVictoria had lost all hope and just wanted to know what Nora had to say.\nNora hesitated for a moment before slowly saying, \"The hospital is demanding payment.\"\nVictoria knew that Nora only ever contacted her for money, but she still held onto a tiny sliver of hope.\nUnfortunately, Nora was still the same.\nThinking of this, Victoria hung up the phone.\nNora, hearing the busy tone, angrily threw her phone on the ground, shattering the screen.\nVictoria actually hung up on her!\nFuming, Nora cursed, \"Ungrateful brat, even a dog would be more grateful than you.\"\nA nurse entering the room heard Nora's sharp curses, knowing instantly they were directed at Victoria.\nThey said women could empathize with women.\nBut Nora, as a mother, was beyond heartless and unfair.\nShe had been staying in a high-end VIP hospital room for months, all paid for by Victoria.\nYet every time Victoria visited, she never received a kind word.\nBut Nora was always attentive and caring towards Bobby, who constantly asked her for money.\nVictoria had been hospitalized several times, and Nora acted as if nothing had happened, completely indifferent.\nThe nurse thought that if it were her, she would have gone mad long ago.\nA mother like that?\nThough the nurse was silently cursing, she still picked up the phone and placed it on the bedside table.\n\"Ms. Adams, are you alright?\" she asked.\nNora glared at her and snapped, \"Why so much nonsense! Give me my medicine!\"\nThe nurse rolled her eyes, handed Nora the medicine bottle, and reminded her, \"Ms. Adams, the medical fees your daughter paid for you have all been used up. If you don't pay the remaining fees in the next few days, we'll have to discharge you.\"\nHearing this, Nora immediately got angry.\nShe retorted, \"What do you mean? Are you saying I can't afford to pay?\"\nHowever, the nurse shrugged and said nothing.\nNora, furious, pointed at the nurse and yelled, \"Get out now!\"\nThe nurse, uninterested in arguing, left the room.\nThe room fell silent, and Nora, clutching the medicine bottle, was seething with anger.\nShe had no choice but to call Victoria again.\nAt that time, Victoria was focused on revising her competition entry. When she finally checked her phone, she saw that Nora had called numerous times.\nShe rubbed her temples and redialed. \"Victoria, are you crazy?!\" Nora's voice exploded through the phone. \"Why didn't you answer my calls?\"\nVictoria replied, \"I have no money. I can't help you.\"\n\"How dare you speak to me like that?\" Nora shouted, \"I'm being mistreated here. The nurses look at me like I'm a plague, afraid I'll stick around! Victoria, can you really bear to see me kicked out of the hospital and die?\"\n\"I told you, I have no money. Don't you understand?\" Victoria was also angry.\nShe had tolerated Nora enough, but Nora kept pushing, thinking she was easy to bully.\nHearing this, Nora was momentarily speechless, but she didn't believe Victoria.\nAfter all, Victoria's sugar daddy was William from the Scott family, a billionaire family.\nHow could she have no money?\nShe was just angry and didn't want to help.\nBut Nora knew Victoria was decisive and strong-willed, not afraid of confrontation.\nNora took a deep breath, trying to calm her anger, and gently persuaded, \"Victoria, even if you're mad at me, you can't ignore your father. The house has been auctioned off. If he knew I was kicked out of the hospital and homeless, how heartbroken would he be?\"\nVictoria laughed coldly, mocking, \"The luxury apartment Bobby lives in was secretly bought by you in his name, right? Why don't you move in with him?\"\nNora's heart skipped a beat at Victoria's words.",

When she found out that Alvin was in trouble, she quietly sold her jewelry and exchanged it for gold bars.\nAfter the fuss had died down, she used the money to buy an apartment in the center of Silvermist City, making it convenient for Bobby to attend school.\nShe thought she had been very discreet. Even when she was hospitalized and had no money, she didn't use it. Who knew that Victoria found out?\nNora felt extremely guilty.\nShe stammered in rebuttal, \"What nonsense are you talking about? How could I have such skills!\"\nVictoria sneered, she had guessed that Nora wouldn't want to admit it.\nVictoria didn't say anything, and Nora pitifully said, \"Victoria, are you really going to ignore me?\"\nA trace of mockery flashed in Victoria's eyes.\nThis is Nora, always taking and never giving!\nNora said many nice things, but Victoria remained unmoved. She had long lost her patience with Nora's act and was well aware of her cold-hearted nature.\nShe decided to break off with her, \"Mom, you took that one million dollars from me when you tricked me into signing the settlement agreement with Ella without any guilt. Bobby betrayed me and helped Ella cyberbully me, he must have received a lot of money too, right? Now you come to me for money; do you think it's appropriate?

But since you are so ungrateful, don't blame me for being ruthless. \n\"I'll give you three days. If you don't pay the remaining medical bills, I'll expose your sexual relationship agreement with William online, let everyone see how disgraceful Joshua's student is. By then, not only will you be ruined, but your teacher's reputation will be destroyed.\"\nAfter saying this, Nora couldn't wait to hang up the phone, afraid that Victoria would continue to pester her.\nVictoria stared at the phone screen, her eyes filled with anger.\nShe gripped the phone tightly, trembling all over, and slowly slid down to the floor by the window.\nHer eyes reddened, and tears kept falling down her cheeks.\nShe looked up at the window.\nAt this moment, the sky was overcast, dark clouds covered the entire city.\nThe rain became more violent, with large raindrops hitting the window glass.\nShe sat there in a daze, letting the rain soak her clothes.\nAfter a long time, she finally cried out, \"I am also your child, why have you never considered me! Why do you treat me like this!\"\nAfter hanging up the phone, Nora let out a long sigh.\nShe actually didn't want to break off with Victoria, after all, since Alvin went to prison, it had always been Victoria who supported her.\nOffending her wouldn't end well for herself either.\nBut since Victoria was so unyielding, she had no choice but to use extreme measures.\nHowever, she didn't really want to completely break off with Victoria.\nIf Victoria was determined not to pay this time, she couldn't really expose her, that would be like shooting herself in the foot.\nNora bit her lip, then dialed another number.\nAlthough she didn't want to be threatened by Nora, Victoria was very afraid that she would really expose her scandal online.\nShe would do anything for money!\nIf only she was exposed, it wouldn't matter much, after all, she had long been considered lowly.\nBut now she was seen as Joshua's student, if her relationship with William was exposed, Joshua's reputation would also be damaged!\nThis was something Victoria absolutely couldn't allow to happen!\nAfter thinking all night, Victoria decided to go to the hospital and pay Nora's bill.\nSeeing her haggard face, the nurse who had been scolded by Nora quickly pulled her aside and whispered, \"You're here to pay your mom's bill, right? No need, it's already paid.\"\nVictoria was stunned, \"How is that possible? Did she pay it herself?\"\nDid she have a change of heart and decide to spend her own money?\nThe nurse rolled her eyes, \"Of course not, it was someone else.\"\nVictoria was even more puzzled, \"Who?\"\nThe nurse sighed dramatically, \"It was Mr. Scott!\"\n\"William?\"\nThe nurse nodded affirmatively, \"Yes, who else but Mr. Scott could afford to pay a year's hospital bill in one go; it's nearly a million dollars!\"\nAfter saying this, she gave Victoria a jealous look and walked away muttering.\nListening to the nurse's complaints, Victoria stood frozen in place.\nIt really was William.\nShe stormed over and pushed open Nora's hospital room door.\nNora was leisurely lying on the bed looking at her phone.\nSeeing Victoria come in, she was startled, quickly locked her phone, and turned to Victoria, frowning, \"You still know to come?\"\nVictoria ignored Nora and questioned, \"Do you have any shame, letting William pay your hospital bill?\"\nHearing this, Nora immediately got angry.\nShe quickly stood up, pointed at Victoria, and shouted, \"If you had paid it, would I have had to lower my dignity to ask him?\"\nVictoria sneered, \"So it's all my fault?\"\nNora choked, \"If it's not your fault, is it mine? If you had been filial, would I have had to beg William?\"\nShe spoke so righteously, as if it was really Victoria's fault.\nVictoria was so angry at her shameless words that she trembled all over.\nNora, as if not seeing this, continued, \"Besides, you've been sleeping with him for so long, if this were ancient times, you'd be his concubine. I'm practically his mother-in-law, isn't it only right for him to pay for his mother-in-law?\"\nVictoria, enraged, stepped forward and swept the kettle and cups off the table, smashing them to pieces.\nThe loud noise startled Nora, leaving her stunned.\nWhen she came to her senses, she glared at Victoria and raised her hand to slap her, \"How dare you act out in front of me!\"\n\"Stop!\"\nJust as Nora's hand was about to touch Victoria's face, a deep, cold male voice reached their ears.",

Where are you going?\" William frowned and called out to her.\nVictoria stopped and looked back at him.\nShe said coldly, \"It's none of your business, Mr. Scott. I'll go wherever I want.\"\nWith that, she quickly left the ward without looking back.\nWatching her leave, William was furious.\nVictoria was truly ungrateful.\nNora saw William's increasingly ugly expression and said mockingly, \"My daughter is just cheap, easily getting carried away. If you're nice to her, she not only doesn't appreciate it but becomes even more arrogant. Don't spoil her too much, or she won't know her place.\"\nWilliam said nothing, turned to glance at Nora, his eyes extremely indifferent. \"I like spoiling her. It's none of your business.\"\nWith that, William pushed the door open and left.\nNora stood there, gritting her teeth in anger.\nVictoria didn't leave, standing at the hospital entrance waiting for William.\nAfter about three minutes, a Rolls-Royce Phantom drove steadily up and stopped beside her.\nThe window rolled down, revealing William's handsome face.\n\"Get in.\"\nVictoria didn't hesitate, opened the door, and got in.\nThe Rolls-Royce drove through the streets, where neon lights flashed constantly.\nVictoria looked at the changing street scenes, her voice hoarse. \"William, you should know how deep the grudge between my mom and me is. I won't have anything to do with you because of her, so please don't interfere in my family's affairs anymore.\"\nAs she spoke, Victoria suddenly stopped, turned her head, and looked at William with determination.\nWilliam found her pretense of calmness amusing.\nShe seemed like a little kitten trying to act like a big tiger, both harmless and rather adorable.\nConsidering her completely indifferent mother, Nora, he understood why she had to put up defenses to protect herself.\nIt was hard to tell whether to sympathize or pity her.\nNot hearing William's response, Victoria couldn't help but raise her eyebrows and asked again. \"Will you agree or not?\"\nWilliam collected his thoughts, turned his head, and stared at her seriously. \"Victoria, you think too highly of yourself. If it weren't for your father...\"\nHe suddenly stopped talking.\nVictoria couldn't understand how it related to Alvin.\nCould it be that William not only knew about Alvin from the news but also had some private dealings with him?\nThinking of this possibility, she became wary, her breathing gradually becoming rapid.\nShe clenched her fists, trying to maintain a calm expression, and tentatively asked, \"What about my father?\"\nWilliam didn't want Victoria to know about his grudge with Alvin, so he casually said. \"If it weren't for your father causing so many deaths, I wouldn't hate the Carter family so much. Who knew you would satisfy me in bed, unlike any other woman...\"\nBefore he could finish, Victoria's chest heaved with anger, and she gritted her teeth. \"You bastard!\"\nWilliam ignored her curse and continued, \"Your mom threatened me on the phone, saying if I didn't pay her medical bills, she would expose our relationship online. I don't care, every rich kid has some scandals, right? But you, if this news gets out, can you still work at the gallery? I did you a big favor, and you curse me instead of thanking me. Is that how you treat your benefactor?\"\nHe spoke lightly, but Victoria was furious.\nHe was blatantly threatening her, forcing her to submit!\n\"You should know, your mom is staying in the most luxurious hospital room, using the best medicine and living supplies, plus various nutritional and skincare products...\"\nVictoria knew William wasn't exaggerating.\nNora had lived in luxury since childhood, and even after marrying Alvin, she used the best of everything.\nEven after Alvin went to prison, Nora was protected well, never suffering from the Carter family's bankruptcy.\nSeeing Victoria's face darken, William continued. \"I'm a businessman, spending so much money, do you think it's for charity? And I've paid off the debts your dad left behind. I can let the principal slide for now, but you should at least cover the interest each month-it's no small sum.\"\nVictoria gritted her teeth. \"I'll pay the interest myself every month!\"\nWilliam sneered, \"I've been paying the interest for you, you might not know. Over a hundred thousand dollars a month. How much did you earn this month? Two thousand dollars? How will you pay? Find another sugar daddy?\"\nVictoria's eyes reddened.\nSeeing his goal was almost achieved, William smiled in satisfaction.\nHe turned his head, glanced at her casually, and reminded, \"Of course, you can choose not to pay. But your father's sentence will...\"\n\"Enough!\" Victoria growled, her eyes red.\nWilliam stopped, and said indifferently, \"Don't think about Samuel or Joshua, stay with me, and I won't treat you badly.\"\nVictoria clenched her fists, her eyes filled with tears, glaring at William.\nSeeing her pitiful yet pretending to be strong, William's long-suppressed desire stirred again.\nHe instructed Harry, the driver, \"Drive to the riverside.\"\nHarry was slightly stunned, then respectfully responded, \"Yes.\"\nVictoria's eyes widened in shock.\n\"What are you doing?\" she exclaimed.\n\"You'll know soon.\" William smiled wickedly.\nVictoria's heart raced, she looked ahead in panic, and when the car slowed down, she even thought of opening the door to escape.\nWilliam reached out and pulled her back.\nVictoria was forced into his arms, his unique male scent filled her nose, making her shiver.\nShe struggled desperately, but William didn't let go.\nHarry parked the car on a deserted riverside path, turned off the engine, and got out.\nThe car's interior was narrow and cramped; his warm breaths sprayed on her neck, sending shivers down her spine.",

So, what should I do?\"\nVictoria shook her head to refuse his touch, her eyes filled with glistening tears.\nWilliam squinted his eyes and leaned close to her ear, lightly licking her sensitive earlobe, his hoarse voice full of magnetism, \"We've done it so many times already, why do you still pretend to be so pure?\"\nHis tone was ambiguous, filled with intense desire.\nVictoria only felt her ears itch, her whole body becoming even more rigid.\n\"Let go of me! Let go of me!\" Victoria twisted her body, pushing William in front of her with all her might.\nWilliam pressed her down, mercilessly blocking her mouth, wantonly biting her lips.\nHis kissing skills were skilled and domineering, with an aggressiveness that Victoria couldn't resist, causing her to moan involuntarily.\nThe more she struggled, the more William intensified his actions. Her arms felt like they were tightly bound by iron, unable to break free from him.\nVictoria's legs had long lost their strength, slumping against the seatback, allowing William to suck her lips.\nWilliam pressed her down on the seat, his large hand wandering and caressing her slender waist, touching her curvaceous body through the thin fabric.\n\"Indeed, your body suits my taste better.\"\nWilliam murmured in a low voice, lowering his head to kiss her soft collarbone, following her curves downwards, finally landing on her chest.\nVictoria struggled to push his shoulders, \"Get off me, don't touch me!\"\nAs soon as Victoria spoke, William's thumb pressed against her lips, stopping her from continuing.\nHis tongue licked the skin on her chest, the tingling sensation spreading throughout her body, making Victoria involuntarily arch her body and softly moan.\nHe chuckled, his fingers threading through her long hair, easily pressing her against the seatback, while his other hand slid to her buttocks, kneading them twice, teasingly saying, \"Baby, your butt is really perky.\"\nVictoria felt hot all over, even her ears turning red.\nShe was both ashamed and angry, her cheeks flushed red, and she stomped hard on William's foot, shouting angrily, \"Bastard!\"\nHer voice was charming and seductive, combined with her current embarrassed and angry expression, it was truly captivating.\nA strange light flashed in William's eyes, and he chuckled, \"Is this what you call a bastard?\"\nWith that, he unzipped his pants, revealing his hideous and ugly penis.\nHe lifted Victoria onto the back seat of the car, pressing down on her, and tore off her panties.\nVictoria shamefully closed her eyes, feeling utterly hopeless.\nWilliam stared at her flushed, moist eyes, a gleam flashing in his eyes. He held her waist with one hand, half-lifting her up.\n\"Don't do this!\" Victoria screamed.\nWilliam sneered, \"Don't do this? You've done this plenty of times before.\"\nBefore he finished speaking, he thrust into Victoria's body, pounding vigorously.\nVictoria cried out in pain.\n\"Relax a bit, baby, you're squeezing me so tight I might release right away,\" William panted.\n\"William, get off me!\" Victoria bit her lower lip hard, her hands pounding on William's shoulders and back.\nWilliam ignored her, continuing his frenzied thrusts.\n\"Don't you like this?\"\nAs he asked, his fingers deftly unhooked Victoria's bra, grabbing her ample breasts and squeezing them hard.\n\"Let go of me!\" Victoria screamed.\n\"No! You're always pretending.\"\nWith that, he thrust a few more times.\nVictoria bit her lip, trying hard to suppress the moans rising from deep in her throat.\nWilliam's movements became more intense, sweat beading on her forehead. She gripped the seat cushion tightly, unwilling to submit.\nHe suddenly grabbed her waist, thrusting deeply.\nVictoria felt an intense pleasure like an electric current sweeping through her body, making her tremble uncontrollably, \"Let go of me.\"\nShe cried out, but her voice was swallowed by his kiss.\nWilliam thrust forcefully, as if trying to penetrate her body.\nHer body instantly collapsed, limp on the car seat.\nHer body had long adapted to his presence, she could keenly sense his every move.\n\"Moan for me,\" William commanded, continuing to thrust into her.\nVictoria felt dizzy, her vision blurred, her body convulsing uncontrollably, \"William, please, let go of me, please...\"\nWilliam continued to possess her, admiring her intoxicated expression, \"How does it feel, isn't it great?\"\n\"No, no more...\" Victoria's tightly strung nerves suddenly snapped, waves of intense pleasure washing over her, making her faint again, only soft whimpers escaping her lips.\nWilliam was extremely satisfied with her unbearable expression, lowering his head to kiss the corner of her lips.\n\"Baby, let's change positions, you're too tired, you need a break.\"\nWith that, he suddenly flipped over, placing Victoria on top of him, making her lie on his body.\nWilliam held her waist, making her lie more comfortably.\nVictoria felt her whole body burning, her rationality long gone, only William's scorching body temperature reminding her of what they were doing.\nWilliam's deep, magnetic voice sounded in her ear, \"Don't be afraid, I'll be gentle.\"\nHe moved his body slowly, thrusting into her tender spot.\nVictoria felt like her body was about to explode, she couldn't help but whimper, her hands flailing, \"Don't, please, I beg you.\"\nUnfortunately, it was all in vain.\nWilliam ignored her, focusing on enjoying the wonderful sensation of Victoria beneath him.\nHe grabbed her long, slender legs, thrusting hard, each time making Victoria climax uncontrollably, convulsing.\nHer performance pleased William, he suddenly withdrew, then re-entered her body, each thrust more ruthless than the last.\nWhen he finally released, it was two hours later.\nVictoria lay exhausted on the back seat, her eyes red, her face pale, clearly having spent all her energy.\nSeeing this, William frowned, reaching out to smooth her furrowed brows.\n\"Are you that tired?\"\nHearing this, Victoria lifted her head, staring at him blankly, saying nothing.\n\"Looks like you need some rest, so I'll let you off tonight.\" William said, taking out a wet wipe to clean her up, then slowly dressing her.\nAfter tidying up, he sent a message to Harry, who was keeping watch at the intersection, telling him to take a cab home.\nThen he drove Victoria back to her apartment.\nVictoria expressionlessly was about to open the car door when she suddenly heard William call her, handing her a bright red invitation.\nShe took it doubtfully and opened it.\nIt was William and Ella's wedding invitation.",

Why?\" Victoria retorted.\nWhat right did she have to be jealous, especially because of him? \nA mocking smile appeared on William's lips, \"You really are carefree.\"\n\"Thank you for the compliment,\" she replied neither humbly nor arrogantly.\n\"In that case, you won't refuse to be Ella's bridesmaid, will you?\" William raised an eyebrow.\nVictoria was stunned for a second, then angrily said, \"She's crazy, but I'm not! Do I look like a foolishly over-kind person? She's harmed me so many times, and she still wants me to be her bridesmaid! Not a chance!\"\nShe knew exactly what Ella was thinking.\nShe just wanted to use the wedding to humiliate her.\nWilliam laughed, \"Do you think you have the right to refuse?\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together and said nothing.\n\"The wedding is next week. I'll send someone to pick you up for the bridesmaid dress fitting tomorrow,\" William continued.\nAfter he finished speaking, he stepped on the gas, and the car drove out of Victoria's sight, leaving only a trail of exhaust.\nVictoria sat there for a long time before coming back to her senses, looking at the wedding invitation in her hand, feeling a mix of emotions.\nThe next morning, William indeed sent Harry to pick her up.\nIn the car, Harry hesitated, finally unable to hold back, \"Ms. Carter, you and Mr. Scott...\"\n\"Call me Victoria!\" Victoria interrupted him indifferently.\nHarry hesitated for a moment, \"Victoria, actually Mr. Scott still cares about you.\"\n\"Cares? Does he have the time to care about me?\" Victoria sneered.\n\"When you were locked in the basement by Ms. Garcia, it was Mr. Scott who found you first and took you to the hospital.\"\n\"He saved me, but I haven't forgotten how I ended up in that situation. Harry, you should know better than anyone what I've been through because of William.\"\nVictoria looked coldly out the window, \"I just hope that after he gets married, the two of them won't bother me anymore!\"\nHarry sighed and tried to comfort her, \"Victoria, you have every right to be angry. If it were my sister, I'd probably want to fight them too. But Mr. Scott is also quite pitiful; his parents died years ago...\"\n\"Enough,\" Victoria coldly interrupted him, not wanting to hear about William, \"I know his parents died early, but what does his pitiful situation have to do with me? Just because he lost his parents, does that give him the right to bully me?\"\n\"Victoria...\" Harry took a deep breath, wanting to say more.\nBut they had already arrived at the bridal shop.\nVictoria opened the car door and got out, walking towards the bridal shop without looking back.\nThis bridal shop was the best in Silvermist City, featuring top luxury brands from around the world, worth a fortune.\nVictoria stood in front of the display window, lost in thought.\nInside the window were various exquisite and beautiful wedding dresses.\nThere were traditional ones, innovative designs, and more.\nVictoria's gaze swept over the beautiful wedding dresses one by one, but she felt nothing.\nAt this moment, a female sales assistant approached and asked kindly, \"Miss, you are so beautiful, you would look good in any wedding dress. Would you like me to recommend one for you?\"\nVictoria shook her head and said indifferently, \"I'm not here to buy a wedding dress; I'm here to try on a bridesmaid dress. Where is Ms. Garcia?\"\n\"Please follow me,\" she led Victoria upstairs.\nVictoria walked into the VIP room, her expression slightly stunned.\nInside the room, Ella and William were sitting closely on the sofa, chatting.\nIn front of them were a dozen luxurious wedding dresses, each worth a fortune.\nElla was choosing styles while discussing with William, \"William, what do you think of this one?\"\nWilliam glanced at it and nodded, \"It's nice.\"\n\"What about this one?\"\n\"It's fine too.\"\nElla was a bit unhappy, pouting and complaining coquettishly, \"William, you're always so perfunctory. You didn't even look closely.\"\nWilliam affectionately tapped her playful nose, \"Alright, I'll look carefully. How about this one?\"\nElla smiled contentedly, \"Okay, I'll try it on.\"\nShe was about to ask the assistant to take it down for her to try when she turned and saw Victoria standing in front of her.\nShe froze for a moment, then snorted disdainfully, \"You actually came.\"\nVictoria glanced at her expressionlessly and said coldly, \"Didn't you ask me to be your bridesmaid? Ms. Garcia, if you're unhappy, I can leave right now.\"\n\"You!\" Ella glared at Victoria angrily.\nThe reason she asked Victoria to be her bridesmaid was to make this bitch see her place.\nElla was the rightful Mrs. Scott of the Scott family, William's legitimate wife.\nAnd Victoria was just a lowly mistress.\nShe was about to lose her temper when William stopped her, \"Ella, our big day is coming up. Why get upset over someone irrelevant?\"\n\"William, you spoil her too much; that's why she's so arrogant.\"\n\"Alright, go try it on,\" William urged, then imperceptibly cast a quick look at Victoria.\nAlthough Ella was unhappy, she followed William's instructions and went into the fitting room.\nVictoria didn't even look at William, casually finding a corner to sit down.\nIn no time, Ella came out of the fitting room wearing a beige lace strapless wedding dress.\nWilliam's eyes lit up, and he couldn't help but praise, \"Not bad, it suits you well.\"\nHe wasn't just being polite; he genuinely thought the dress suited Ella. Her wheat-colored skin, combined with the strapless and backless design, made her skin look even more radiant.\nElla was very confident in her figure. Hearing William's praise, she proudly glanced at Victoria and said modestly, \"Thank you, William. Now wait for me; I'll go try on the bridal makeup.\"\nBefore leaving, she told the assistant, \"Pick out a few bridesmaid dresses for Ms. Carter. Remember, Ms. Carter is very conservative, so don't make them too revealing.\"\nAs she spoke, she deliberately glanced at Victoria's chest with a malicious look.\nVictoria clenched her fists, barely restraining her anger from tearing Ella's hateful face apart.\nElla then strutted off to the makeup room in her dress.\nThe assistant brought a few bridesmaid dresses for Victoria and then went about her business.\nVictoria took the dresses and went into the fitting room, changing into one of the bridesmaid dresses.\nAs she tied the belt of the bridesmaid dress, a pair of long, straight legs suddenly appeared in the mirror.\nVictoria was startled and turned around abruptly, only to meet William's amused gaze.",

She used all her strength to push William away, quickly tidied herself up, and opened the door as if nothing had happened.\nThe store clerk was stunned when she saw her.\nVictoria's cheeks were flushed, and her eyes were evasive.\nWilliam, without any concealment, swaggered out of the fitting room as well. He slightly raised his chin, not even looking at the store clerk, and walked straight to the sofa to sit down.\nThe store clerk stood there awkwardly.\nSeeing the two of them like this, what else was there not to understand?\nShe just didn't expect an affair to be so blatant.\nShe wisely pretended not to see anything.\nPulling out an awkward smile, she said, \"Ms. Carter, Ms. Garcia's makeup is done. Do you want to try the bridesmaid makeup?\"\n\"Okay.\" Victoria coughed lightly, covering the blush on her face, and followed the store clerk out.\nWilliam also got up and followed.\nElla stood on a round display platform, her wedding dress inlaid with countless diamonds, dazzling and eye-catching.\nThe hem of the wedding dress was embroidered with intricate patterns in silver thread, each pattern exquisite and elegant, luxurious and grand.\nElla wore delicate makeup, her hair styled into a beautiful bun, and with her bright face, it was hard to look away.\nEven Victoria, who disliked her, had to admit that Ella in a wedding dress was indeed stunning.\nSeeing Victoria and William come in together, Ella's originally smiling face instantly turned cold. She snorted lightly and turned her head away.\nWilliam stepped forward, extending his right arm to embrace her shoulder, \"Very beautiful.\"\nElla was delighted to hear this, and her earlier displeasure vanished instantly.\nShe looked up at William, coquettishly asking, \"William, how is it?\"\nWilliam's lips curled into a doting smile, \"Very good, choose this one, and pick a few more as backups.\"\nElla beamed, affectionately holding William's arm, ignoring Victoria on the side. .\nAfter all, she was about to become the rightful Mrs. Scott, so why bother with a lowly mistress.\nAs they left the bridal shop, Ella wanted to ride in the same car as William, but William refused.\n\"Be good, I have to go back to the company for some work. You go home and rest first.\" William patted her cheek, smiling as he instructed.\nElla glanced at Victoria, although unwilling, she didn't say anything.\nShe obediently got into her car, and as the door closed, the smile on her face instantly disappeared, replaced by a heavy gloom.\nThat shameless bitch.\nElla floored the gas pedal, the roaring engine speeding past William and Victoria, kicking up a cloud of dust.\nVictoria covered her nose, frowning as she glared in the direction Ella left.\nWilliam fanned the dust away and asked Victoria, \"Going home? I'll take you.\"\nVictoria shook her head, \"No need, I can go back myself.\"\n\"Really?\" William raised an eyebrow, his tone rising, \"Are you angry?\"\n\"I'm not angry.\" Victoria denied flatly.\n\"Then get in the car.\" William insisted.\nSeeing William's firm attitude, Victoria hesitated for a moment, just about to agree, when a dark blue Bentley suddenly drove up, braking sharply in front of them.\nThe window slowly rolled down, revealing a handsome profile.\nIt was Samuel.",

I heard you were trying on bridesmaid dresses, so I came to take a look.\"\nA mocking smile appeared on William's lips as he coldly questioned, \"Mr. Brown, a college professor, seems to have quite a big business.\"\nSamuel smiled and said, \"It's nothing much, just some small-scale businesses, nothing compared to the Scott family's vast empire.\"\nWilliam glanced at Victoria mockingly and said nonchalantly, \"Mr. Brown is really modest.\"\nSamuel couldn't be bothered to argue with him and turned to Victoria, speaking gently, \"Victoria, get in the car, I'll take you home.\"\nWilliam's face grew even darker.\nVictoria looked at William, then at Samuel, and finally got into Samuel's car.\nWilliam watched them leave, his face as dark as a stormy sky, exuding a terrifying gloom.\nHarry drove over to pick him up.\nWilliam took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, took a deep drag, and exhaled the smoke.\nHe leaned back in his seat, squinting his eyes as he gazed into the distance.\nAfter a while, he extinguished the cigarette and casually asked, \"That Samuel is he from the Brown family in Prosperity City?\"\nHarry nodded, recalling, \"Yes, he's the eldest son of the Brown family.

Tell us quickly,\" the bridesmaids urged.\nElla smiled proudly, \"Since William's parents died, Daisy has been taking care of him. You could say she's like half a mother to him. I've told her all about Victoria seducing William. Daisy is very strict with her principles and bottom line, and she hates sleazy women. Victoria is definitely in for a bad time this time.\"\nVictoria followed Daisy to the lawn outside the hotel, under a dense sycamore tree. Daisy leaned against the tree trunk, her posture elegant and lazy.\n\"Ms. Scott,\" Victoria called out.\nDaisy turned her face slightly, giving Victoria a faint glance, her expression indifferent and her gaze sharp, \"Ms. Carter, please sit down.\"\nVictoria obediently sat on the chair beside her.\nDaisy also sat down opposite her, carefully examining her.\nVictoria's skin was smooth and translucent, her features exquisite and beautiful, her brows full of liveliness and charm, especially her gem-like eyes, clear and bright.\nBeing stared at by Daisy's sharp gaze made Victoria a bit uneasy. She awkwardly tugged at the corner of her mouth, \"Ms. Scott.\"\n\"You've grown up,\" Daisy suddenly said. Victoria felt a bit puzzled but still responded obediently.\nDaisy looked into the distant blue sky and slowly said, \"I attended your tenth birthday party. I still remember you wore a white puffy dress that day, with two pigtails on your head, looking very cute.\"\nVictoria felt she had seen her somewhere before and now remembered that Daisy had appeared with Alvin at that time.\nNora had seen the two of them and angrily pointed at Daisy, saying, \"Your dad is running away with that woman, and you still have the mood to celebrate your birthday.\"\nVictoria knew that Nora and Alvin were going through a divorce at that time, but she didn't know the specific reason.\nHearing Nora say that, she really thought Alvin was having an affair and went up to try to drive Daisy away.\nThen she was scolded. That was the only time Alvin had scolded her.\nSo Victoria remembered it very clearly.\n\"Are you a friend of my dad?\" Victoria asked tentatively.\n\"You could say that,\" Daisy sneered, \"You should ask your dad about the entanglements between us, as it involves your mom's privacy.\"\nHearing this, Victoria was even more certain that she had a close relationship with Alvin.\nShe pursed her lips and continued to ask, \"So why are you looking for me...\"\n\"Did you sleep with William?\" Daisy interrupted, her tone strong and pressing.\nShe didn't like to beat around the bush.\nVictoria was stunned for a moment, then nodded, \"Yes.\"\nDaisy's face instantly turned gloomy, \"Did he threaten you?\"\nVictoria didn't know how to answer. It was indeed a threat.\nBut at the beginning, when she was desperate and borrowing money everywhere for Nora's illness, only William gave her a way out.\nAlthough this way out was at the cost of her dignity, Victoria had to admit that William helped her.\nBecause it was the best choice at that time.\nAt least William was a handsome young man, not those greasy old men with big bellies.\nVictoria lowered her eyes and thought for a moment, then slowly said, \"It wasn't exactly a threat.\"\nDaisy frowned slightly, \"Victoria, I have some connections with your father, so I don't want to see you get hurt. William's thoughts and feelings towards you are not as simple as you think. He wants to...\"\nShe paused, seemingly considering her words, then said, \"In short, you should leave him as soon as possible and stop getting entangled with him.\"\nVictoria didn't quite understand Daisy's words, but she knew they were for her own good.\n\"Thank you for warning me. He's getting married today, so I don't think we'll have much interaction in the future,\" Victoria said softly.\nShe didn't want to delve into it, as feelings couldn't be forced.\n\"That's good,\" Daisy smiled with relief and changed the topic, \"Since you're his lover, why are you here as a bridesmaid for his fiancée today?\"\nVictoria was stunned, then shook her head and said bitterly, \"Ella invited me.\"\nDaisy was surprised, then frowned, \"Is this a joke? It's not enough for William to bully you alone, he has to bring his fiancée to humiliate you too? Is there such a way to bully people?\"\nVictoria was about to say it was voluntary, but Daisy grabbed her hand and pulled her away, \"Come on, I'll help you settle accounts with him!\"\n\"Ms. Scott!\" Victoria called out urgently, trying to stop Daisy, but unfortunately, she wasn't strong enough to break free.\nWilliam had changed into his groom's suit, a white suit that fit his tall and slender figure perfectly.\nHe hadn't put on any makeup, and his hair was the same as usual.\nThere wasn't much joy on his face, instead, he looked even colder than usual.\nHe stood in front of the mirror, picking up his tie, about to put it around his neck.\nThe door suddenly opened, and he turned his head.\nDaisy stood at the door, pulling Victoria, her face full of anger.\nWilliam raised an eyebrow at her, then looked at Victoria behind her and couldn't help but smile, \"How did you two get together?\"\nDaisy took a few steps forward, looking down at William, \"William, how could you treat Victoria like this?\"\n\"What did I do?\" William raised an eyebrow nonchalantly, clearly not feeling any guilt for his actions.\n\"You still ask what you did?\" Daisy stepped forward and grabbed his ear, gritting her teeth, \"It's bad enough that you coerced a young girl, but you also made her be a bridesmaid. Do you really have to humiliate her like this? Is it very honorable to bully a helpless girl?\"",

        "content": "William gasped in pain, reaching out his left hand to block Daisy from grabbing his arm. \"What nonsense are you talking about? When did I ever bully her?\"\n\"Still denying it!\" Daisy glared at him. \"Your fiancée told me everything. She even exaggerated, describing Victoria as a gold-digger who clings to the rich and powerful. Does she think I'm as stupid as her and have no discernment at all?\"\nWilliam's brows furrowed tightly, his face turning ashen.\nHe looked in Victoria's direction and saw her pale face, with beads of sweat on her forehead, seemingly frightened. A surge of irritation and anger rose in his heart.\nHe knew Ella was foolish, but he didn't expect her to be this foolish.\nShe even dared to tattle to Daisy.\nDidn't she consider that Daisy, having been in the business world for so long, had encountered all kinds of people? How could she not see through her?\nAnd she still foolishly thought she could use her eloquence to distort the truth?\nHow utterly stupid.\nIf it weren't for Alice...\nThinking of this, William sighed and patiently explained to Daisy, \"Aunt Daisy, I neither hit her nor scolded her. How did I bully her? Just because her father...\"\n\"Shut up!\" Daisy glanced at Victoria and interrupted William. \"Even if her father committed a crime, the law has already punished him. Do you want her to bear the consequences as well? You just find her pretty and are lusting after her. Don't give me so many excuses.\"\nWilliam helplessly rubbed his brow and sighed, \"Aunt Daisy.\"\nHe wanted to say something to calm the furious Daisy.\nJust then, Harry pushed the door open and, seeing the scene before him, paused for a moment before saying, \"Mr. Scott, the bride is ready, and the officiant and guests have almost all arrived.\"\nWilliam responded, \"Okay.\"\nThen, Daisy let go of him, smoothed out her clothes as if there were wrinkles, gave him a cold look, and snorted, \"Victoria will stay with me today. She won't be your bridesmaid anymore. You have so many bridesmaids; you won't miss one.\"\nHearing this, William frowned, his gaze falling on Victoria, remaining silent.\nDaisy, pulling Victoria protectively, gave William a warning look before leading the pale Victoria out of the room and towards the lawn.\nWilliam watched their backs disappear from sight before turning to follow them out.\nWhen Ella learned that Victoria had been taken away by Daisy and could no longer be her bridesmaid, she was not angry but extremely happy.\nShe thought Daisy disliked Victoria and had deliberately taken her away, which suited her perfectly.\nElla, fully dressed, lifted her skirt and walked down the red carpet, swaying her slender waist.\nHer cheeks were flushed, looking stunningly beautiful, with a face full of happiness and joy.\nShe caught a glimpse of William coming out of the lounge and gave him a charming smile, calling out sweetly, \"William.\"\nHearing her soft and seductive voice, William nodded expressionlessly.\nElla was already used to his hot-and-cold attitude and approached him, taking his arm as they walked towards the stage.\nThe wedding was held on the lawn, decorated with roses flown in from abroad, making it both romantic and luxurious.\nPetals fell like rain, filling the air with a rich floral fragrance.\nWith flowers paving the way, William and Ella walked down the aisle, drawing everyone's attention.\nBy this time, the guests were already seated, most of them prominent figures from Silvermist City, along with some celebrities from the entertainment industry.\nAt William and Ella's wedding, only Daisy from the Scott family attended.\nMost of the Scott family's influence was in Harborview City. William's grandfather was old and in poor health, so William didn't want to tire him out. He planned to visit him with Ella after the wedding.\nAs for Wayne's family, they mostly stayed abroad since William's parents died, only returning for holidays.\nIn essence, the Garcia family wasn't significant enough for them to pay much attention.\nAnd William himself had no real affection for Ella, so he didn't give her much face.\nEven if the Garcia family knew Ella was being slighted, they couldn't say much.\nVictoria sat in the audience, her abdominal pain from enteritis causing her to break out in a cold sweat, forcing her to lean on Daisy's shoulder.\nDaisy, feeling Victoria's body growing weaker, looked at her worriedly and asked softly, \"Victoria, are you okay?\"\nVictoria shook her head.\nDaisy touched her pale face, \"Do you want me to take you to the hospital?\"\n\"No, no need,\" Victoria refused, looking up at Daisy. \"The wedding is about to start. It's not good to leave now.\"\nIf she left early, Ella might overthink it and cause trouble.\nMore importantly, she wanted to see William put the wedding ring on Ella with her own eyes. That way, she could completely let go of her hidden feelings.\nWilliam stood on the stage, his deep eyes scanning the surroundings before finally resting on Victoria in the corner.\nSeeing her leaning on Daisy, looking uncomfortable, he couldn't help but curl his lips.\nSo, Victoria wasn't completely emotionless after all?\nAt least she felt bad seeing him get married.\nAfter the wedding, he would go and comfort her.\nWilliam lowered his gaze and slowly looked away.\nElla, seeing William smile at Victoria, felt a pang of jealousy.\nBut at this moment, she knew to maintain her composure.\nDespite her anger, she kept a gentle and graceful smile on her face.\n\"Please exchange rings, bride and groom!\" The officiant's clear voice drew everyone's attention to William and Ella.\nElla, smiling brightly, extended her right hand to William.\nWilliam picked up a diamond ring and was about to put it on her when a distinctive phone ringtone sounded.\nHis movements suddenly halted. Ignoring Ella's displeased expression and the murmurs from the audience, he took out his phone and answered it.\nElla only heard a familiar voice from his phone. \"William, I'm back.\"\nElla's pupils contracted, and her fingers clutching her wedding dress lost their color.\nWilliam's face also changed, and he jumped off the stage, discarding the groom's boutonniere as he quickly left.\n\"William!\" Ella shouted, trying to make him stay, but before she could finish, William had already turned the corner and disappeared from her sight.\nElla stood frozen, watching William's departing figure. Her mind felt like it exploded, her vision darkened, and she fainted on the stage.\nThe voice on the phone just now was her sister Alice's.",

        "content": "William's sudden departure caused a commotion among the audience, and the Garcia family was even more panicked, busy helping the unconscious Ella while calling the fleeing William, hoping he would come back quickly.\nThe other guests were even more talkative, with all kinds of speculations emerging.\n\"What happened?\"\n\"Why did Mr. Scott leave suddenly? Could something have happened?\"\n\"Who knows, maybe he ran away from the wedding?\"\nDaisy didn't expect such a change either, her face darkened as she looked at the chaotic wedding scene.\nThis William, still so unruly, dared to run away from the wedding at the last minute!\nThe Scott family's face has been completely lost by him!\nVictoria also didn't expect William to leave suddenly.\nShe was stunned for a moment, then lowered her head and covered her stomach, the pain intensifying, making her groan a few times.\nDaisy noticed Victoria's abnormality and quickly reached out to support her, nervously shouting, \"Victoria, are you okay?\"\nVictoria gritted her teeth to endure the pain and shook her head at Daisy, \"I'm fine, don't worry.\"\nDaisy frowned, \"You look terrible.\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together without speaking, just feeling the pain getting worse, with fine beads of sweat appearing on her forehead.\nSeeing her face getting paler, Daisy knew she couldn't delay any longer and immediately helped her up, \"Let's go, I'll take you to the hospital.\"\nVictoria was in so much pain that she couldn't speak, barely following Daisy out.\nAlong the way, they encountered many guests, but Daisy was in a hurry to take Victoria to the hospital and didn't bother to greet anyone, just kept supporting Victoria and hurriedly left.\nWilliam arrived at the airport, searching for that familiar figure among the bustling crowd.\nFinally, in the lounge area, he spotted the person he had been longing for.\nShe was quietly curled up on a seat, looking at the passing crowd, her delicate face pale and bloodless, with long, thick eyelashes covering her eyes.\nWilliam felt a sharp pain in his chest, as if a blunt object had shattered his heart.\nHis feet felt like they were filled with lead, unable to move a step, just staring fixedly at that slender figure.\nWhat happened to her? Why is she so weak? Is she sick?\nHis heart ached with pain.\nHad she not been doing well abroad these past few years?\nWilliam approached her step by step, each step taken very slowly, as if it took all his courage.\nSensing someone approaching, Alice turned her head, and the first thing she saw was the well-dressed, handsome William.\n\"William!\" Alice slightly parted her lips, revealing a sweet smile.\nHer voice was soft and sweet, like a small brush gently scratching William's heart, making him feel a tingling sensation all over; he wished he could offer her the best things in the world just to see her smile.\nWilliam clenched his fists, trying to suppress the emotions surging in his heart, his gaze burning as he stared at her.\nLooking at the tall William in front of her, Alice's cheeks turned red, and she shyly called out, \"William, I'm back!\"\n\"Welcome home.\" Seeing her smile, William felt his heart melt, just like years ago when she waited for him at the school gate to go home together.\nHer smile was always as gentle and intoxicating as the spring breeze in March, making him unable to resist.\nHe thought of the days he spent with her, how she always loved to stick by his side and talk, like a little butterfly fluttering around his ears, infusing his dull life with new energy.\nThose memories were so distant, so distant that he had forgotten how much he missed that time.\nIf it weren't for him back then, she wouldn't have suffered from kidney failure due to excessive drinking and wouldn't have left him.\nWilliam bent down and hugged Alice, his voice hoarse as he spoke, \"Do you know how much I missed you?\"\nThese words were like a sweet and mellow spring, flowing through Alice's heart, warming her entire being.\nAlice's mouth curved into a happy, sweet smile, obediently nestling in his arms, softly responding, \"I know.\"\n\"Then why didn't you come back earlier?\" William lowered his head, staring at her intently.\n\"After all, we promised Ella back then.\" Alice was stunned for a moment, then raised her head, blinking her clear, bright eyes, and pouted aggrievedly, \"But when I heard you were really going to marry her, I couldn't stand it! So I found a way to escape from the bodyguards watching me and came back. Look, I even sprained my foot.\"\nShe lifted her swollen left foot to show him, her bright, beautiful eyes filled with tears, looking at him pitifully, making him feel a surge of pity.\n\"I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.\" William's tone softened, as gentle as a feather brushing against the skin, \"I'll take you to the hospital for a check-up now, okay?\"\nAlice nodded obediently, her eyes moist, \"Okay.\"\nWilliam picked her up and walked to the parking lot, got into the Maybach, and sped towards the hospital.\nDaisy had just arrived at the hospital with Victoria when they ran into the anxious Samuel.\nVictoria was surprised to see him and asked, \"Samuel, why are you here?\"\nSamuel looked at her pale face and said with concern, \"Our bridal shop needs to keep following up with big clients and provide ongoing makeup services. The makeup artist told me you were being helped out of the venue, looking like you were sick, so I came to the nearest hospital to try my luck. What's wrong with you?\"\n\"I just ate something bad, it's not a big deal.\" Victoria smiled bitterly; seeing Daisy looking at Samuel, she introduced, \"Ms. Scott, this is Samuel Brown, my friend.\"\nSamuel politely nodded to her and followed Victoria's address, \"Ms. Scott, hello.\"\nDaisy saw that although Samuel seemed much older than Victoria, he exuded an extraordinary and elegant aura, clearly not an ordinary person.\nShe nodded in satisfaction, thinking Samuel was much better than the unruly William.\nThat bastard William, if he continues to be so stubborn, he will regret it in the future.\nAnd if that happens, it will be his own fault!\nSeeing Victoria in so much pain, Samuel didn't bother with pleasantries and immediately carried her to the emergency room.\nThe doctor gave her a thorough examination and finally told Victoria that it was nothing serious, just a bit of gastroenteritis, and she just needed a few days of IV fluids.\nSeeing that she was fine, Daisy instructed Victoria to rest well and then went home.\nSamuel stayed by her side, patiently taking care of her.\nHis meticulous care made the nurses envious, sighing that older lovers are indeed more considerate!\nSamuel bought some strawberries, washed them, and fed them to her one by one.\nVictoria felt a bit embarrassed, blushing as she declined, \"Samuel, I can do it myself.\"\nSamuel picked one up and put it in her mouth, smiling, \"I finally found a chance to be attentive to you, why not let me do it?\"\nVictoria's mouth was stuffed with a strawberry, her cheeks puffed out, just about to swallow it.\nThen she saw William carrying a beautiful and fragile woman come in.",

His features were stern, with sharp eyebrows and starry eyes.\nHis deep eyes, usually indifferent and distant, were filled with infinite tenderness and affection when he looked at Alice in his arms.\nAlice, in his arms, was petite and delicate, with shoulder-length hair, smooth skin, and exquisite features. Her almond-shaped eyes sparkled with a captivating charm.\nHer face was stunning enough to captivate anyone, and with just one glance, she could bewitch anyone.\nCould it be that William ran away from the wedding because of this woman?\nWouldn't Ella be furious with her?\nThinking of Ella's radiant smile before the wedding and then seeing her faint from anger when William ran away, Victoria felt a mix of emotions and couldn't help but sigh.\nShe admitted that she was somewhat happy to see Ella humiliated, but as a woman, she also felt a bit of sympathy for her.\nShe knew how much Ella loved William.\nTo be humiliated by the person you love the most at your wedding, how desperate must that be?\nWilliam didn't expect to run into Victoria here. Seeing the IV in her hand and Samuel feeding her strawberries beside her, his handsome brows furrowed.\nAlice noticed him stop and followed his gaze, seeing the young girl receiving an IV.\nShe was wearing a bridesmaid dress with a man's coat draped over her.\nShe looked delicate and pretty, with smooth skin, exquisite features, watery eyes, and pink lips. She appeared very fragile, like a doll.\nHowever, her chest was full, especially her breasts, which subtly moved with her breathing, looking particularly enticing.\nPure yet seductive, she was the dream woman for any man.\nThe four of them exchanged glances, and the atmosphere momentarily froze.\nSamuel looked at William and discreetly placed his arm behind Victoria, adopting a protective stance.\nVictoria noticed but didn't reject it; instead, she leaned closer to him.\nWilliam withdrew his gaze, holding Alice as he walked towards Victoria. He glanced at her indifferently and said coldly, \"Why are you in the hospital?\"\nVictoria bit her lip and remained silent for a moment before slowly saying, \"Thank you for your concern, Mr. Scott. I just had an upset stomach.\"\nHer attitude was neither humble nor arrogant, as if they weren't very familiar.\nWilliam then remembered that she had seemed unwell all day.\nHe had thought it was because he was getting married, but it turned out she had a stomachache.\nRealizing this, he felt he had been assuming too much.\nHis expression grew colder, and he didn't even bother to look at her again. Holding Alice, he walked past them and continued forward.\nVictoria heard Alice in his arms ask him, \"Who is she?\"\nWilliam replied nonchalantly, \"She used to be an employee at my company, but she has resigned.\"\nAn employee?\nVictoria found William's words somewhat amusing.\nShe endured the twisting pain in her abdomen, tightly pressed her pale lips together, and lowered her head.\nMeanwhile, The Garcia Villa was already in chaos.\nAfter Ella momentarily fainted from anger, Willow was about to take her to the hospital for a check-up.\nHowever, Ella returned to The Garcia Villa without saying a word, locked herself in her room, and no matter how much Willow called, she didn't open the door.\n\"Say something! You're worrying me to death!\" Willow paced anxiously outside the door.\nShe couldn't believe that little bitch Alice had managed to escape from the bodyguards and caused Ella such distress!\nUnbelievable!\nAlice's mother had given Willow a hard time back then, and now Alice had broken Ella's heart. Did they think they were easy to bully?\nWhen Alice returned, she would definitely teach her a lesson.\nZachary sat on the sofa, his face dark with anger.\nHis son-in-law had run away from the wedding because of his other daughter. If this got out, the Garcia family's reputation would be ruined.\nHe was about to order someone to find Alice when the Garcia family's butler reported that Alice had returned.\nWillow rushed to the door, ready to scold her, but when she looked up, she met William's cold gaze and was momentarily stunned.\nWillow knew William's nature all too well. He was cold-blooded and ruthless, with no heart.\nHe loved Alice the most, and for others, even Zachary, he didn't care.\nShe didn't dare to scold anymore and closed her mouth awkwardly.\nZachary sighed when he saw William bringing Alice back.\nHe felt guilty about Alice's mother. If he hadn't cheated on her with Willow and had Ella, Alice's mother wouldn't have died of depression.\nEven though Alice had ruined Ella's wedding, he couldn't bring himself to be angry with her.\n\"You're back,\" Zachary greeted calmly.\nWilliam responded and led Alice into the living room, sitting her on the sofa and comforting her softly, \"It's okay, everything's fine.\"\nAlice nodded, her eyes red as she nestled into his arms. She cautiously said to Zachary, \"Dad, I'm sorry. It's my fault for causing you trouble.\"\nAs she spoke, tears streamed down her face.\nWilliam patted her back, soothing her trembling emotions.\n\"Alice, you bitch!\" A furious shout came from the stairs, accompanied by the sound of high heels on the steps.\nElla stood on the stairs, pointing at Alice and cursing, \"You knew today was my wedding with William, but you came back on purpose! You wanted to ruin our wedding, didn't you? You bitch, I'll kill you!\"\nShe rushed forward to hit Alice.\nWilliam stood in front of Alice, grabbing Ella's swinging arm forcefully. His cold, harsh gaze swept over Zachary and Willow. \"This is my fault. I'll make it up to you.\"\nElla was so angry that her lungs hurt.\nShe stared at him in disbelief, her voice sharp as she questioned, \"Make it up? How? By having another wedding?\"\nWilliam didn't answer, and Alice shook her head, sobbing, \"I'm sorry, Ella. I can't give William to you. It's my fault. You can hit me or punish me, but please give William back to me. I'll do anything you want.\"\n\"You! You!\"\nAlice's every word was like a knife stabbing into Ella's heart. She suddenly took off her dress, leaving only her underwear, exposing her body to everyone.\nShe pointed to a scar on her stomach, crying out, \"Alice, are you even human? I gave you one of my kidneys to get the engagement with William, and now you want me to give him back? What about my kidney? Will you give it back to me?\"",

Ella, if you really hate me, you can take your kidney back! I've made up my mind, even if I die, I won't let William go to you.\" Alice cried bitterly.\nElla was stunned, her eyes wide with shock, unable to believe that Alice could say something so shameless.\nHer chest heaved with anger, and she pointed a trembling finger at Alice, saying, \"You... you, you bitch, are you even human? Fine, you want to give it back to me, right?\"\nAs she spoke, Ella grabbed a fruit knife from nearby and lunged at Alice.\nSeeing this, William's expression changed, and he kicked Ella away.\nWith a loud crash, Ella fell to the floor, hitting her forehead on the corner of the coffee table, immediately drawing blood.\nA wave of searing pain hit her, and Ella screamed in agony.\n\"Ella!\" Willow screamed, rushing over to support her. \"Are you okay, Ella? Does it hurt?\"\nElla was in too much pain to speak, and Willow, panicking, pulled out her phone and dialed 911. \"I need an ambulance, please help, my daughter is hurt!\"\nShe cried out, her voice hoarse and heart-wrenching.\nWilliam glanced coldly at the blood-covered Ella, his brow furrowing, his gaze growing even colder.\nSeeing his indifferent attitude, Willow became even more furious and shouted at Alice, \"Alice, you damn bastard, if anything happens to her, I won't let you off!\"\nAlice's eyes filled with tears as she cowered beside William, silently wiping her eyes.\nWilliam pulled her into his arms, comforting her softly, \"It's okay, I'm here.\"\nThen he turned to Ella and said, \"I said I would compensate you on her behalf. If you want ten million dollars, or even a hundred million dollars, just say the word; I can give it to you. But from now on, Alice owes you nothing.\"\nElla felt that the pain from her head injury was nothing compared to the pain William's words caused her.\nShe suddenly laughed, looking at William with a sorrowful expression, \"William, I risked my life for you, and this is how you treat me? You keep humiliating and hurting me for this mentally unstable Alice...\"\n\"Enough! Ella, stop talking! I don't care what you think.\" William couldn't hold back and interrupted her.\n\"Fine, I brought this on myself.\" Ella laughed bitterly, slowly getting up from the floor and heading upstairs.\nWillow thought she was going to change clothes and quickly followed, \"Sweetie, I'll go with you to change clothes.\"\nWilliam glanced in their direction and said to Zachary, \"Mr. Garcia, Alice just got back, I'll take her to my place to rest for a while.\"\n\"Alright, go ahead.\" Zachary sighed helplessly, watching everything unfold.\nWilliam picked up Alice and strode out.\nJust as they stepped out of the living room, a dark figure suddenly fell from above, landing in front of them.\nAlice screamed in fright.\nIt was Ella!\nShe lay on the ground, half of her body stained with blood.\nWillow looked down from the third floor, seeing Ella covered in blood, she was so scared that her legs gave out and she collapsed to the floor, unable to speak.\nWilliam pressed his lips together, squatted down to check on Ella.\nAfter a moment, he said in a deep voice, \"Take her to the hospital.\"\nAlice stared blankly at Ella's horrific state, her eyes gradually turning blood-red.\nA few days later, Victoria went back to the hospital for a follow-up as per the doctor's orders.\nAfterward, she quietly peeked into Nora's room.\nAlthough she had decided not to care about her anymore, she couldn't help but check on her condition.\nThe young nurse saw her and couldn't help but sigh, \"Nora has such a good daughter, but she wasn't cherished. It's really foolish.\"\nIf anyone treated Victoria well, she would give her heart and soul in return.\nThe nurse stepped forward and led Victoria aside, \"Ms. Carter, you don't need to worry too much. Your mother's condition is quite stable, and she has caregivers looking after her. You can rest assured.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Victoria nodded. \"Please take good care of my mom.\"\n\"It's our duty,\" the nurse smiled.\nVictoria was about to leave when the nurse stopped her and asked, \"Ms. Carter, do you know someone named Ella?\"\nAfter all, the story of Victoria, William, and Ella was no secret in the hospital.\nVictoria was taken aback, then nodded, \"I know her.\"\nThe nurse continued gossiping, \"She jumped off her house, did you know?\"\n\"Jumped... jumped off her house?\" Victoria's mind buzzed. Ella actually jumped off a building?\nThe nurse shook her head, \"I don't know the details, but it seems she jumped from the third floor. Luckily, she fell into a flower bed, so her life isn't in danger, but she's seriously injured.\"\nVictoria left the nurse's station in a daze.\nShe couldn't believe that Ella would have such a strong and impulsive nature, willing to jump off a building and risk her life.\nHow deep must her love be?\nVictoria shook her head. No matter how deep the love, if you fell for the wrong person, it was destined to be a tragedy.\nMoreover, doing this only brings pain to those who care and joy to those who hate.\nPeople would be glad to see you gone, out of their way.\nAs Victoria took the elevator to the first-floor lobby, she saw Willow pushing Ella's wheelchair, waiting for the elevator.\nEven though Victoria knew Ella was seriously injured, seeing her in this state still shocked her.\nElla's face was pale, her arms and legs wrapped in bandages, even her head and neck were covered in gauze.\nExcept for her face, she looked like a mummy.\nVictoria stared at her, unable to react for a long time.\nElla also saw Victoria.\nHer previously lifeless face suddenly filled with intense hatred. She glared at Victoria and cursed through gritted teeth, \"Bitch! Are you here to laugh at me?\"",

Ridiculous.\" Victoria's lips twitched as she mocked, \"Do you think everyone's interested in you?\"\n\"You...\" Ella had just opened her mouth when a sharp pain surged through her body, causing her to groan in pain.\nWillow quickly reached out to hold her, \"Ella, what's wrong?\"\nVictoria couldn't be bothered to argue with her and lifted her foot to leave.\nSeeing this, Ella hurriedly called out to her, \"Victoria, I have something to say to you!\"\nVictoria stopped in her tracks, her back to Ella, and mocked, \"What? Haven't you insulted me enough?\"\nElla signaled Willow to push her wheelchair in front of Victoria.\nBecause it was a private hospital, there weren't many patients.\n\"Victoria, if I were you, I would never be a mistress hiding in the shadows. I would do everything I could to win him over and be his legitimate girlfriend!\" Ella stared at Victoria with a vicious look.\nHearing this, Victoria squinted slightly, \"Ella, you lost the man to someone else and now you want to incite me to get involved in this complicated mess, hoping to kill two birds with one stone? Do you think everyone is as stupid as you?\"\n\"Do you dare say you haven't coveted him?\" Ella sneered, \"Do you think pretending to be pure and weak can hide your ugly desires?\"\nVictoria didn't deny it and retorted, \"Compared to someone like you who loses their mind for love, I am indeed very smart, much smarter than you! And let me tell you, I have no interest in your William. If he hadn't forced me, I would have stayed far away from you two!\"\nHearing this, Ella's face turned extremely ugly, \"You're lying! If you weren't good at seducing men, why would William always be infatuated with you? As his fiancée, he has never touched me...\"\n\"Shut up!\" Victoria interrupted her coldly, \"I have no interest in your relationship, nor do I want to get involved in your love triangle.\"\nWith that, she turned to leave.\n\"Do you think saying that will make her let you go?\" Ella suddenly laughed, \"Alice Garcia is a lunatic! As long as she knows you've been with William for so long, you won't have a good ending!\"\nHearing this, Victoria stopped abruptly and turned to look at Ella.\nAlice? Was she the woman William was holding that day?\nCould she be Ella's sister?\nElla's expression was twisted and crazed as she spoke word by word, \"My dear sister, who seems harmless and gentle, is actually terrifyingly vicious!\"\nAs she spoke, she struggled to lift her clothes, revealing a horrifying scar to Victoria, \"Look at this! This is the scar from when I donated a kidney to her! She promised that if I gave her my kidney, she would let me marry William. But as you saw, on my wedding day, she showed up and effortlessly took William away! Now I'm missing a kidney and being ridiculed by countless people because the groom ran away! And all of this was orchestrated by my dear sister!\"\nBy the end, Ella was screaming hysterically.\nVictoria listened quietly to Ella's accusations and finally spoke after a long pause, \"I told you, I'm not interested in your affairs. Whatever you want to do is your business, don't drag me into it.\"\nWith that, she didn't linger any longer and walked towards the door.\nElla seemed to hear an extremely ridiculous joke, \"Do you think you can stay out of it? Just wait, your end might be worse than mine.\"\nVictoria ignored her and left directly.\nStarry Studio Gallery recently took on a project to design the display for a newly opened home goods department store.\nThe owner of this building had always been a major client of Starry Studio Gallery, so Diana paid extra attention to this design, ensuring every detail was perfect.\nVictoria, Wendy, and the other dozen employees of Starry Studio Gallery, along with the store staff, worked overtime for almost a month to get it mostly done.\nOnly minor adjustments were needed.\nThe building's owner also opened for a trial run, only for some VIP members.\nVictoria had been on-site these days, recording and adjusting based on customer feedback and attitudes.\nWhile she was working diligently, her phone kept ringing non-stop.\nAnnoyed, Victoria took it out and saw it was that idle rich kid again.\nThe rich kid's name was Alton Bridges, the son of the home goods department store's owner, and a college student.\nA while ago, when he came to inspect the mall on behalf of his father, Diana assigned Victoria to accompany him and listen to his feedback.\nAfter getting to know each other, Alton, for some reason, broke up with his girlfriend and started pursuing Victoria madly.\nEvery day, he sent flowers, food, and luxury goods non-stop, despite Victoria's constant rejections and polite indications that she wasn't interested in him.\nBut this guy was like velcro, impossible to shake off.\nAfter the phone rang for a long time, it finally stopped.\nVictoria breathed a sigh of relief.\nJust as she was about to check the layout and decor of the hall for any needed adjustments, she saw Alton having someone carry 444 roses, standing in the center of the hall, shouting at her, \"Victoria!\"\nVictoria was silent.\nEveryone around was silent too.\n\"Oh my god, is this handsome guy confessing to this lady?\"\n\"Of course! Who else would send 444 roses? It's so romantic!\"\n\"So lucky!\"\nVictoria, however, didn't feel romantic or lucky at all.\nShe only felt extremely embarrassed.\nShe lowered her head, pretending not to see him, and used the blueprint to cover her face, wanting to leave this place quickly.\nBut the more she avoided him, the more persistent Alton became.\n\"Victoria! Victoria! The one in the brown coat, Victoria, look over here!\" Alton waved his arms excitedly, shouting.\n\"Victoria, why don't you go over and talk to him?\" Wendy teased, having heard the commotion, her eyes sparkling with anticipation to see Victoria's reaction.\nVictoria glared at her and walked over helplessly.\n\"Victoria, do you like these roses?\" Alton smiled brightly, showing his white teeth.\nVictoria was overwhelmed by the strong floral scent and sneezed.\nShe quickly covered her nose, \"Mr. Bridges, I can't accept these flowers, I'm really sorry.\"\n\"Don't be like that!\" Alton looked at her with a face full of grievance, \"I really like you.\"\nVictoria sighed, \"I'm sorry, you're not my type. Please give up.\"\nAlton was stunned, then asked, \"What type do you like?\"\nVictoria thought for a moment and decided to use Samuel's standards, \"I like mature, steady, gentlemanly types who also appreciate art like I do.\"\nAnd her words were all overheard by William, who was there with Alice to pick out furniture.",

        "content": "Alice moved into The Scott Villa.\nBut her home was filled with minimalist gray furniture.\nIt didn't match Alice at all.\nWho would have thought there would be such a big drama?\nShe liked mature and steady types?\nIs she talking about Samuel?\nWilliam's eyes narrowed slightly, and he unconsciously tightened his grip on Alice's hand.\n\"Ouch!\" Alice exclaimed softly, complaining in pain, \"William, you're hurting me.\"\nWilliam snapped back to reality and realized he almost hurt Alice. He immediately let go and apologized, \"I'm sorry, Alice.\"\n\"It's okay, I don't blame you,\" Alice said sweetly.\nThen, she discreetly looked at Victoria, who was standing in front of the roses, blushing from their fragrance.\nVictoria was wearing a black cropped wool sweater with jeans, a brown coat over it, her long hair tied up in a high ponytail, revealing her slender neck, looking particularly bright and dazzling.\nSeeing her like this, a dark shadow flashed in Alice's eyes.\nVictoria.\nAlton felt a bit disappointed hearing Victoria's response.\nBut he didn't give up; instead, he became more determined and expressed his thoughts, \"Victoria, although I can't be the way you like right now, I will work hard. Just wait and see!\"\nWith that, he turned and ran off.\nLeaving Victoria speechless, staring at the enormous bouquet of roses.\nVictoria was worrying about how to handle the flowers when Wendy whispered in her ear, \"Victoria, look over there, who is that?\"\nFollowing Wendy's gaze, Victoria saw William in a dark casual suit, looking relaxed.\nHe was holding the hand of Alice, who looked like a fairy tale princess.\nThey were a perfect match.\nIn Victoria's memory, she had never seen William shopping.\nIt seemed he was accompanying Alice to pick out furniture today.\nHe was really thoughtful.\nAnd now, Alice no longer looked as pale and haggard as when she first saw her in the hospital.\nHer face had a healthy rosy glow, and she wore a sweet, shy smile.\nIt seemed William was taking good care of her.\nSeeing her radiant appearance, Victoria couldn't help but think of Ella's weak and miserable state in the hospital.\nShe remembered the hideous and terrifying wounds on her body.\nAnd now, her sister Alice was holding her ex-fiancé's hand, looking sweet and happy.\nThe stark contrast left Victoria in a daze.\nWhen she came back to her senses, William had already walked past her with Alice, expressionless.\nVictoria stood there in a daze for a long time.\nUntil Wendy nudged her, \"Victoria, are you okay?\"\nVictoria snapped back to reality and shook her head, \"I'm fine. I was just thinking about how to handle all these roses.\"\nWendy looked at the crowd gathering around and suggested, \"How about we make a rose display? After all, it's bought by a client's son, so it's reasonable to use it.\"\nVictoria nodded in agreement, she had the same idea.\nSo Victoria and Wendy started arranging the roses.\nWilliam took Alice around the building.\nThe furniture here was all from internationally renowned brands, expensive and exquisite.\nAlice liked a sheepskin sofa, soft and comfortable to touch, with a thick handmade blanket on it, which should be quite warm to lie on.\nBut it was a bit pricey, with a three-seater sofa priced at over a million dollars.\nAlice hesitated upon hearing the price.\n\"William, is this sofa really that expensive?\" she was a bit reluctant.\nWilliam lovingly patted Alice's head and bought it for her with a swipe of his card, smiling at Alice, \"Whatever you like, I'll get it for you.\"\nAlice was moved and threw herself into his arms, complaining, \"William, you're so good to me. When I was in Valados, I lived in shabby apartments.\"\nHearing this, William tightened his arm around her soft waist and said in a deep voice, \"You're the daughter of the Garcia family, and they treated you like that?\"\nAlice nodded, biting her lip, her eyes slightly red, \"I don't blame them. The tuition at Valados is so expensive. It's good enough that they paid for my tuition. As for living expenses, I could earn them by working.\"\n\"You had to work to earn money?\" William frowned, \"Why didn't you tell me?\"\nAlice looked up at him with her watery eyes, pitifully, \"Ella sacrificed so much for me. How could I complain to you behind her back? Besides, I didn't want you to worry about me.\"\nWilliam looked at Alice, suddenly at a loss for words.\nAfter a while, he slowly said, \"If you have any difficulties in the future, you must tell me.\"\nAlice's face lit up with a joyful smile, \"Okay!\"\nAfter chatting for a while, William picked out a few more pieces of furniture she liked, then took her hand and walked towards the door.\nVictoria and Wendy found an empty spot in the hall, laid down a thick carpet, and arranged the roses neatly.\nFinally, they set up a beautiful crystal glass roof over it.\nBathed in warm yellow light, the rose carpet seemed as splendid and fantastical as a dreamland.\n\"So beautiful!\" Wendy exclaimed.\nVictoria liked it too.\nTheir hard work was worth it.\nAs they admired the rose display, someone suddenly shouted, \"Are you Victoria?\"\nVictoria turned her head.\nShe saw a young girl in a pink and purple winter dress, carrying a sheepskin handbag, with light makeup, glaring at her with eyes full of anger.\n\"You know me?\"\nVictoria was puzzled.\nSofia snorted coldly, \"Of course I know you, Victoria. You're the one who seduced my boyfriend!\"\nVictoria frowned, about to say something.\nWendy was furious, \"Who are you, crazy girl? What nonsense are you talking about?\"\n\"Who I am is none of your business, but I can guarantee that Victoria is a flirt who seduces men everywhere!\"\n\"You!\" Wendy was so angry she couldn't speak.\nVictoria stopped the furious Wendy, calmly looking at Sofia, and asked, \"Who are you? If you don't tell me, I'll call the police.\"\n\"You dare ask who I am?\" Sofia pointed at her, \"Because of you, my boyfriend broke up with me.\"",

Stop playing dumb with me!\" Sofia pointed at her angrily, as if she wanted to tear her apart.\nVictoria was speechless, feeling a sense of helplessness.\n\"You misunderstood, I'm not familiar with Alton at all, and I don't like him.\" Victoria patiently explained, \"Your breakup has nothing to do with me.\"\n\"Bullshit!\"\n\"Stop making excuses here!\" Sofia pointed at her and cursed, \"You bitch, do you think I don't know who you are? Your dad designed a bridge that collapsed and killed dozens of people, and you're no better. You're just a slut who steals others' job opportunities by selling yourself, and you even seduce a rich guy who already has a fiancée. You're the worst of the worst, shameless!\"\nThe onlookers were shocked and looked at Victoria in disbelief. They didn't expect such a seemingly innocent girl to have such a messy private life.\nSome even took out their phones to secretly film the scene.\nUpon hearing this, Victoria's deep eyes narrowed, and a cold light flashed.\nShe looked coldly at the aggressive Sofia and questioned in a cold voice, \"Miss, do you have any evidence? If not, don't blame me for suing you for defamation!\"\n\"You!\"\n\"I advise you to leave quickly, or when the security comes, you won't be able to leave even if you want to.\"\n\"I'm not leaving. I must expose you! I want to see what qualifications you have to stay here!\"\nVictoria couldn't be bothered to deal with her.\n\"Wendy, let's go.\" Victoria pulled Wendy and walked around Sofia towards the exit.\nSofia panicked and rushed forward, blocking their way.\nShe pointed at Victoria and shouted, \"Stop! Did I say you could leave?\"\nVictoria frowned and looked at her displeased, asking, \"What do you want now?\"\n\"You must promise me today to cut off all contact with Alton immediately! Otherwise...\" she threatened viciously.\nVictoria couldn't help but laugh bitterly, \"Are you out of your mind? I already told you I'm not familiar with him. Do you not understand human language?\"\n\"You!\" Sofia was furious and raised her hand to slap Victoria.\nBut before she could touch Victoria, Wendy grabbed her wrist and looked at her disdainfully, \"Do you have rabies? Barking and hitting people here! If you're sick, go get treated, don't go crazy outside.\"\nWith that, she pulled Victoria's hand and walked away.\nSofia was trembling with anger. Suddenly, she saw a tiger head ornament nearby, grabbed it without thinking, and threw it at Victoria while screaming, \"You bitch! I'll kill you!\"\nVictoria was caught off guard and hit directly.\nA sharp pain shot through her arm.\n\"Victoria! Are you okay?\" Wendy was terrified.\nSeeing this, Sofia laughed hysterically and even wanted to pick up another tiger head to throw at Victoria.\nSuddenly, a hand grabbed her wrist and twisted it forcefully.\nSofia screamed in pain, feeling as if her entire arm was dislocated. She cried out in pain, tears almost streaming down her face.\n\"You bitch...\"\nVictoria endured the severe pain in her shoulder and looked up to see William with a grim face, throwing Sofia to the ground. \nA crisp sound echoed through the hall.\nWilliam slapped her so hard that half of her face swelled up.\nSofia was stunned.\nVictoria was also stunned.\nWilliam's cold gaze swept over the disheveled Sofia on the ground, then he turned to Victoria and asked in a deep voice, \"Are you okay?\"\nVictoria held her shoulder and shook her head blankly.\nShe couldn't believe William to slap Sofia to defend her, which was beyond her expectations.\nSeeing this, William's expression softened slightly. He helped Victoria sit on the sofa and said gently, \"Sit down and rest for a while.\"\nVictoria was dazed for a moment before she responded softly.\nAt this time, Wendy snapped out of her shock. She quickly approached Victoria and asked concernedly, \"Victoria, how's your injury?\"\nVictoria shook her head, \"It's okay, I'm fine.\"\nSofia got up from the ground, covering her face, and looked hatefully at the cold William who had suddenly appeared and hit her. She cried, \"Are you also this woman's lover? I'm telling you, she's a slut who sleeps around. Don't be fooled by her pitiful appearance!\"\n\"Shut up!\" William scolded, his icy voice filled with murderous intent.\nSofia shivered but still shouted fearlessly, \"Why are you so fierce? Am I wrong? She's a slut, a bitch!\"\nWilliam's eyes turned cold, and he didn't want to waste any more words with her. He directly called the police.\n\"I just hit her once, and you hit me back. It's just a small matter, and you're calling the police? Who are you trying to scare?\" Sofia sneered and then turned to Victoria, \"Alton's family will never accept you someone like you. I advise you to give up early!\"\n\"Have you said enough?\" Wendy couldn't stand it anymore. She grabbed Sofia's hair and shook it hard, \"Do you believe I'll hit you?\"\nSoon, the police arrived.\nAfter investigating the surveillance and testimonies of the people around, Sofia was taken away for causing trouble.\nEverything would be decided after Victoria's injury report came out.\nVictoria wanted to take a cab to the hospital, but William stopped her with a look.\n\"Come with me!\" he ordered coldly.\nVictoria pursed her lips and obediently followed him to the parking lot.\nAlice was already waiting in the car.\nShe sat in the passenger seat and greeted her with a gentle smile, \"Ms. Carter.\"\nVictoria nodded politely, \"Hello, Ms. Garcia.\"\nWilliam glanced at her and sat directly in the driver's seat.\nVictoria hesitated for a moment but eventually sat in the back seat.\nAs soon as the car door closed, a faint fragrance wafted into her nose. Victoria instinctively frowned but didn't show it.\nShe had always been somewhat allergic to perfume. William's car never had a perfume smell before.\nIt must be coming from Alice.\nVictoria lowered her eyes and leaned against the car window, holding her arm and resting.\nThe car drove steadily forward, and Alice and William discussed how to arrange the furniture they had just bought.\nWilliam listened patiently and occasionally offered suggestions.\nSo they were already living together?\nVictoria had never seen him so gentle before, and she couldn't help but feel a bit dazed.\nEven with Ella, William never seemed so gentle and careful.\nIt seemed more like he was performing for the fiancée's title, without much genuine affection.\nBut Victoria could easily see the genuine affection he held for Alice in his eyes-a palpable adoration that betrayed the depth of his feelings.\nTrue love, perhaps, was meant to describe this situation.\nIt was undoubtedly true love.\nVictoria felt a strange bitterness in her heart, but what followed was relief and release.\nHe already had true love, so he would let her go, right?\n\"Ms. Carter, the boy who sent you roses is quite nice. You might want to consider him,\" Alice suddenly joked lightly.",

But now that I'm back, I hope you won't get entangled with her anymore, okay?\"\nWilliam's eyes were deep as the sea, and after a moment, he replied, \"I've already made things clear with her, don't worry.\"\nHearing his words, Alice smiled again, reached out to tug at William's sleeve, and said sweetly, \"I believe William won't lie to me.\"\nWilliam nodded and reached out to ruffle her hair.\nAlice squinted her eyes in satisfaction, her smile sweet.\nWilliam drove her to the restaurant she had been looking forward to.\nDuring the meal, he received a text from his lawyer, asking how he wanted to handle the situation.\nWilliam replied simply and decisively with just a few words: [Let her go to jail.]\nSofia, who hit Victoria, had a father, Lloyd Moore, who was a high-ranking executive at a bank. She had been pampered and spoiled since childhood, which made her arrogant and domineering.\nWho knew she would find a boyfriend who dumped her for a small-time employee.\nSofia couldn't swallow her anger and immediately investigated Victoria's background.\nShe discovered that Victoria had a notorious reputation.\nHer father Alvin was in prison, and she herself had been involved in scandals for allegedly using her body to climb the social ladder.\nThere were even rumors that she had an unclear relationship with a big shot who had a fiancée.\nBeing dumped for someone like that, of course, Sofia was unhappy.\nShe went directly to cause trouble, which led to the current situation.\nIt wasn't until she was locked up in the police station's detention center that she started to get scared.\nShe kept begging the police to let her out.\nHer parents had always doted on Sofia and couldn't bear to see her suffer.\nSo they asked a familiar lawyer to smooth things over at the police station.\nInitially, Sofia's parents thought it was just a petty rivalry between girls, and since Sofia had also been hit, it shouldn't be a big deal. At worst, they would just pay some money.\nBut the lawyer told them that the matter was far-reaching, and there was a big shot involved, making it impossible to bail her out.\nThey panicked and sought help from many people, but to no avail.\nAfter three days of Sofia's detention, they finally found out that the person Sofia had hit was William's woman.\nWhat kind of existence is the Scott family?\nThe top conglomerate in Crystalia, capable of shaking the entire city with a single move.\nLloyd was just an ordinary bank executive and couldn't afford to provoke them.\nSofia's mother, Thalia Moore, cried her eyes out, while Lloyd was worried sick.\nLloyd, who usually looked shrewd, now had gray hair and a troubled expression.\nFinally, their lawyer suggested they seek help from Alton to plead with the victim.\nAs long as the victim agreed, everything would be resolved.\nSince the matter started because of him, and seeing Lloyd and Thalia's sincere pleas, Alton hesitated for a moment and agreed to help, despite his embarrassment at facing Victoria again.\nVictoria then learned that Sofia had been detained for three days.\nAnd no one knew how much longer she would be held.\nIt seemed William wanted her to go to jail.\nShe didn't expect William to care so much about her being hit.\nAlthough the tiger head had indeed swollen her arm, it wasn't serious enough to warrant jail time.\nAfter thinking it over, she decided to call William.\nWilliam was about to drive home when he received her call.\n\"Mr. Scott,\" Victoria's tone was calm.\n\"What is it?\" William asked.\nVictoria hesitated for a moment before saying, \"Sofia has been detained for three days.\"\nThere was silence on the other end of the line for a few seconds.\nWilliam's deep, magnetic voice slowly sounded, \"So?\"\nVictoria bit her lip and hesitated for a moment before saying, \"Mr. Scott, I think it would be better to settle this privately. She's only 19, still a young girl. If she's sentenced, her life could be ruined.\"\nWilliam raised an eyebrow, his tone mocking, \"Are you saying I'm being too harsh?\"\nVictoria was stunned for a moment and quickly denied, \"Of course not, you're standing up for me. I'm not ungrateful. I just think that making a big deal out of this isn't good for either of us, especially since my reputation isn't great to begin with.\"\nAfter listening, William's lips curled into a cold smile, and he scoffed, \"Victoria, you're still so hypocritical.\"\nWith that, he hung up the phone.",

Who would stand up for her then?\nThe more Victoria thought about it, the more humiliated she felt. She buried her head in the pillow, her eyes slightly red.\nAfter a while, she got up from the bed and called Samuel.\nBecause her arm was injured, she couldn't go to the studio to paint with Samuel on Saturday.\nWhen Samuel received her call, he was a bit worried. \"Victoria, are you sick?\"\nVictoria didn't want him to worry, so she chose to hide the truth. \"No, I've just been really busy lately.\"\nSamuel was stunned for a moment, then smiled bitterly. \"Victoria, even after all this time, you still keep your distance from me.\"\nHearing this, Victoria felt a pang in her heart, and her eyes couldn't help but moisten.\nShe sniffed, trying hard to control her emotions. \"I'm fine, just a bit tired lately. I'll be okay after some rest.\"\nSamuel pondered for a moment and then gently advised. \"If you need anything, remember to tell me. There's no need for formalities between us.\"\nVictoria bit her lip and nodded. \"Okay, thank you, Samuel.\"\nAt William's command, Sofia was released.\nThat night, the Moore family called, wanting to bring Sofia to apologize to Victoria in person, and of course, they also invited William to attend.\nLloyd and Thalia were humble and extremely polite.\nVictoria initially refused, but couldn't resist Thalia's persistent persuasion, moved by her motherly love, and finally agreed to attend the dinner.\nAt 7:30 PM, Victoria arrived on time.\nAs she reached the hotel entrance, a black Maybach stopped in front of her.\nThe driver got out and opened the rear door.\nA man in a suit and tie, exuding an air of nobility, stepped out of the car.\nHe looked at Victoria with deep eyes, as if they contained a thousand mountains covered in snow.\nWilliam walked towards her, and their eyes met, both showing complex emotions.\nAfter a long while, William hoarsely called out, \"Victoria.\"\nVictoria sighed lightly and looked away first. \"Mr. Scott.\"\nWilliam glanced at her arm, his eyes darkening. \"How's your arm?\"\nVictoria nodded, lowering her eyes slightly, and said self-deprecatingly. \"I've become a regular at the hospital. This little injury is no big deal.\"\nHearing her say that, William felt a surge of inexplicable anger. \"No big deal? Then what do you consider a big deal?\"\nVictoria was stunned, not understanding why he suddenly got angry, and remained silent.\nWilliam stared at her for a moment, then suddenly sneered. \"I forgot how tough you are, just like how shameless you can be!\"\nAfter saying that, he walked past her and headed into the hotel.\nVictoria stood there for a long time before slowly reacting.\nHe actually called her shameless!\nHow dare he insult her? How dare he?\nVictoria felt a tightness in her chest, a breath of anger stuck in her throat.\nShe clenched her fists, holding back her anger, and caught up with William.\nWhen they opened the door to the private room, the Moore family and Alton all stood up.\nSofia, having been detained for a few days, was much more subdued, but Victoria could tell she was still full of resentment.\nAlton glanced at Victoria with some embarrassment, then lowered his head in fear of William beside her.\nIf he had known she was William's woman, he wouldn't have dared to provoke her.\nLloyd awkwardly smiled. \"Mr. Scott, you're here, please have a seat.\"\nWilliam, with a cold expression, sat down in the center, while Victoria sat to his left.\nOnce everyone was seated, Lloyd eagerly raised his glass to Victoria. \"Ms. Carter, this incident was all because Sofia was young and ignorant...\"\nBefore Victoria could speak, William interrupted Lloyd. \"Young? Victoria is less than a year older than your daughter. Is she not young?\"\nLloyd awkwardly closed his mouth.\nIf he hadn't mentioned it, no one would have thought Victoria was so young.\nBecause she no longer had that youthful naivety, but rather a mature and composed demeanor.\nLloyd carefully continued. \"Sofia has realized her mistake. Ms. Carter, I brought her here today to apologize to you, hoping you can forgive her.\"\nVictoria looked at Sofia, who seemed composed and not at all remorseful.\nShe glanced at her briefly, then turned to Lloyd and calmly replied, \"Mr. Moore, it wasn't you who did it. There's no need for you to apologize to me.\"\nWilliam, amused by her assertiveness, chimed in. \"Exactly, if the person who made the mistake doesn't apologize, then let's just forget it.\"\nSofia slammed the table, her eyes wide with anger, and accused. \"I just hit you once, and you had me detained for so many days. Now you're turning the tables on me. Do you have any sense of reason?\"\n\"What did you say?\" William narrowed his eyes dangerously.\nVictoria placed a hand on his arm, signaling him to stay calm.\nVictoria looked up at Sofia, her clear eyes flashing with cold light. \"It seems Ms. Moore doesn't think she did anything wrong. In that case, there's no need to continue this dinner.\"\n\"You!\" Sofia's face changed, clenching her fists in anger.\nLloyd frowned and quickly tried to smooth things over. \"Ms. Carter, it's a misunderstanding. Sofia didn't mean it that way.\"\nHe sincerely said. \"Ms. Carter, this is all my fault for not educating her properly. Please be magnanimous and let's just forget this ever happened.\"\n\"Dad, why are you begging her? She just wants to extort more money.\" Sofia said indignantly, full of sarcasm, then turned to Victoria, \"Tell me, how much do you want? The Moore family can afford it. Name your price!\"\nVictoria was shocked by Sofia's shamelessness.\nShe had come to this dinner just to get an apology, but Sofia insulted her like this.\nAnd judging by Lloyd and Thalia's expressions, they didn't seem to oppose her actions.\nTo them, she was just here to get compensation.\nVictoria smirked, looking at Sofia with a half-smile. \"Sofia, I'm afraid you can't afford the compensation I want.\"\n\"How much do you want?\" Sofia looked at her disdainfully.\nVictoria curled her lips and slowly said. \"One billion dollars.\"\nSofia burst into laughter, pointing at Victoria with an exaggerated expression. \"Are you crazy? Do you know how much a billion dollars is?\"",

        "content": "Victoria calmly sipped her tea, \"Didn't you say I could name my price? What? Backing out already? If that's the case, then I guess I came here for nothing.\"\nLloyd quickly interjected, \"Ms. Carter, Sofia is still a child and doesn't know any better. Please don't hold it against her.\"\nHe kept signaling Sofia to apologize.\nUnfortunately, Sofia didn't appreciate it and instead directed all her anger at Victoria.\n\"Who 's backing out? You're the one making outrageous demands!\"\nVictoria raised an eyebrow, \"If you can't afford it, that's fine. You don't need to apologize. You injured my arm, so let me hit you until I'm satisfied, and I'll let Mr. Scott drop the matter. How about that?\"\n\"You! You're too much!\" Sofia's eyes turned red, and she started to cry, \"You're bullying me!\"\nVictoria's face remained indifferent, \"My terms are fair.\"\nThalia, seeing Sofia crying in anger, quickly tried to comfort her, \"Sofia, don't cry.\"\nShe turned her head and glared at Victoria, \"Ms. Carter, asking for a hundred million dollars is unreasonable. We're sincerely trying to resolve this matter with you, so there's no need to be so aggressive.\"\nLloyd, despite his fear of William, couldn't help but get a little angry, \"Ms. Carter, as far as I know, you're just a small employee at a gallery, living off your salary, with a sick mother and a brother still in school to support. Name a realistic number, and don't make things difficult.\"\nAlton, seeing the tense atmosphere, wanted to say something in Victoria's defense but chose to remain silent because William was present.\nVictoria chuckled softly, a hint of self-mockery in her eyes.\nIt seemed that, in the eyes of the Moore family, everything she did was just to get more money.\nTo these wealthy people, anything that could be solved with money was not a big issue.\nBut if you wanted to harm their noble bodies, that was a great insult.\nThey never considered that while their bodies could feel pain, so could others'.\nRich people had dignity, and so did poor people.\nVictoria's hand on her knee clenched slightly. She took a deep breath, trying to suppress the anger about to erupt, and said calmly, \"You can't come up with the money, and you don't want me to hurt your precious body, so there's nothing more to say.\"\nWith that, she stood up to leave.\nWilliam grabbed her hand, pressing her back into the chair, and extinguished his cigarette in the ashtray.\nHis eyes were dark, and his voice was cold, \"Do as she says. Let her hit your daughter until she's satisfied.\"\nWilliam's tone was calm, but the underlying menace and ruthlessness were terrifying.\nAs soon as he spoke, the temperature in the restaurant seemed to drop several degrees.\nSofia trembled in fear, almost collapsing to the floor.\nShe stammered, \"No... no way!\"\nThalia panicked, \"Mr. Scott!\"\nWilliam glanced at them mockingly, \"I understand you want to protect your daughter, but I also have to protect my woman. It's either a beating or jail. You choose. I'll give you a day to think about it.\"\nWith that, he took Victoria's hand and walked out of the private room.\nSofia stood there in shock for a moment before rushing to the door, only to be stopped by the bodyguards waiting outside.\n\"Mr. Scott, please listen to me. Give me another chance. I was wrong. I really know I was wrong.\"\nBut William didn't stop, walking straight out.\nVictoria followed beside him, her head down, feeling conflicted.\nLloyd's words echoed in her mind, reminding her of the times Alvin had defended her.\nShe kept her head down, ignoring William's increasingly tight grip on her hand.\nIn the car, the warm air from the air conditioner blew gently. William looked out the window at the passing neon lights, his expression unreadable.\nVictoria pressed her lips together, saying nothing.\nSuddenly, William turned his head, staring at her profile, and asked softly, \"What's wrong?\"\nVictoria's eyelashes fluttered slightly, and she slowly shook her head.\n\"Don't let their crazy talk get to you.\" William's voice was magnetic and low.\nVictoria pressed her lips together, \"Thank you for helping me.\"\nIf it weren't for him, she would have had to swallow the insults and injuries in silence.\nIt seemed he wasn't as bad as she thought.\n\"To hear a 'thank you' from you is quite rare,\" William scoffed.\nVictoria ignored his mockery and continued, \"That Sofia is still young. Just give her a little lesson. Even if she let me hit her, I couldn't do it.\"\nWilliam narrowed his eyes, \"What? Feeling soft-hearted?\"\nVictoria paused, raising her clear, bright eyes to look at him seriously, \"It's not soft-hearted. I just think her parents have it tough.\"\n\"you're kind-hearted but foolish, always letting useless people bully you,\" William said nonchalantly.\nVictoria pressed her lips together and said nothing more.\nWilliam smirked, then leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes to rest.\nAfter a while, Victoria's phone rang.\nShe glanced at the number; it was Samuel calling.\nVictoria looked at William, hesitated for two seconds, and answered the call.\n\"Victoria, my parents are here. They want to invite you to dinner the day after tomorrow. Can you come?\" Samuel warmly invited over the phone.\nVictoria glanced at William, who was resting with his eyes closed, turned her head, and lowered her voice, \"Okay.\"\nAfter hanging up, she looked at William. He still had his eyes closed, showing no reaction. She let out a long breath.\nIt seemed that once Alice returned, he really wouldn't bother her anymore.\nThinking this, she felt much more at ease. A faint smile appeared on her lips as she tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, looking even more gentle and pure.\nWilliam opened his eyes just in time to catch this moment.\nHis heart sank, and even his breathing became difficult.\nWas she that happy to meet Samuel's parents?\nWhat was so good about that old man?\nWhat was she so happy about?\nHe narrowed his eyes, a strange feeling spreading in his heart, tinged with a bit of sourness and helplessness.\nVictoria sensed William's gaze and immediately returned to her usual self.\nWilliam suppressed his emotions, placed his hand on the armrest, and said lightly, \"I just remembered I have something to do at the office. You'll have to take a cab home.\"",

After Victoria got out, the car immediately drove away.\nVictoria stood still, looked up at the pitch-black night sky, sighed deeply, and walked towards the bus stop.\nOn the day she had arranged to meet Samuel, Victoria worked all day despite the pain in her arm.\nSamuel was already waiting for her outside the Starry Studio Gallery in his car.\nShe tidied up her clothes and makeup, then hurried over with her bag.\nToday, Samuel was wearing an off-white suit, his hair neatly combed, making him look both refined and elegant.\nHe opened the car door and got out, walking towards Victoria.\nVictoria was about to greet him when suddenly someone jumped out from the side and grabbed her hand.\nShe was startled and instinctively shook off the person.\nUpon closer inspection, she realized it was Sofia.\n\"Ms. Moore, what do you want now?\" she frowned.\nSamuel frowned slightly and stepped forward, standing protectively beside Victoria.\nSofia's cheeks were red, as if she had been crying, looking pitiful and tearful.\n\"Ms. Carter, I'm here to apologize to you. I'm sorry, I was too impulsive before. I hope you can be forgiving and not hold a grudge against my previous offense.\"\nShe spoke humbly, without a trace of arrogance.\nVictoria frowned, \"What do you mean by this?\"\nSuch a drastic change in attitude in just one day made Victoria worry that Sofia might have some ulterior motive.\nSamuel, standing beside her, remained silent, his usually gentle face now somewhat gloomy, revealing nothing of his thoughts.\nSofia wiped her tears and pulled at her clothes, revealing a bruised shoulder.\n\"Ms. Carter, this was done by Mr. Scott's men.\"\n\"Are you here to settle scores with me?\" Victoria raised an eyebrow.\n\"No, I'm here to apologize.\" She bit her lip, forcing a smile, \"I was blinded by jealousy before and did something foolish. Now I've come to my senses and want to apologize to you in person.\"\nAs she spoke, she bowed deeply.\nVictoria was slightly stunned by her actions.\nSuch behavior didn't seem like an act of revenge.\nBut she didn't believe Sofia's words and remained cautious, \"Ms. Moore, I don't care what your intentions are today, but I advise you not to have any bad ideas!\"\n\"I really know I was wrong!\" Sofia said urgently.\nHer attitude was sincere, her eyes red, looking extremely aggrieved. \"I heard from my father that Mr. Scott originally intended to have me imprisoned for a year and a half. Fortunately, Ms. Carter, you didn't hold a grudge, and Mr. Scott showed mercy and released me early!\"\nAfter speaking, she bowed again, this time genuinely.\nVictoria was very surprised.\nShe didn't expect William to reveal her plea to the Moore family.\nThis not only vented her anger but also made the Moore family owe her a favor.\n\"Ms. Carter, you saved my life. Without you, I would have been ruined forever.\"\nShe choked and sobbed.\nVictoria pursed her lips, glanced at Sofia, and then looked away, \"I've received your apology. Let's leave it at that.\"\nWith that, she signaled to Samuel, who was waiting nearby, and prepared to get in the car and leave.\nSofia grabbed her again and handed her a card, \"Ms. Carter, there's $200,000 in here. It's not much, but it's a token of my appreciation.\"\nVictoria glanced at the bank card but didn't take it, \"You've been hurt and apologized to me. We're even. Keep the money.\"\n\"No, no, this is my token of appreciation! Please, you must accept it!\" Sofia held her hand tightly, her eyes red.\nVictoria was about to refuse when Samuel suddenly spoke up, \"Victoria, accept it. If you don't, she probably won't be at ease.\"\nSamuel emphasized \"at ease,\" and Sofia immediately echoed, \"Ms. Carter, please accept it!\"\nVictoria hesitated for a few seconds before finally agreeing, \"Alright, I'll accept it.\"\nSofia was overjoyed, \"Thank you, Ms. Carter!\"\nAfter sending Sofia away, Victoria got into the car.\nSamuel hadn't spoken since getting in.\nVictoria had never seen him so serious before. She pursed her lips and tentatively called out, \"Samuel?\"\nSamuel turned his head, his gaze falling on her slightly pale face.\nAfter a moment, he spoke slowly, \"Victoria, you told me before that you couldn't come to paint because your arm was injured by that girl, right?\"\nVictoria was stunned for a few seconds before quickly coming to her senses.\nShe nodded, \"Yes.\"\n\"I should have guessed.\" He murmured, a hint of helplessness in his eyes.\nEven after all this time, Victoria still hadn't thought of relying on him.\nShe could accept William's money and help, but she wouldn't owe him anything.\nShe said she didn't want to trouble him, but in reality, she was just keeping her distance.\nEven someone as confident as Samuel felt a sense of defeat at this moment.\n\"Victoria, I actually mind a little.\" He looked out the window, his tone serious, \"In the future, learn to rely on me, okay?\"\nVictoria's body trembled, and she turned to look at him.\nHis handsome and refined face was full of gentleness and care.\nHe asked her to learn to rely on me in the future.\nA faint smile appeared on her lips, but her eyes glistened with tears, \"Okay.\"\nSamuel smiled, \"Good girl.\"\nAs he spoke, he patted her head, \"I know what you're worried about. Don't be afraid. With me here, no one can bully you.\"\nVictoria's nose tingled, and she softly called out, \"Samuel.\"\nHer voice was hoarse and indistinct, as if filled with a thick nasal tone.\nSamuel just patted her back and didn't say anything more.\nThe car fell silent, with only the sound of the engine running.\nThe car stopped at an estate.\nThis was the largest garden-themed restaurant in Silvermist City, called 'Aroma Garden Eatery.'\nVictoria sat nervously across from Samuel's parents, feeling anxious.\nShe couldn't help but wonder what they would think of her.\n\"Dad, Mom, this is Victoria,\" Samuel introduced.\nVictoria quickly stood up and respectfully said, \"Mr. Brown, Mrs. Brown, nice to meet you.\"\nSamuel's mother, Primrose Brown, looked Victoria up and down, nodding in satisfaction.\nOther families already had grandchildren, but Samuel, almost thirty, showed no signs of getting married or even having a girlfriend.\nTalking to him was useless; he had been independent since childhood and wouldn't let anyone interfere. \nAlthough Victoria's family background and education weren't impressive, she was beautiful and young. They could teach and nurture her slowly.\nIf they missed this opportunity, they might never find someone Samuel liked, and he would end up alone.\nThinking this, Primrose's face was full of smiles, \"Sit here, let's not be formal.\"\nPrimrose warmly invited Victoria to sit and asked the waiter to bring the menu.\n\"Victoria, order whatever you like. Don't be shy.\"\nVictoria felt a bit uneasy and quickly declined, \"Mrs. Brown, you're too kind.\"\nSeeing Victoria's discomfort, Samuel took the menu and ordered some of their favorite dishes.\nThe atmosphere at the table became lively.\nVictoria was a bit overwhelmed. She hadn't expected Primrose to be so easygoing and to like her so much.\nDuring the meal, Primrose kept serving her food, and Samuel's father, Elmer Brown, though not very talkative, was also very kind.\nThey treated her as if she were already their daughter-in-law.\nThey even discussed whether to live in Prosperity City or Silvermist City in the future.\nThis made Victoria very uncomfortable.\nShe explained that she and Samuel were not yet in a relationship, \"Mr. Brown, Mrs. Brown, actually, Samuel and I...\"",

She didn't know why William was here today.\nCould it be that he heard her phone call with Samuel that day and came here specifically to confront her?\nHer body trembled slightly, and just as she was about to say something, Samuel's hand suddenly held hers.\nVictoria didn't want to overthink it, but the facts were right in front of her, and she couldn't help but think that way.\nVictoria was startled and looked up, meeting Samuel's clear eyes.\nHe smiled at her, as if to reassure her, and then turned to William. \"Thank you, Mr. Scott. Is this your girlfriend? She's very beautiful!\"\nAlice, who was holding William's arm, glanced at Victoria and tightened her grip a bit, seemingly shy as she replied softly, \"Thank you for the compliment!\"\n\"So you know each other!\" Elmer was surprised.\nSamuel nodded calmly. \"We've met a few times.\"\nWilliam's deep eyes darkened slightly at his words.\n\"Since you know each other, why not join us for a meal?\" Elmer invited warmly.\nWilliam smiled. \"Thank you, Mr. Brown, but I'm afraid someone might feel uncomfortable. We won't disturb your 'family meal'!\"\nWith that, he took Alice's hand and left the private room.\nElmer looked at the door, frowning. \"Why do I feel like he's a bit unhappy?\"\nSamuel pondered for a moment and then said, \"Maybe it's because his girlfriend is here.\"\nPrimrose nodded. \"Indeed.\"\nVictoria breathed a sigh of relief.\nBut she couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't over.\nAfter William left, the atmosphere gradually returned to its previous liveliness. Primrose chatted with Victoria, asking about many interesting things in her daily life.\nVictoria answered each question humbly, and the more Primrose looked at her, the more she liked her, becoming increasingly enthusiastic.\nVictoria felt a bit overwhelmed and stood up, wanting to go to the restroom to take a break.\nSamuel noticed her discomfort and smiled at her, not insisting on following her, giving her some time to relax.\nAroma Garden Eatery was quite large, and Victoria couldn't find the restroom after looking around.\nInstead, she ended up in the flower room where the restaurant kept fresh flowers.\nThe decor inside was elegant, with walls covered in various flowers, emitting a faint fragrance.\nVictoria was allergic to perfume but had no resistance to natural flowers.\nThe roses Alton sent last time probably had perfume sprayed on them, which made her sneeze.\nShe couldn't help but walk closer to the flowers, reaching out to pick a pink rose and bringing it to her nose to sniff. The sweet fragrance lingered, making her feel inexplicably relaxed.\nShe put the rose back and was about to leave.\nBut then she saw William standing by the flower room, smoking. His handsome profile was shrouded in a hazy light, mysterious and sexy.\nHe looked up inadvertently, and their eyes met. Victoria quickly looked away, feeling guilty.\nVictoria didn't dare to stay any longer and hurriedly tried to leave.\nWilliam extinguished his cigarette and strode over, blocking her path.\nVictoria took two steps back in fright, staring at him warily. \"What are you doing?\"\n\"Are you avoiding me?\" William raised an eyebrow.\nVictoria pressed her lips together, ignoring him and continuing to walk forward.\nWilliam grabbed her wrist and pulled her into the flower room, locking the door behind them.\n\"Let go!\" Victoria struggled.\nWilliam pinned her against the wall, looking down at her with dangerous eyes. \"Are you avoiding me?\"\nVictoria gritted her teeth and stubbornly raised her head. \"No.\"\n\"No?\" William sneered, pressing her. \"Then why are you so flustered?\"\nVictoria was speechless.\nYes, why was she flustered? He already had Alice, so she had no reason to worry about him entangling with her.\nSeeing her silence, William's tone became severe. \"Tell me!\"\nVictoria bit her lip, refusing to speak.\nWilliam's eyes darkened. \"Victoria, don't tell me you're avoiding me because you're afraid Samuel will misunderstand?\"\nVictoria was stunned. She did want to avoid him, but not because of Samuel.\n\"Think whatever you want!\" Victoria said, turning to leave.\nWilliam grabbed her waist and pulled her into his arms, his lips landing on her neck, biting hard.\nVictoria groaned.\nShe could clearly smell the strong scent of alcohol on William.\n\"Let go!\" Victoria elbowed his abdomen, trying to break free, but it was futile.\nShe had to resort to using her legs to attack him.\nBut before her leg could touch him, William pinned her down. His other hand covered her breast, kneading through the soft sweater.\nVictoria trembled all over.\nShe was both anxious and angry. \"Bastard, let go of me!\"\n\"You better pray I don't find out you have any intimate relationship with Samuel,\" William's hoarse voice sounded.\nHis fingers lingered on her chest, seemingly wanting to go further.\nVictoria's eyes widened in horror, and she shook her head desperately. \"No!\"\nWilliam put a finger to his lips, whispering, \"Shut up, and don't move, or else...\"\nBefore he finished speaking, he kissed her lips.\nHis warm tongue invaded her mouth, taking in her scent, dominating her territory, and savoring her sweetness.\nVictoria felt like she was floating, her thoughts lost in William's fiery breath.\nHis lips were cool and moist, like poppies blooming on a rainy night.\nHe kissed her, his hand wandering over her body, teasing her.\nAfter what felt like an eternity, William finally reluctantly left her lips, resting his forehead against hers, whispering, \"Good girl.\"\nHis warm breath tickled her ear, making her body tingle and a strange sense of unfamiliarity rise within her.\nVictoria could clearly feel his swollen erection pressing against her, the scorching heat transmitting through their clothes to her skin, making her whole body stiffen.\n\"Alice is still waiting for you,\" Victoria reminded him softly.",

I've been looking for him for a while,\" Alice asked, pretending to be calm.\nVictoria cleared her throat and said softly, \"I don't know. I just came out of the restroom and didn't see him.\"\nAlice's eyes flickered, and she smiled, \"If you didn't see him, then we must have missed each other.\"\nVictoria nodded, said nothing more, and prepared to leave.\nAlice called out to her, \"By the way, my friend's bar is opening in a few days, and she wants me to bring some people to support her. I'm having trouble finding someone suitable. Why don't you come along? I promise to get you home safely after that, okay?\"\nAlice's words were accompanied by a gentle smile and a polite tone, making it hard to refuse.\nVictoria hesitated for a moment but decided to decline.\nShe really didn't want to get involved with them any further.\n\"Sorry, I don't like lively places,\" Victoria replied tactfully.\n\"But I've already told Daisy you would come, and she was very happy. Are you sure you won't go? She would be very disappointed,\" Alice feigned disappointment.\nHearing this, Victoria hesitated.\nDaisy had taken her to the hospital last time, and she hadn't thanked her yet.\n\"Since that's the case, I'll go,\" Victoria said.\nAlice breathed a sigh of relief and smiled brightly, \"Then it's settled. I'll send the address to your phone later, and I'll have a driver pick you up.\"\nAfter saying this, Alice walked towards her seat.\nElmer and Primrose were very pleased with Victoria and even gave her a delicate jewelry box containing a beautiful diamond necklace when they left.\nThe necklace was a limited edition and very expensive.\n\"Ms. Carter, I had this specially designed for you. It will look beautiful on you.\"\n\"Thank you so much, but it's too valuable. I can't accept it,\" Victoria declined.\nPrimrose took her hand and said, \"We are elders, and you can't refuse a gift from us. Take it!\"\nVictoria couldn't refuse Elmer and Primrose, so she looked at Samuel for help, hoping he would persuade them.\nSamuel smiled and said, \"Take it. If you don't accept my mom's choice, she will be unhappy.\"\nVictoria had no choice but to accept the jewelry box.\nAt this moment, William also came out with Alice, seemingly not seeing them, and left through another exit.\nBut Victoria felt that his parting glance carried a chill, making her shiver.\nAlice, holding William's arm, asked softly, \"William, are we going home now?\"\nWilliam saw Samuel's car leave through the window and said in a hoarse voice, \"I'll take you home first. I have something to do.\"\nAlice's heart sank, and she quickly asked, \"What is it?\"\n\"Just some work matters to handle. Don't worry, it's nothing major,\" William said perfunctorily.\nAlthough Alice was unwilling, she agreed, \"Alright then.\"\nOn the way home, Samuel noticed Victoria's low spirits and asked, \"Victoria, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?\"\nVictoria tightly held the expensive box in her hand and sighed, \"Samuel, I can't accept this necklace.\"\n\"Don't you like it?\" Samuel was a bit surprised.\nVictoria shook her head and said bitterly, \"Actually, I shouldn't have come to dinner with your parents today.\"\nSamuel's grip on the steering wheel tightened, and he forced a smile, \"Why do you say that?\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes, hiding the sadness and disappointment in them, and said softly, \"Samuel, you're too good. We're not suitable.\"\nSamuel's face changed suddenly after hearing Victoria's words, \"Victoria, is it that we're not suitable, or you don't have feelings for me?\"\nVictoria paused and said slowly, \"It's that I'm not worthy.\"\nSamuel was the only person in this world, besides Alvin, who had given her warmth and care.\nShe had thought that with Alice back, William wouldn't bother her anymore.\nShe genuinely wanted to develop a relationship with Samuel and have a good outcome.\nThat's why she agreed to meet Elmer and Primrose with Samuel.\nBut today's kiss with William in the greenhouse made her realize that William wouldn't let her go easily.\nShe couldn't be entangled with William while openly enjoying Samuel's kindness.\nSuch behavior was too greedy and dirty.\nSamuel suddenly braked sharply, the tires screeching against the ground, startling Victoria.\n\"Victoria, I just want to ask you, do you hate me?\" Samuel turned to look into Victoria's eyes and asked seriously.\nVictoria looked at Samuel's handsome and gentle face, her eyes slightly red, and said softly, \"Samuel, how could I hate you?\"\nSamuel smiled, \"If you don't hate me, it means you still have feelings for me, right?\"",

Otherwise, I don't know what I might do!\"\nThe threat in his words was even stronger than before, making her shiver uncontrollably.\nWith a soft click, she turned on the room's light.\nTaking a deep breath, she walked heavily towards the living room.\nWilliam sat on the sofa, legs crossed, lazily leaning back, a cigarette between his long fingers, the red ember flickering.\nHe looked up at Victoria, his deep pupils narrowing, his thin lips pressed into a straight line.\nVictoria felt a chill run down her spine under William's gaze. She swallowed and tentatively asked, \"Mr. Scott, what do you want from me?\"\nWilliam flicked the ash from his cigarette, squinting his eyes and looking at her with a half-smile, \"What, did I interrupt your intimate moment with Professor Brown?\"\nHearing \"intimate,\" Victoria's face changed instantly, \"You saw it.\"\nHer trembling voice betrayed her inner fear.\nWilliam blew out a smoke ring, casually saying, \"Are you referring to the hug or the kiss on the forehead?\"\nVictoria didn't answer; she didn't know what to say at this moment.\nShe only knew that William's calm tone contained a lot of anger.\nWilliam sneered, stood up, and walked over to Victoria, looking down at her.\nVictoria looked up at William in panic.\nWilliam reached out and pinched her sharp chin, shaking it slightly.\n\"I never expected that you, with this pretty and innocent face, is so good at seducing men in private!\"\nVictoria's chin hurt from his grip, and she frowned, \"Let go of me.\"\nWilliam's eyes grew sharper, staring at Victoria without saying a word, but the atmosphere around them grew colder.\nVictoria felt like she was being stared at by a venomous snake, her whole body covered in goosebumps.\n\"William, please let go, my chin hurts,\" Victoria's voice was soft and weak.\nWilliam looked at her pale face and suddenly laughed, \"Victoria, you're always so good at looking pitiful, but...\"\nHe suddenly picked Victoria up, sneering, \"But I just fall for it.\"\nVictoria struggled, pushing against William, but she was no match for the 6'1\" William and was eventually carried into the bedroom.\nVictoria was thrown onto the bed, her body hitting the mattress, making her groan in pain.\nWilliam took off his suit jacket and threw it on the carpet. He pulled at his tie, walking towards Victoria on the bed.\nHe leaned over, trapping her in his arms, \"You know, I wanted to do this in the greenhouse!\"\nVictoria watched as William tied her hands with his tie, panicking, \"William, what are you doing!\"\nWilliam lifted Victoria's chin, whispering in her ear, \"Making love to you!\"\n\"No!\" Victoria struggled desperately, \"William, you can't do this to me, let me go!\"\nWilliam's lips curled into a wicked smile, pulling her up from the bed, \"Victoria, I've spoiled you too much lately. You forgot I warned you before, my patience is limited. I'm giving you a chance now, be obedient.\"\nHis voice was ambiguous and provocative.\nVictoria shook her head, her eyes filled with humiliation and fear, her eyes red as she stared at him, \"William, please.\"\nHer pleading look only fueled William's desire to conquer.\nHe leaned down, forcefully prying open her teeth, gently entangling her tongue, savoring her.\nVictoria resisted fiercely.\nWilliam held her waist with one hand and her head with the other, sucking her lips hard.\nVictoria was kissed until she was dizzy, her brain deprived of oxygen, struggling to breathe.\nHe pressed her against the headboard, his eyes red.\nVictoria panted, her chest heaving violently, her eyes tightly closed, her eyelashes trembling.\nSeeing her shy appearance, William felt his desire flared up. A strange agitation washed over his nerves, making him want to tear her apart immediately.\nHe propped himself up on the bed, leaning down to kiss Victoria's lips again, while his right hand slipped under her clothes.\nTouching her soft, slender waist, a part of his body ached with desire.\nThis Victoria always easily aroused his lust.\nVictoria's hands were tied with the tie, unable to move, only able to let him do as he pleased.\nWilliam's actions were rough and wild, lifting her skirt halfway, revealing her round buttocks.\nHer skin was smooth and delicate, like a porcelain doll, inviting caresses.\nWilliam's hand climbed up her skirt, covering her full breasts.\nVictoria was made to feel numb all over, a heat rising in her lower abdomen. She couldn't help but clench her long, straight legs, biting her lip to suppress her moans.\nVictoria's soft moans stimulated his senses.\nHis large hand slowly moved up along the groove.\nVictoria's body grew hotter, her head tilted back, enduring the pleasure.\nAn indescribable sense of joy rose within her, making her intoxicated and scared.\nAll this wonderful feeling came from William.\nHe was like a poppy, making her addicted.\n\"William!\" Victoria called out, her eyes filled with tears, looking incredibly seductive.",

        "content": "William's Adam's apple bobbed as he growled and thrust forcefully into Victoria, entering her without any hindrance, riding her wildly.\nThis feeling was unfamiliar yet thrilling. Victoria squirmed restlessly, her bound hands clawing at the sheets, her entire body becoming extremely sensitive in this position.\nVictoria's reaction pleased William. As he took her, he whispered in her ear, \"You're so tight!\"\nVictoria couldn't help but moan out loud.\nWilliam's large hand moved to the back of her head, pressing her shoulder, forcing her to meet his thrusts.\nHe kissed Victoria's neck while breathing heavily.\n\"William!\" Victoria called out his name, her body filled by him.\nWilliam's breathing grew heavier.\nHis hands lifted her hips, thrusting into her forcefully again and again.\nVictoria's eyes were wet; she gritted her teeth to endure, but couldn't resist the pleasure and joy he brought her.\nHer arms clung tightly around his neck, her cheeks flushed, her eyes misty, her mouth letting out broken moans, each one making William move faster.\nWilliam flipped Victoria over, making her back rest against the headboard, her hips raised high. He thrust again, the deep and shallow rhythm merging their bodies into one.\nHe pounded into her body repeatedly. Victoria had long lost control, helplessly moaning, crying out, \"William, William!\"\n\"Victoria, you're mine!\" William whispered in her ear, crashing into her in waves.\nHer body convulsed from the impact, almost falling apart. Her arms gripped the headboard tightly, her lips slightly parted, letting out whimpering moans.\nWilliam's eyes were bloodshot, the beast within him awakened by her. He kept attacking, withdrawing, and entering again.\nSince their last encounter in the car by the river, he hadn't relieved himself for a long time.\nEven though Alice lived in the room next to his, he never felt any sexual desire for her.\nHe just wanted to cherish her.\nUnlike Victoria, just looking at her could ignite his inner desire.\nVictoria's forehead was beaded with sweat, her face flushed, her body trembling violently with each thrust. Her tense legs gradually bent under William's powerful thrusts.\nHer delicate toes curled tightly, her body trembling uncontrollably.\nShe looked especially alluring like this.\n\"Victoria, call me, I want to hear you call my name.\" William said, thrusting again, making Victoria's body convulse.\nHe lifted her legs, placing them on his shoulders, thrusting forcefully. Victoria screamed sharply, her body shivering, tears in her eyes as she looked at William, her body trembling continuously.\n\"William!\" Victoria cried out his name.\nWilliam's eyes lit up instantly, and his semen uncontrollably spurting out.\nVictoria was also sent to the peak, collapsing on the bed, exhausted.\nWilliam didn't withdraw immediately, staying inside Victoria.\nHe placed her bound hands around his neck, then carried her into a bathtub filled with warm water.\nVictoria leaned tiredly against William, slowly opening her eyes.\nWilliam held her hip with one hand, taking the shower gel with the other, applying it to her body.\n\"Don't move!\" His hoarse voice carried a hint of laziness.\nVictoria's body was soft and tender, he had just tested it. Her skin was smoother than milk.\nHis fingers glided over her delicate skin, he loved the feeling of touching her.\nVictoria's body couldn't help but tremble, even his light touch could evoke different emotions in her.\n\"Victoria, your body is indeed sensitive.\" He whispered ambiguously, deliberately sliding his hand between her legs, guiding her to feel his presence.\nVictoria's body grew stiffer.\nWilliam knew she was sensitive, and he deliberately rubbed his penis against Victoria, slowly pushing it in a bit. Victoria couldn't help but moan softly.\nHaving relieved himself once, he was no longer as rough and wild as before, but very gentle.\nVictoria moaned softly, \"William!\"\nWilliam adjusted her to sit properly, his hands threading through her smooth hair.\n\"Victoria, be good.\" He coaxed softly in her ear.\nVictoria nodded, obediently cooperating with his movements. Despite their intimate actions, Victoria didn't feel any resistance.\nWilliam looked at her obedient expression, unable to help but smile.\nHe thrust heavily into her, enjoying their connection, whispering in her ear, \"Do you like it?\"\nVictoria was too shy to nod, her eyes filled with emotion, her demeanor seductive.\nHer body kept moving, growing increasingly empty and unbearable. She couldn't help but sigh softly, \"William!\"\nHer voice excited him even more, unable to hold back, he thrust heavily a few more times, then withdrew.\nVictoria's panting grew more obvious, her hands clinging to William's broad back, a shy and inviting look on her face.\nWilliam found it irresistible, thrusting into her again.\nIt wasn't until late at night that William finally let her go.\nVictoria was extremely tired, sleeping deeply, motionless, her body pressed tightly against his chest, their hearts close, exchanging heartbeats.\nWilliam watched her for a moment, then leaned down to kiss the corner of her mouth, wiping her clean.\nHe held her, lying on the bed, quietly watching her.\nAfter a long time, he dressed himself and left, closing the door behind him.\nVictoria heard the door close, gently opening her eyes.\nShe stared at the ceiling, her heart filled with mixed emotions.\nAfter a long time, she closed her eyes, a bitter smile forming at the corner of her mouth.\nThe main interior design and layout of the home goods department store building was complete. On the opening day, Victoria and her colleagues from Starry Studio Gallery were busy all day.\nWhen Victoria finally had a moment to check her phone, she found several missed calls from Elara.\nVictoria immediately called Elara back.\n\"Victoria, why couldn't I reach you earlier?\" Elara asked anxiously.\n\"Elara, I was busy with work. What's wrong?\" Victoria asked, puzzled.\n\"I saw Bobby opening the door to your house earlier. Since he's your brother, I didn't stop him. I tried calling you, but couldn't get through.\" Elara said worriedly.\nBobby?\nVictoria felt a pang of unease.\nWhy did Bobby have her house key?\nWhat was he doing at her place?\n\"Victoria?\" Elara called out, concerned.\nVictoria quickly calmed herself, reassuring, \"Elara, don't worry about him. I'll head home right away.\"",

        "content": "After hanging up the phone, Victoria immediately packed her things and went home.\nThe department store was quite remote, and it was an hour later by the time Victoria got home.\nElara was waiting outside the apartment building. When she saw Victoria return, she immediately came up to her.\n\"Victoria, why are you just getting back? Bobby has already left, and I couldn't stop him,\" Elara said anxiously.\nVictoria frowned, \"Left? Did he take anything with him?\"\n\"He seemed to have taken a few paintings. I tried to stop him, but he's strong and fast,\" Elara said helplessly.\n\"Paintings?\" Victoria was shocked. Without saying another word to Elara, she hurried upstairs.\nVictoria opened the door and saw the place in disarray, with drawers and cabinets rummaged through.\nPaintings were scattered all over the floor.\nVictoria quickly picked up all the paintings and carefully checked them, finding that several of her better works from the past six months were missing.\nMore importantly, Bobby had taken the painting she was going to enter into the art association competition!\nVictoria could hardly believe that Bobby would do something so despicable!\nShe felt a surge of anger, her chest tight and her vision darkening, almost fainting on the spot.\nElara was frightened and quickly ran over to support Victoria, \"Victoria, are you okay?\"\nVictoria steadied her emotions and shook her head, \"Elara, I'm fine.\"\nVictoria clenched her fists in anger. Bobby had come to steal her paintings again, and she couldn't let this go!\nVictoria took out her phone and called Bobby.\nBut after several attempts, he didn't answer.\nVictoria decided not to waste any more time. She told Elara and then turned to head to the apartment Nora had bought for Bobby.\nShe had to find Bobby and ask him where he had taken her paintings.\nVictoria arrived at the apartment door and rang the doorbell, but Bobby didn't answer.\nShe rang the doorbell several more times.\nStill no response. Victoria angrily kicked the door several times before turning to head to Nora's hospital room.\nNora was sitting on the bed eating when she saw Victoria come in. Her expression changed slightly, \"Victoria, you're here?\"\nVictoria glared coldly at Nora, \"Tell me, where did Bobby take my paintings?\"\nNora feigned ignorance, \"I don't understand what you're talking about.\"\nVictoria sneered, \"Mom, don't play dumb with me. Bobby went to my house to steal my paintings! Where did he get the key? Wasn't it the one I gave you?\"\nNora's face immediately darkened, \"Victoria, are you crazy? What key and paintings? I don't know what you're talking about!\"\n\"You know exactly what I'm talking about. I'm warning you, if you don't return my paintings, I'll call the police,\" Victoria threatened coldly.\n\"Victoria, I raised you for twenty years, and this is how you repay me? Do you have any conscience?\" Nora angrily accused Victoria.\nVictoria smirked disdainfully, her tone icy, \"You raised me for twenty years? Dad earned the money, and the maid took care of me. What did you do for me? Beat me, scold me, and use me as a stepping stone for your precious son? I don't understand why you did all this. You don't like me, you despise me, so why did you give birth to me? Do you not know who painted the works Bobby won awards for?\"\nNora's face turned pale, her eyes glaring venomously at Victoria, \"What nonsense are you talking about! Of course, Bobby painted those himself.\"\nVictoria laughed mockingly. She should have known that no matter what, Nora would always side with Bobby.\nVictoria couldn't be bothered with her. She took out her phone and prepared to call the police.\n\"What are you doing?\" Nora immediately reached out to grab Victoria's phone.\nVictoria couldn't dodge in time, and the phone was smashed to the ground, the screen shattering.\nVictoria looked at the broken phone for a moment, then coldly stared at Nora, \"I'm telling you, don't think you can use me anymore! I'm no longer your puppet to manipulate!\"\n\"Victoria!\" Nora shouted angrily, \"It's just a painting. Do you have to make such a fuss and disrupt the family?\"\nVictoria coldly stared at Nora, \"Mom, I'll throw those words right back at your precious son.\"\nNora suddenly raised her hand and slapped Victoria hard. She shouted angrily, \"You ungrateful girl, you dare defy me!\"\nAs soon as she finished that, she slapped Victoria again.\nCaught off guard, Victoria was slapped on both cheeks, which immediately swelled and bled at the corners of her mouth.\nShe held her painful cheeks, staring at Nora with a deep sense of grievance.\nNora looked at the red handprints on Victoria's face, a flicker of guilt in her eyes, but it quickly disappeared.\nShe coldly said, \"Those slaps are to teach you to respect your elders. Do you think you can flaunt yourself just because you've seduced a few rich and powerful men?\"\nVictoria stared at Nora, her shoulders trembling, tears welling up but refusing to fall.\nShe coldly said, \"You're my mom, so I'll endure those slaps. But I have no obligation to Bobby. Even if you broke my phone, I can still go to the police. I have witnesses and surveillance footage. I don't believe he can get away.\"\nNora's face twisted with rage, \"You dare!\"\nVictoria fearlessly met Nora's gaze, \"I dare because I owe you nothing, and I owe Bobby nothing. Why wouldn't I dare?\"\nNora was furious. She raised her hand to slap Victoria again.\nThis time, Victoria quickly grabbed Nora's arm and pushed her onto the bed.\n\"How dare you!\" Nora screamed hysterically, her eyes filled with hatred.\nVictoria glanced at the furious Nora and coldly laughed, \"How dare I? When you and Bobby bullied me, did you think about how dare you? Today, I'm daring. What can you do about it?\"\n\"Victoria, you dare treat me like this?\" Nora trembled with rage, her face contorted, \"If you dare go to the police, I'll post all your scandals with William online and let everyone see how shameless Joshua's student is!\"\nNora was completely desperate. She wouldn't allow Victoria to harm Bobby!\n\"You! You!\" Victoria trembled with anger.\nNora pressed on, \"If you dare report it, we'll both go down!\"",

I've always had a habit of recording my work on Instagram. If Bobby doesn't return the painting to me, I'll expose that he stole my work to enter the competition. Let's see if he can ever make it in the art world again.\"\nNora shouted furiously, \"Victoria, you're despicable!\"\n\"Despicable? I'm nothing compared to your precious son, who steals as if it's second nature,\" Victoria retorted sarcastically. \"Didn't you say you wanted to go down together? Fine, you expose me for seducing men, and I'll expose your son for stealing my work. Neither of us will come out unscathed.\"\nNora was speechless, glaring at Victoria with gritted teeth, \"What will it take for you to let Bobby go?\"\nVictoria sneered, \"Unless Bobby kneels before me, admits his mistake, and returns the painting, I won't let this go!\"\n\"You, you're delusional!\" Nora was furious, her face turning red.\nVictoria sneered, \"In that case, let's go down together.\"\nNora gritted her teeth in anger, \"Victoria, don't push me!\"\n\"You pushed me first,\" Victoria said firmly, leaving no room for argument.\nNora trembled with rage, \"Fine, fine. You're ruthless!\"\nVictoria no longer wanted to waste words with her and turned to leave, heading to the police station to report the incident.\nAs she stepped out of the hospital room, Nora suddenly shouted, \"Wait!\"\nVictoria stopped and turned to look at her.\nNora stared at her without blinking, then suddenly bent her knees and knelt before Victoria.\n\"Mom!\" Victoria's pupils contracted in shock, unable to believe what she was seeing.\nShe rushed over to help her up.\nNora was sobbing uncontrollably, choking out, \"Victoria, I'm begging you, please spare Bobby! The teacher from the training team at the University of Aesthetics Shine said his technique is fine but his expressiveness is lacking. If he wants to get into the training team, he needs to submit a decent piece.\"\nShe continued, tears streaming down her face, \"Please help him this one last time. If he can get into the University of Aesthetics Shine, I'll do anything you ask.\"\nVictoria stared blankly at Nora.\nShe never expected Nora to kneel before her for Bobby.\nWhere did that leave her, as her daughter?\nNora wiped her tears and continued to plead, \"I know I've wronged you in the past. You're a forgiving person, please help him this one last time. I promise I won't trouble you again.\"\nVictoria's fists clenched at her sides, her nails digging into her palms, leaving five clear marks.\nShe closed her eyes, forcing back her tears.\nAfter a long while, she opened her eyes, her expression indifferent, and said, \"Mom, this is the last time I'll help him. From now on, we won't interfere with each other. I hope you keep your promise and don't trouble me again.\"\nHer voice was light, as if it could dissipate at any moment.\nNora's face lit up with joy, and she quickly agreed.\nShe had originally thought Victoria would make a big fuss. But to her surprise, as soon as she knelt down, Victoria backed down. She was secretly relieved that she knew how to be both flexible and resilient.\nVictoria gave her one last deep look before turning and quickly leaving the hospital room.\nShe feared that if she delayed any longer, she would break down and cry in front of Nora, questioning why she treated her this way. \nAfter all, she was her biological daughter.\nBut Victoria knew that even if she cried herself to death in front of Nora, she wouldn't be moved in the slightest.\nVictoria had never understood so deeply as she did now that Nora didn't love her, not one bit.\nShe was just a pawn to be used and discarded at will.\nVictoria walked slowly on her way home, unable to hold back her tears any longer. She covered her face and squatted by the roadside, sobbing uncontrollably.\nPassersby stopped to watch, but Victoria seemed oblivious.\nWhen she was too tired to cry, she sat on the steps by the roadside, letting the wind blow through her disheveled hair.\nAfter a long time, she composed herself, took out her phone with the broken screen, and dialed Samuel's number.\nThe phone rang for a while before it was answered, and a familiar, deep, and sexy voice came through, gently asking, \"Victoria, what's wrong?\"\nVictoria sniffled, her voice hoarse, and asked softly, \"Samuel, I can't participate in the art association's competition.\"\nThere was a few seconds of silence on the other end before Samuel's warm voice came through, \"Can you tell me why?\"\nVictoria hesitated for a moment before slowly explaining the situation to him.\n\"I'm sorry, Samuel, I've let you down,\" Victoria choked out.\nSamuel's voice came through the phone, a low sigh, \"Victoria, whether you participate or not, I believe you have the talent to win.\"\nHearing his encouragement and praise, Victoria's nose stung even more, \"Thank you, Samuel.\"\nSamuel sighed again, \"Victoria, there's no need for thanks between us, but I have a suggestion for you. Would you like to hear it?\"\nVictoria immediately nodded, \"Okay.\"\n\"The competition doesn't limit the type of artwork. Although there are only a few days left until the competition deadline, and there's no time to paint a large oil painting, you could try using sketches; it might have unexpected results,\" Samuel suggested.",

        "content": "\"Using sketching?\" Victoria repeated his words.\nSketching indeed doesn't require much effort, but it demands a high level of creativity and expressiveness, so Victoria wasn't very confident.\nSeeing Victoria's hesitation, Samuel added, \"It doesn't matter if you win an award or not, just do your best. I just think that if you use sketching, you might really have a breakthrough.\"\nVictoria pressed her lips and thought for a moment, then finally nodded and said, \"Alright, Samuel, I'll do my best!\"\nAfter hanging up the phone, Victoria stood up, wiped the tears from her face, patted the dust off her clothes, and headed home.\nNo matter how difficult it is, no matter if she doesn't get the desired result, she will give it her all.\nBack home, she sat in front of her drawing board, gazing at the distant skyscrapers and traffic, and some fragmented images began to form in her mind.\nAfter a long time, she picked up a charcoal pencil and started sketching on the paper.\nShe stayed up all night, and the once blank paper gradually revealed the images in Victoria's mind.\nMost of the picture was of a bustling city's skyscrapers, the concrete jungle appearing cold and oppressive under the gray tones.\nThe sharp lines and distinct edges spoke of the city's fast pace and sense of alienation.\nIn the corner of the picture was a small street-side coffee shop.\nWarm light spilled out from the windows, illuminating a few tables and chairs at the entrance.\nAn old man sat there quietly, watching the passersby, his eyes full of stories.\nBeside him, a stray cat curled up, enjoying the moment of peace.\nVictoria used delicate lines to outline the old man's wrinkles and the stray cat's fur.\nThe coffee shop's sign was carefully drawn, with the lettering slightly worn, yet exuding a sense of timeless charm.\nOn the city's streets, Victoria drew people walking hurriedly, their figures blurred and busy, contrasting sharply with the tranquility of the old man and the stray cat.\nAt the top of the picture, Victoria drew a faint moon with light lines, its moonlight spilling over every corner of the city, as if bringing a touch of solace to the lonely city.\nAt the bottom of the picture, she wrote a small line: \"Find a touch of warmth in the hustle and bustle.\"\nVictoria stopped her pencil, her gaze fixed on that line of small text, unable to look away for a long time.\nShe didn't know if her painting would win an award, but she had no regrets about trying.\nThe next day was Saturday, and Victoria took her painting to Samuel's studio.\nSeeing her eyes with dark circles, Samuel raised an eyebrow, his tone a mix of surprise and concern, \"Did you stay up all night painting?\"\nVictoria nodded lightly.\nSamuel frowned, his tone filled with reproach and concern, \"Even if you're in a hurry, don't push yourself like this. Your health isn't great, what if you get sick?\"\nVictoria forced a smile and explained, \"I couldn't sleep, so I just finished it. Samuel, look, how did I do? What needs to be revised?\"\nOnly then did Samuel start to carefully examine Victoria's painting.\nHis gaze was focused and serious, as if trying to see into the depths of Victoria's heart through the painting.\nAfter a long time, Samuel nodded slightly, his tone carrying a hint of praise, \"Overall, this painting has a lot of potential. It's both creative and full of expression. That said, there are a couple of areas where it could be refined.\"\nHe pointed to the skyscrapers in the painting, \"The lines here can be more refined to highlight the texture and three-dimensionality of the buildings. Also, the tones can be colder to better reflect the city's indifference.\"\nThen he looked at the street-side coffee shop area, \"The lighting effect of the coffee shop can be enhanced to make the warm atmosphere more intense. The interaction between the old man and the stray cat can be more natural to add liveliness to the painting.\"\n\"Additionally, the background can be blurred a bit to make the main subjects stand out more.\"\nAfter saying all this, Samuel looked at Victoria's eyes with dark circles, feeling a pang of heartache, \"Victoria, your effort and talent are very touching. But don't push yourself so hard in the future. Your health is the foundation of your creativity; you must take care of yourself.\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes and responded softly, \"Okay.\"\nUnder Samuel's guidance, Victoria began to carefully revise her work.\nShe meticulously adjusted every detail, striving to make the painting the best it could be.\nWhen she was too tired, she would rest her head on the studio table for a short nap.\nSamuel watched her exhausted state, couldn't help but shake his head, sighed with heartache, and draped a blanket over her.\nVictoria only slept for half an hour before getting up to continue adjusting her work.\nIt wasn't until nightfall that she finally finished the revisions, leaning back in her chair, rubbing her sore neck.\nShe stretched, moved her stiff limbs, and looked to the side, only to see Samuel's smiling eyes.\nSamuel handed her a cup, gently saying, \"Have some tea.\"\nVictoria took it, holding the cup, sipping lightly, \"Samuel, thank you.\"\nSamuel chuckled, \"What's with the thanks between us?\"\nVictoria was slightly taken aback by his words, then smiled gently without saying anything.\nSamuel drove Victoria home, reminding her to rest well before leaving.\nAlthough Victoria felt physically exhausted, her spirits were high. She was about to take a bath and get a good night's sleep when she suddenly received a call from an unknown number.\nShe hesitated before answering, \"Who is this?\"\nA woman's voice came from the other end, \"Ms. Carter, it's Alice.\"\nVictoria's hand holding the phone paused for a moment, then she calmly said, \"Ms. Garcia, hello.\"\n\"Ms. Carter, do you remember what I mentioned to you at Aroma Garden Eatery last time?\"\n\"I remember.\"\nAlice's voice became cheerful, \"Tomorrow is my friend's bar opening, you promised me and Daisy to come and join us.\"\nVictoria hesitated for a moment but eventually agreed.\nIt wasn't surprising that Alice would contact her.\nA woman's intuition was always accurate.\nHow could she be indifferent to her boyfriend having an affair with another woman?\nAlice probably wanted to keep her away from William by inviting her and Daisy out.\nThat works too, she could use Alice's difficulty to stay away from him.\nHe cherished Alice so much, he wouldn't want to hurt her again, right?\nVictoria smiled bitterly.\nAfter hanging up, Alice stood by the window, looking at William's garden, a smile playing on her lips.\nWilliam happened to hear her call, frowned, and asked in a steady voice, \"You invited Victoria to the bar?\"\nAlice put away her phone, turned around, her cheeks flushed, her big eyes curved like crescents, \"Yes, I think Victoria is a nice girl. I don't have many friends in Silvermist City, so I thought I'd make a new friend.\"\n\"Don't be ridiculous!\" William said helplessly, \"How is she fit to be your friend?\"\nAlice stared into his eyes, her lips curling up, smiling as she asked, \"It's just making a friend, what's unfit about it? Or is it that you still have something with her, so you don't want me to get in touch with her?\"",

        "content": "William's pupils instantly contracted, and a deep, unfathomable cold light flashed in his eyes. \"What nonsense are you thinking? I have nothing to do with her anymore!\"\nAlice saw William's reaction and sneered inwardly, but her face remained unchanged.\nShe pouted and said coquettishly, \"Then why are you stopping me from being friends with Victoria? Besides, Daisy is there too.\"\nWilliam pondered for a moment and then slowly said, \"Since you insist on going, go ahead. I'll have Harry take you tomorrow.\"\nAlice's smile grew even brighter. \"Thank you, William.\"\nWilliam said nothing more and went upstairs to change his clothes.\nWatching his upright figure disappear around the corner, Alice's smile gradually faded, and her eyes darkened.\nDaisy originally didn't want to go to any bar.\nBut when she heard Alice say that Victoria would be there, she felt something was off.\nHowever, last time Victoria suddenly fell ill, and she was busy taking her to the doctor and forgot to get her contact information.\nSo, she had no choice but to go to the bar.\nWhen Victoria arrived at the bar, Daisy and Alice had already ordered their drinks and were sitting in a booth waiting for her.\nVictoria smiled apologetically. \"Sorry to keep you waiting.\"\nDaisy waved her hand with a smile. \"It's okay.\"\nAlice pulled her arm enthusiastically and invited her to sit. \"Come over and sit down. What would you like to drink?\"\nVictoria looked at the seats and sat on the other side, with Daisy in between, and said, \"Just a glass of Moscato for me.\"\nAlice glanced at Daisy sitting next to her and smiled. \"Alright.\"\nThen she called out to the waiter. \"Waiter, a glass of Moscato.\"\nVictoria took a sip. Moscato is a slightly sparkling wine with a rich fruity sweetness, almost like juice, and it's Victoria's favorite kind of wine.\nDaisy looked at her and smiled. \"Just like your dad, you can only drink low-alcohol wine, or you'll get drunk quickly.\"\nVictoria was slightly stunned, then pulled the corners of her mouth bitterly without saying anything.\nAlice was surprised to hear Daisy's words and asked, \"Daisy, you know Ms. Carter's dad?\"\nDaisy nodded without saying much.\nAlice didn't mind and looked at Victoria with a teasing smile. \"Ms. Carter is still single. The bar is having a singles matching event tonight. Do you want to join?\"\nVictoria was taken aback and smiled reluctantly. \"No, I'm not used to it.\"\nAlice looked at her and teased. \"Could it be that Ms. Carter still has feelings for William?\"\nThe tone was joking, but both Victoria and Daisy knew what she meant.\nDaisy glanced at her and said lightly. \"Alice, don't talk nonsense. William has a bad and stubborn temper, only you like him. Victoria doesn't care for him at all.\"\nAlice raised her eyebrows and pretended to be clueless. \"Really?\"\nSeeing Daisy's face turn cold, she immediately raised her hands in surrender. \"Alright, alright, pretend I didn't say anything. Ms. Carter, let's go dance.\"\nVictoria felt a bit awkward by her words, and when Alice pulled her to the dance floor, she couldn't refuse and reluctantly followed.\nShe had learned dance for a while as a child but never dared to try swaying her hips in front of everyone.\nAlice had studied abroad for a few years and seemed pure and reserved, but she was much more uninhibited than Victoria, pulling her to dance wildly in the dance floor, attracting the attention of many men.\nWith a sudden exclamation, Alice stepped on Victoria's foot, twisted hard, and then let go of her.\nVictoria stumbled back two or three steps, almost falling.\nAlice's lips curled slightly, and just as Victoria was about to fall, she caught her and steadied her.\nWhile Victoria wasn't paying attention, she secretly slipped a small packet into her pocket.\nAfter one dance, Alice excused herself, saying she was tired, and went back to the booth to drink.\nVictoria breathed a sigh of relief, sat on the sofa to rest, and chatted with Daisy.\nAfter two drinks, Alice excused herself that she felt a bit stuffy, and went out for some fresh air.\nVictoria watched her leave, deep in thought.\nDaisy also looked at Alice's back suspiciously and murmured, \"What's up with her? She's acting weird.\"\nVictoria shook her head, indicating she didn't know.\nShe thought Alice had invited her out to test her relationship with William.\nBut all night, Alice only mentioned him once and said nothing else.\nWas she trying to get her drunk and then get information out of her?\nVictoria's mind was a bit muddled. She felt like a guilty thief, always worried about being caught, but also thinking it would be good if Alice could control William.\nThat way, she would be free.\nThis contradiction made Victoria a bit anxious.\nBut after waiting for almost half an hour, Alice still hadn't returned.\nDaisy called her, but there was no answer.\nVictoria frowned, suddenly having a bad feeling.\nThinking of this, she quickly got up and walked outside to see if Alice was there.\nJust as she reached the door, the music suddenly stopped, and the dim bar lights were all turned on.\nPeople who had been dancing to the music stopped and looked around in surprise.\nDaisy stood on the steps, looking around with a serious expression.\nVictoria also sensed something was wrong and looked towards the door, following Daisy's gaze.\nShe saw seven or eight police officers file in, quickly sealing off all the exits of the bar.\nA police officer who looked like the leader walked over, glanced at the bar's patrons, and said in a deep voice, \"Everyone, stand against the wall. We will conduct a search on you.\"\nDaisy and Victoria exchanged a glance and followed the instructions, standing in a line against the wall.\nThe police searched each person one by one.\nSoon, it was Victoria's turn.\nVictoria clenched her fists, trying to stay calm, letting the policewoman search her.\nShe had a feeling this unexpected check was aimed at her.\nHer right hand was tightly clenched, her palm sweaty.\nHer heart was pounding like a drum.\nThe policewoman searched her upper body and then moved to her pockets.\nThis position made Victoria feel particularly ashamed, especially in front of everyone.\nShe tried hard to endure, controlling her urge to push the policewoman away.\nJust as she was about to breathe a sigh of relief, the policewoman's hand suddenly stopped.\nVictoria's heart tightened.\nThe policewoman took out a packet of white powder and held it in front of Victoria, saying in a deep voice, \"What is this?\"\nVictoria's pupils contracted sharply, and her face instantly turned pale.",

        "content": "She tried to stay rational and shook her head, \"I don't know where this came from.\"\nDaisy had already been searched and was terrified by the scene. She quickly stood up to intervene, \"Officer, this might be a misunderstanding.\"\nThe female officer's eyes flashed with coldness as she looked at her, \"Shut up! Who allowed you to interrupt? Do you want me to take you in as well?\"\nDaisy's face stiffened, and she reluctantly closed her mouth.\nVictoria took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down, and said frankly, \"This is indeed not mine. I can go with you to investigate.\"\nThe female officer took out handcuffs and cuffed her, taking her away.\nBefore leaving, Victoria, holding back her fear, looked at Daisy with red-rimmed eyes.\nDaisy looked at her with heartache and said softly, \"Don't be afraid. Leave the rest to me. I will get you out as soon as possible.\"\nVictoria bit her lip, tears rolling down her cheeks, and nodded vigorously before being taken away by the police.\nSeeing Victoria being taken away, Daisy felt like she was about to explode with anger.\nShe took out her phone and called Alice again, but there was still no answer.\nHolding back her anger, she dialed William's number.\nThe phone rang for a long time, but no one answered. She grabbed her bag and rushed out, bumping into a waiter on the way, spilling the drinks on the tray.\n\"I'm sorry, miss, really sorry.\"\nDaisy didn't have time to argue with the waiter and hurried to the garage.\nShe continued to call William several times, but still, no one answered.\nDaisy was so furious that she almost smashed her phone, cursing, \"Damn William!\"\nShe was about to drive to the police station when she remembered she had been drinking as she touched the steering wheel.\nWith no other choice, she went out to hail a cab.\nBy the time she got a cab, it was completely dark.\nThe night breeze cleared her slightly dizzy mind a bit, and she stopped the futile attempts to call William, instead calling Harry.\nHarry answered the phone quickly.\nDaisy asked bluntly, \"Where are William and Alice?\"\nOn the other end, Harry hesitated for a moment, then said in a hoarse voice, \"What do you need Mr. Scott for?\"\n\"Cut the crap! Tell me where they are now!\" Daisy shouted angrily.\nHarry hesitated but finally answered honestly, \"Ms. Garcia is in the hospital, and Mr. Scott is with her.\"\nDaisy was stunned for a moment, then gritted her teeth, \"Wasn't she fine just now? How did she end up in the hospital?\"\n\"Ms. Garcia was drugged at the bar.\"\n\"Good job, Alice. I really underestimated her,\" Daisy said, suppressing her anger, and sneered, \"So you all knew Victoria was taken by the police and deliberately didn't answer my calls, right?\"\nThere was a moment of silence on the other end of the line.\nAfter a while, Harry's voice came through, \"We didn't know it was Ms. Carter who did it.\"\n\"Didn't know?\" Daisy laughed angrily, \"Don't tell me William couldn't figure out who was behind this.\"\nHarry remained silent.\nDaisy sneered, \"Fine, I don't want to talk to you anymore. Tell William I will personally hold him accountable for this.\"\nHanging up the phone, Daisy punched the car seat hard and started calling her lawyer.\nIn the interrogation room, Victoria sat on a cold, hard metal chair, her fingers unconsciously intertwined.\nDespite her efforts to appear calm, she couldn't stop trembling.\nThe female officer poured her a cup of water and said coldly, \"Victoria, right? Cooperate with the investigation honestly to avoid suffering.\"\nThe cold white fluorescent light mercilessly illuminated the entire room, highlighting the pallor on Victoria's face.\nThe female officer glanced at her and then began to ask, \"What is your name, age, occupation, home address?\"\nVictoria reported her information truthfully.\n\"Victoria, we need you to cooperate with our investigation. Please explain in detail what happened at the bar tonight.\"\nVictoria took a deep breath, trying to calm herself.\nHer voice carried a barely noticeable tremor, \"Officer, I really didn't do anything. I just went to the bar with my friends to relax. I don't know how the drugs ended up on me.\"\nThe female officer continued, \"Do you know Alice?\"\nVictoria nodded, \"Yes, I went to the bar with her.\"\nAn older officer scrutinized her and continued to ask, \"What is your relationship with Alice? Have you had any disagreements?\"\nVictoria shook her head, her voice weak, \"We are just ordinary friends. Before tonight, we never had any disputes.\"\nThe older officer then asked, \"So why were there drugs in your pocket? Can you explain that?\"\nVictoria's face turned even paler, her lips trembling slightly as she tried to suppress her inner panic, \"I don't know how those drugs got into my pocket. I swear, I have never touched those things.\"\nThe two officers exchanged a glance and continued to ask, \"Did you leave your seat at any point tonight? Or did you notice anyone suspicious approaching your seat?\"\nVictoria's heart raced, and she felt a wave of dizziness, but she forced herself to focus and recall, \"I went to the restroom, but it was only for a short time. As for suspicious people, the bar was crowded, and I didn't notice anything unusual.\"\nThe older officer paused and then said, \"We have a witness who says you had an intimate relationship with Alice's boyfriend. Did you try to harm her out of jealousy?\"\nVictoria's face turned ashen, her voice trembling, unable to form a complete sentence, \"I, I...\"\nSeeing this, the older officer slammed the table and shouted, \"Enough! We don't have time for your stammering!\"\nVictoria looked up at them in fear, seeing their serious expressions and eyes filled with anger.\nHer breath caught, and she clenched her fists tightly, \"I did have an intimate relationship with her boyfriend, but I never wanted to harm her, let alone use drugs to harm her.\"\nThe officers recorded every word Victoria said and then stated, \"We will investigate all the evidence, including the bar's surveillance footage. Until the investigation is complete, you will need to stay at the police station.\"\nAfter the interrogation, Victoria was taken back to the holding cell.\nVictoria knew these accusations were Alice's schemes to frame her, but she had no evidence to prove her innocence.\nShe squatted against the wall, staring blankly at the darkening sky outside the window.",

        "content": "Meanwhile, Daisy also arrived at the police station. She went straight to the officer on duty and said, \"I'm here to bail out Victoria. Please help me with the paperwork.\"\nThe officer on duty checked the records and then shook his head. \"I'm sorry, ma'am, but she isn't eligible for bail right now. The case is still under investigation, and we can't release her right now.\"\nDaisy's face darkened, and she raised her voice a bit. \"Why? I can pay the highest bail amount. I want her out immediately.\"\nThe officer on duty, accustomed to such reactions from family members, remained calm.\nHe patiently explained to Daisy, \"This case involves drugs, and someone has been hospitalized because of it. According to the rules, we can't release anyone until the investigation is complete.\"\nDaisy was about to say something when her lawyer, Jagger, also arrived at the police station. He patted Daisy on the shoulder, signaling her to stay calm.\nJagger said to the officer on duty, \"I am Ms. Scott's attorney. We need to know the progress of the case.\"\nThe officer on duty glanced at the records. \"We are currently investigating the source of the drugs and the people involved.\"\nDaisy's face turned red with anger. She turned to Jagger and asked urgently, \"Is there really no way? Victoria is innocent. She's young and must be terrified.\"\nJagger whispered to Daisy, \"Ms. Scott, please calm down. This matter can be serious. If the drug charges are confirmed, Victoria could face severe legal consequences. The most important thing now is to cooperate with the police investigation and find evidence in her favor.\"\nDaisy took a deep breath, barely suppressing her anger, and then said to the officer, \"I request a visit.\"\nThe officer hesitated for a second and then agreed. \"Okay.\"\nVictoria had never felt a wait this long before. She curled up in a corner, hugging her knees, with her head buried in them, tears streaming down her cheeks.\nAt that moment, the iron door suddenly made a noise. Victoria quickly looked up and saw Daisy standing outside the bars.\n\"Victoria!\" Daisy's voice was filled with heartache when she saw Victoria's haggard and pale appearance. \"Don't be afraid. I will get you out as soon as possible.\"\nVictoria pressed her dry lips together and choked out, \"Ms. Scott, thank you for coming to help me.\"\nDaisy reached out to touch her cold, stiff cheek and softly comforted her, \"I was there almost the whole time yesterday, except when you and Alice went to the dance floor. Can you tell me if anything unusual happened?\"\nVictoria thought carefully and said, \"Nothing special, just that she suddenly tripped me while we were dancing, and I almost fell. She then pulled me back. And then...\"\nAt this point, Victoria hesitated, her eyes turning red as if she wanted to cry but held back her tears.\nSeeing this, Daisy sighed and patted Victoria's shoulder. \"Alright, don't worry. I've already hired a lawyer for you.\"\nVictoria bit her lip lightly. \"Ms. Scott, I'm sorry for causing you trouble.\"\nDaisy shook her head with a smile. \"Silly girl, it's the Scott family that caused you trouble. You are the victim.\"\nVictoria felt a lump in her throat.\nShe knew very well who was behind this disaster, but from beginning to end, she never had a choice.\nShe was just a person with no support, at the mercy of the Scott family and the Garcia family.\nDaisy found out from Harry which hospital Alice was in and hurried there.\nIn the hospital room, Daisy didn't see William, only Alice lying in bed, which made her furious.\nShe walked to the bedside, grabbed Alice by the collar, and demanded, \"Why did you do this?\"\nAlice's face was deathly pale, her lips blue, seemingly in unbearable pain.\nDaisy's brow furrowed tightly. She let go of Alice and scolded, \"Stop pretending! You set Victoria up, didn't you?\"\n\"Daisy...\" Alice called weakly, \"Don't you believe me?\"\nAlice coughed violently and slowly said, \"Daisy, you misunderstood. I was really drugged. I felt dizzy and panicked as soon as I left the bar and rushed to the hospital...\"\nDaisy was about to say something when the door was kicked open.\nWilliam rushed in with medicine in hand, anxiously asking, \"How are you now?\"\nAlice gave him a weak smile and replied, \"I'm just a bit dizzy, nothing serious.\"\nThen she turned her head to look at Daisy, sadly saying, \"Daisy, I know you blame me. I regret it too. If I had known it was Victoria, I wouldn't have called the police!\"\nDaisy laughed in anger. \"Do you think we're all fools?\"\nShe couldn't believe that Alice would resort to self-harm to frame Victoria.\nShe was ruthless to others and to herself.\nIt was truly terrifying.\nHow could William like such a venomous person?\nAlice's face grew even paler, and she continued coughing, shaking her head. \"I'm not lying!\"\nSeeing this, William quickly stopped Daisy from questioning further, his brow furrowed. \"Aunt Daisy, she's still sick. Let's talk outside.\"\nDaisy glared at Alice before following William out of the room.\nIn the hospital corridor, Daisy looked at William's detestable face, wanting to slap him.\n\"William, I don't believe you can't see who's behind this,\" Daisy scolded. \"Do you know Victoria could be sentenced?\"\n\"I'll handle this. You stay out of it.\"\nDaisy was furious. \"Stay out of it? William, you're insane. You forced such a young girl into a relationship with you, and now she's facing serious charges because of you, and you want me to do nothing?\"\nWilliam frowned. \"Don't worry. It's just a lesson. She won't actually go to jail.\"\nDaisy sneered. \"How kind of you. But have you thought about how scared Victoria is now? She's linked to drugs. If people find out, how will she live? William, you and Alice are heartless!\"\nWilliam had nothing to say, only grunting. \"Anyway, I'll handle it.\"\nDaisy was livid and pushed him hard. \"I don't care what you do. Victoria must be released by tomorrow morning, or I'll tell your grandfather everything!\"",

His health is already poor.\"\nDaisy sneered, \"What, did I hit a sore spot?\"\nWilliam did not respond, a complex emotion faintly flickering in his deep eyes.\nAfter a while, he spoke lightly, \"Don't worry, Victoria will be out by tomorrow morning.\"\nDaisy snorted coldly and walked away.\nVictoria hadn't slept all night, staring intently at the door of the detention room.\nShe was very scared, afraid that she would really end up like Alvin, being arrested and sent to prison.\nHer eyes, swollen from crying all night, were already as puffy as walnuts, her nose was red, and her face was pale, with dark circles under her eyes.\nShe lowered her head, her expression stiff, constantly rubbing her fingertips, as if this could reduce a bit of fear and despair.\nIn the morning, the door of the detention room opened again, and a police officer appeared at the door, coldly announcing, \"Victoria, you can go.\"\nUpon hearing this, Victoria's eyes widened in surprise. She asked blankly, \"You said, I can go?\"\nThe police officer repeated expressionlessly, \"You can go.\"\nVictoria signed the papers in a daze and walked out of the police station.\nAs soon as she stepped out of the police station, her tears burst out uncontrollably-she was saved! Finally freed!\nVictoria walked down the steps in a daze, almost missing a step and falling.\nWilliam was sitting in the car, watching her tears roll down her face like broken pearls, his heart inexplicably tightening.\nHe drove the car in front of Victoria, rolled down the window, and was about to call her to get in.\nSitting next to him was Alice, who insisted on coming to pick up Victoria despite her discomfort. She spoke first, \"Ms. Carter.\"\nVictoria suddenly looked up, her gaze meeting William's and Alice's. She was stunned for a few seconds, then quickly looked away, wiped her tears, and turned to leave.\nSeeing this, William hurriedly called out to Victoria, \"Get in the car.\"\nVictoria's back stiffened. She didn't turn around, only said softly, \"No need, thank you. I'll go back by myself.\"\n\"Ms. Carter, are you mad at me?\" Alice's charming voice reached Victoria's ears, her tone full of deep apology, \"I'm really sorry, it's all because of me that you suffered.\"\nVictoria's steps suddenly halted, but she didn't speak.\nLooking at Alice's innocent face, her heart sank to the bottom.\nShe finally remembered what Ella had told her-Alice is a lunatic, she won't let you go.\nAnd she remembered the hideous scar on Ella's body.\nShe felt a chill all over.\nThis Alice was terrifying, like a venomous snake lurking in the grass, silently flicking its tongue.\nThe moment you let your guard down, it would pounce and bite you to death.\nSeeing her like this, William was immediately annoyed, \"Haven't we already let you out? Alice suffered so much and still came to pick you up personally, what more do you want?\"\nVictoria gritted her teeth, trying hard to suppress the anger surging inside her, and said hoarsely, \"I don't want anything. Please don't disturb my life anymore! I just want to live my life in peace.\"\nWith that, Victoria dared not stay any longer and ran towards the roadside.\nShe ran so fast that she accidentally twisted her ankle and stumbled to the ground, looking both pitiful and pathetic.\nWilliam hurriedly pushed open the car door to help her up, not noticing Alice's venomous gaze behind him.\nHer gaze was fixed on Victoria, as if she wanted to carve a piece of flesh out of her.\nWilliam helped Victoria stand up, sighing lightly, \"Victoria, Alice she...\"\nLooking at his handsome face, full of protection and favoritism for Alice, Victoria suddenly felt very pathetic.\nShe slowly lowered her head and said softly, \"She's not wrong, I am. I shouldn't have gotten entangled with you, ruining your relationship. I deserve this; it's my own fault.\"\nAs she spoke, she couldn't help but choke up.\nSeeing her cry, William felt irritated and impatiently said, \"Victoria, enough! Stop talking!\"\nVictoria looked up at his eyes, her own eyes slightly wet, \"First it was Ella, now it's Alice. Because of you, my life will never be peaceful. What did I do wrong to deserve this torment from you?\"\nWilliam frowned, his thin lips slightly parted, wanting to say something but ultimately saying nothing.\nLooking at his profile, Victoria murmured, \"William, you're a bastard.\"\nWith that, she pushed William away and tried to leave.\nHowever, William grabbed her wrist and forcefully pushed her into the car.\nSeeing Alice's deep eyes, Victoria's struggling body suddenly stopped. She pressed her lips tightly and lowered her head, saying nothing.\nAlice glanced at Victoria, then smiled elegantly at William, \"Let's take Ms. Carter home quickly.\"\nVictoria shrank her neck and sat in the back seat, silent, not looking at anyone.\nAlice's lips curled into a mocking smile, then turned into a gentle smile, \"Ms. Carter, you don't look well. Do you need me to take you to the hospital?\"\nHearing this, Victoria suddenly looked up at her, her eyes red, \"No need, I'll just rest at home. I don't want to trouble you and Mr. Scott. Mr. Scott is a good boss, but I don't want to be too much.\"\nShe believed that with Alice's intelligence, she would surely understand the underlying meaning of her words.\nSure enough, Alice's smile deepened, \"Since you insists, we won't force you. How about this, I'll treat you to a meal on Saturday to apologize, how about that?\"\n\"No need!\" Victoria refused urgently, then added, \"Thank you for your kindness, Ms. Garcia, but next Saturday, I have plans to go skiing with my boyfriend, so I really don't have time.\"\nUpon hearing this, William's pupils suddenly contracted.\nHis grip on the steering wheel tightened.\nAlice's eyes flickered, and she continued to probe, \"When did you get a boyfriend, Ms. Carter?\"\nTo dispel her targeting thoughts, Victoria replied, \"He's the one who had dinner with me at Aroma Garden Eatery last time. He confessed to me, and I accepted.\"\n\"Really? You two are quite a match, congratulations.\" Alice deliberately elongated her words, her smile growing brighter.\n\"Indeed, a good match,\" William said lightly, his eyes dark.\nVictoria only felt a chill down her spine.\nSeeing his unpleasant expression, Alice's lips curled slightly, and she continued, \"I haven't skied in a long time either. William, why don't we join them? The more, the merrier.\"",

She opened her mouth, wanting to stop him. But just as she was about to speak, Alice beat her to it, \"Great, William, I'm so happy you can come with me! Ms. Carter, you must introduce your boyfriend to us then.\"\nVictoria was stunned for a moment, and finally could only nod helplessly.\nAlice smiled with satisfaction, looking very pleased, while William remained silent, looking increasingly gloomy.\nBack home, Victoria received a call from Daisy, confirming that she had been sent home by William, which made her breathe a sigh of relief.\nDaisy told Victoria that there were some matters in Harborview City that needed her attention, and asked Victoria to take care of herself.\nVictoria agreed to everything.\nAfter hanging up the phone, Victoria lay on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.\nLast night's experience was as absurd as a nightmare.\nShe was really scared.\nAlice's methods were even more ruthless and vicious than Ella's.\nTo frame her, she even went so far as to poison herself.\nThinking about it, Victoria couldn't help but feel a chill in her heart.\nHow could she make Alice give up her malice towards her?\nVictoria thought of the skiing date she had made up and decided to go through with it.\nShe took out her phone and called Samuel.\nThe phone rang for a few seconds before it was answered, and Samuel's clear voice came through, \"Victoria.\"\nVictoria called out somewhat uneasily, \"Samuel.\"\nSamuel heard the unusual tone in Victoria's voice and asked with concern, \"What's wrong? Did something happen?\"\nVictoria hesitated whether to tell him about last night.\nBut thinking carefully, she didn't want him to know about her feud with Alice, in case Samuel got involved, she would feel guilty.\nSo she decided not to tell him about it, and just asked nervously, \"Samuel, do you have time next weekend? My friend invited me to go skiing, do you want to come with me?\"\nSamuel immediately agreed cheerfully, \"Of course, Victoria, I'm at your service.\"\nHearing Samuel's response, Victoria finally felt half relieved.\nShe exhaled a breath and said, \"Okay, see you next weekend then.\"\nWhen the appointed time came, Samuel drove to pick up Victoria and arrived at the foot of the snow mountain.\nWilliam and Alice were already there.\nWilliam was wearing a pure black ski suit, with a hat and sunglasses, standing there straight.\nAlice was wearing a bright yellow down jacket today, with a brown knitted hat, a somewhat youthful outfit that looked particularly playful on her, especially highlighting her delicate skin and features.\nWilliam was gently adjusting her clothes, his eyes full of affection, as if honey was about to overflow.\nSeeing this, Victoria suddenly felt a bit dazed.\nSamuel parked the car and put the rabbit fur hat that Victoria had left in the car on her, and Victoria smiled embarrassedly.\nSeeing their intimate interaction, Alice's mouth curved into a smile, and she glanced at William.\nHis handsome face showed no emotion, as if he hadn't noticed the interaction between Victoria and Samuel at all.\nA mocking smile flashed in Alice's eyes, but it quickly disappeared, and she returned to her usual self.\nShe walked up to William, took his arm, and said with a smile, \"William, let's go quickly.\"\nSaying this, she pulled him to Victoria and Samuel, nodded slightly to Victoria, then turned to the mature and handsome Samuel, and said with a smile, \"Mr. Brown, right? We met once at Aroma Garden Eatery.\"\nSamuel nodded politely to her and said with a smile, \"Yes, Ms. Garcia, hello.\"\nWilliam frowned at Samuel, a look of disgust flashing in his eyes, he put his arm around Alice's waist, nodded to Samuel, and said in a low voice, \"Let's go, it's time to go up the mountain.\"\nWith that, he walked towards the ski field first.\nSeeing this, Alice's smile deepened, she glanced at Victoria, then shyly leaned into William's arms, \"William, slow down, be careful not to slip.\"\nWatching their backs, Victoria also smiled sweetly at Samuel, \"Let's go too.\"\nThe ski field was located on Snowflake Peak in the western suburbs of Silvermist City, covering a large area, with not only large camping tents, ski slopes, and other facilities, but also many amusement devices around.\nThe group took the cable car up, moving slowly.\nAlice stayed close to William, occasionally chatting with him, looking very intimate.\nVictoria pretended not to see, looking out at the snow through the window, occasionally chatting with Samuel and Alice.\nAfter about half an hour, the cable car slowly descended, stopping at the top of the ski field.\nVictoria opened the door and got off the cable car, immediately feeling a biting cold wind hit her face.\nSamuel stepped forward, took out a mask and goggles from his coat pocket, and handed them to Victoria, \"Victoria, put these on.\"\nVictoria took the mask and goggles, gave Samuel a light smile, and then turned to put them on.\nSeeing this, Alice smiled and said, \"Mr. Brown is really considerate and thoughtful, Ms. Carter is so lucky to have such a boyfriend.\"\nVictoria looked at Samuel somewhat awkwardly, not denying it.\nSamuel was open and honest, smiling, \"Ms. Garcia, you're too kind.\"\nWilliam said impatiently, \"Are you done with the compliments? Are we skiing or not?\"\nAlice pouted, \"Alright, alright, you're the most impatient.\"\nWith that, she took the initiative to hold his hand and went to the service desk to get their specially ordered ski equipment.\nThe four of them got dressed, carrying their skis to the ski field.\nAlice said as she walked, \"Ms. Carter, do you know how to ski?\"\nVictoria shook her head.\nShe had made up the skiing plan on the spot, she had seen an advertisement for the ski field while sitting in the car, so she came up with the idea.\n\"It's okay, Victoria, I'll teach you.\" Samuel chimed in at the right time, \"I used to be on the school ski team.\"\nWilliam snorted, giving Samuel a sidelong glance, and said in a hostile tone, \"Mr. Brown, you seem to be good at everything. How about a competition later?\"",

        "content": "Samuel raised an eyebrow and smiled faintly, \"Mr. Scott, if you're that keen on our skiing race, I'll gladly take you on. But first, let me teach Victoria some basic skills, otherwise, she would be so bored just watching us play.\"\nAfter saying that, he gently winked at Victoria.\nSeeing the two men at odds, Victoria suddenly felt a headache coming on.\nAlice heard this, a shadow flickered in her eyes, and then she looked at William with a sweet smile and said coquettishly, \"You still act like a child!\"\nA slight smile showed on William's lips, but he said nothing.\nHe glanced at Victoria again, then withdrew his gaze and said to Samuel, \"Mr. Brown, how about we race on the professional ski slope in an hour?\"\n\"Sure.\"\nVictoria looked at the two men, each unwilling to back down, and sighed inwardly.\nShe had long experienced William's domineering and arrogant nature, but she didn't expect him to even hold a grudge against Samuel.\nAlice pulled William towards the advanced ski slope.\nThe advanced ski slope was very steep, usually with a gradient of over 20-30 degrees.\nSuch a steep slope allowed skiers to reach very high speeds, which was a great test of their skills and courage.\nAlice's skiing skills were good, and William's were even better. He led Alice down the steep slope effortlessly, as if it were flat ground.\nAlice followed behind him, her beautiful and charming eyes filled with deep admiration.\nBut thinking of the annoying Victoria, her heart sank to the bottom.\nShe must find a way to make Victoria completely cut ties with William!\nShe lowered her eyes to hide the malice in them and sped up to catch up with William.\nVictoria stared at them for a long time until Samuel pulled her towards the beginner's area, and she came back to her senses and followed him.\nSamuel was wearing a black professional ski suit today, his tall and upright figure looking even more handsome in it.\nHis hair was slightly tousled by the wind, adding a bit of casualness. His gaze at Victoria was deep and warm.\nHe bent down slightly, carefully checking Victoria's ski bindings, and said softly, \"Victoria, don't be nervous, skiing is actually very fun. First, we need to keep our balance, with our knees slightly bent.\"\nAs he spoke, he gently adjusted Victoria's posture with his hands, making her center of gravity more stable.\nVictoria listened attentively to Samuel's explanation of skiing knowledge. Although she was initially nervous and stiff, afraid to take a step, she gradually relaxed and learned how to maintain her balance under Samuel's guidance.\nSamuel patted her head appreciatively, \"Great job! You've already got the hang of it.\"\nVictoria shyly smiled and stood obediently by his side.\nSamuel continued to patiently teach Victoria, \"Now let's learn to turn. When turning, lean your body slightly in the direction of the turn, but not too much.\"\nAs he spoke, he demonstrated.\nSamuel held her hand and led her down the slope.\nUnder Samuel's guidance, Victoria became more proficient and began to try skiing down a small slope on her own.\nSamuel followed closely behind, ready to protect her at any moment.\nSuddenly, Victoria lost her footing and fell forward.\nSamuel was prepared and quickly caught Victoria in his arms.\nVictoria stiffened for a moment but soon relaxed, letting him hold her.\nSamuel looked down at Victoria in his arms, his gaze deep and tender.\nFeeling uncomfortable under his gaze, Victoria struggled slightly, \"Let... let go of me.\"\nSamuel steadied her and smiled, \"Alright.\"\nAfter standing firm, Victoria suddenly felt a chill and looked up to see William had returned at some point, staring at her and Samuel with a cold gaze.\nVictoria instinctively looked away, avoiding his gaze, and hurriedly left with a sense of panic.\nWilliam narrowed his eyes, a dangerous glint flashing in them.\nSamuel also saw William and smirked before shouting, \"Mr. Scott, is it time?\"\nWilliam nodded coldly and pointed to the professional ski slope, \"Please, Mr. Brown.\"\nWith that, William entered the professional ski slope first, followed by Samuel.\nThis was the most challenging ski slope, with a very steep gradient, usually around 30-40 degrees.\nThe terrain was also very complex, with possible cliffs, boulders, and forests, requiring extremely high skiing skills and experience.\nVictoria stared at them, hesitating whether to follow and watch.\nAlice came over, smiling as she took Victoria's arm, \"Ms. Carter, let's go over there and take a look.\"\nVictoria hesitated for a moment but ultimately chose to follow Alice into the professional ski slope.\nSamuel and William stood at the highest point, both handsome men attracting the attention of everyone on the ski field.\nWilliam coldly glanced at Victoria watching from a distance, his thin lips curling into a mocking smile before turning his gaze to Samuel and asking coldly, \"Do you like her?\"\nAs his words fell, Samuel's smile froze for a second, then he admitted without hesitation, \"Yes.\"\n\"She doesn't like you.\"\n\"I know.\"\nWilliam frowned, \"If you know, why are you still so stubborn?\"\nSamuel laughed, glancing at Victoria below, \"Just because she doesn't like me now doesn't mean she won't in the future.\"\nWilliam sneered, \"I advise you to give up early, she will never fall for you.\"\nUnfazed by his provocation, Samuel replied, \"She doesn't like me? Does she like you? Like you for bullying her to get back at her father?\"\nA flicker of panic crossed William's eyes. How did he know he was avenging Alvin?\nHe glared at Samuel, his voice harsh, \"Samuel, I warn you, if you dare to talk nonsense in front of Victoria, don't blame me for being rude.\"\nSamuel sneered, \"What, angry out of shame? I'm just telling the truth. Someone like you doesn't deserve happiness. But don't worry, I never stoop to such low tactics to defeat my opponents. I will make Victoria genuinely fall in love with me.\"\nSamuel finished and provocatively smiled at William, \"Shall we start, Mr. Scott?\"\n\"Fine,\" William said coldly.\nThen, the two men leaped high and jumped onto the ski slope.\nBoth performed high-difficulty moves, stunning the crowd and drawing applause and cheers.\nWilliam took the lead, leaning forward, pushing off with his legs, and his skis gliding swiftly over the snow, kicking up a spray of snow.\nHe skillfully controlled his direction, navigating the steep slope as if it were flat ground, quickly weaving through the gates.\nSamuel was not to be outdone, using his superb skills and excellent balance to closely follow William.",

        "content": "At a sharp turn, Samuel showcased his exceptional skills.\nHe leaned his body inward, his skis cutting precisely into the snow, completing the turn at an incredible speed.\nWilliam was equally impressive, adjusting his balance to navigate the turn in a more stable manner.\nVictoria clenched her hands nervously, silently cheering for Samuel's brilliant performance while also worrying for William.\nHaving known William for so long, she never realized he was so good at skiing.\nAlice glanced at the two skiing men, then at the nervous Victoria, revealing a venomous smile.\nShe hadn't expected William to compete with Samuel for Victoria.\nIt seemed she had underestimated Victoria's place in his heart.\nBut fortunately, not only had Victoria not noticed, but William himself hadn't realized his attention towards Victoria, thinking he just wanted to get back at her.\nAlice clenched her fists tightly, her eyes flashing with malicious calculation.\nThe surrounding spectators were also captivated by the exciting race, exclaiming in amazement.\nAs the race progressed, the two men's speed increased, and the competition grew fiercer.\nThey sped down the slope, their figures like two streaks of lightning.\nWilliam constantly sought opportunities to overtake Samuel, while Samuel remained vigilant, giving William no chance.\nOn the final straight, William decided to sprint with all his might.\nHe pushed hard with his legs, increasing his speed, his ski poles moving rapidly on the snow.\nSamuel also felt the pressure, accelerating to maintain his lead.\nVictoria's eyes were fixed on the finish line, her nerves at their peak.\nShe didn't know whether she wanted Samuel or William to win.\nThe surrounding spectators held their breath, eagerly awaiting the final result.\nIn the end, Samuel crossed the finish line first by a narrow margin.\nHe stopped his skis, removed his goggles, and panted heavily, sweat beading on his forehead.\nWilliam followed closely behind, crossing the finish line.\nHe took off his skis, threw his goggles on the ground, and walked away without looking at Victoria.\nAlice stepped forward, picked up William's discarded items, and quickly followed him.\nShe then turned to Victoria and Samuel with a smile and said, \"Ms. Carter, Mr. Brown, if you don't mind, we're heading to the hotel at the ski resort to rest. I've already booked the rooms, just give your names when you arrive. See you tonight!\"\nVictoria softly agreed, watching them leave.\nOnce they were out of sight, Victoria finally breathed a sigh of relief.\nSamuel removed his gear, walked up to Victoria, and asked with a smile, \"How was it? Not bad, right?\"\nVictoria nodded, genuinely praising, \"Very impressive.\"\nHearing Victoria's words, Samuel couldn't help but smile and said softly, \"Actually, I have even better skills in the bedroom.\"\nHis voice was so low that Victoria didn't hear clearly and asked, \"What did you say?\"\n\"Nothing, let's go, I'll take you to try other activities.\"\n\"Okay,\" Victoria nodded.\nWilliam stormed back to the luxurious hotel suite, immediately grabbed the water cup on the table, and drank it all.\nHe felt a burning rage in his chest, wanting to tear Samuel apart.\nHe never thought he would do something so childish and ridiculous, competing with someone over a woman.\nAnd he lost!\nHe felt like he was going crazy!\nAlice followed him into the room, seeing William's furious expression, her hatred for Victoria growing stronger.\nHowever, she controlled her emotions, smiling as she approached to comfort William, \"William, don't be angry, let me help you cool down, okay?\"\nAs she spoke, she reached out to touch William's neck.\nHer fingers were cold, touching William's skin, making him feel a tingling sensation.\nThis feeling made him a bit dazed.\nBut he quickly regained his composure, grabbing Alice's mischievous hand and sternly scolding, \"Who taught you these things?\"\nAlice was taken aback, pouting in grievance, \"William, I...\"\nSeeing her pitiful look, William softened and said gently, \"Be good, don't learn these things, you don't need to.\"\nAlice dug her nails into her palm, suppressing her anger, and squeezed out a tear.\n\"William, do you despise me because of the past?\"\nWilliam was stunned, his tone softening, \"No, how could you think that?\"\nAlice raised her red-rimmed eyes, \"Then why?\"\n\"Alice, you know, I want to wait until we get married...\"\nBefore William could finish, Alice suddenly hugged him, crying, \"William, please, don't hate me. I'm really afraid of losing you.\"\n\"Silly girl, how could I?\" William patted her back, comforting her gently.\nAlice buried her head in his chest, a cold smile on her lips.\nHer heart was filled with hatred, and she vowed to repay today's humiliation to Victoria a hundredfold.\nUnder Samuel's guidance, Victoria practiced a few more laps, gradually getting the hang of skiing and no longer as clumsy as before.\nWhen she took off her skis, she found her ankles aching badly, almost unable to stand.\n\"What's wrong? Are you in pain?\" Samuel quickly supported her, frowning with concern.\n\"It's nothing, just a bit sore,\" Victoria shook her head.\n\"Wait here for a moment,\" Samuel said, helping her to sit down.\nHe took their gear to the storage area and then returned.\nHe knelt beside Victoria, checking her injury.\nVictoria wanted to refuse, but her right foot hurt so much that she went along with Samuel's actions.\nSamuel removed her shoe, carefully examining her ankle.\n\"Fortunately, it's not a sprain.\"\nSamuel helped her put her shoe back on, then scooped her up in his arms.\nVictoria cried out in surprise, \"Samuel!\"\nSamuel smiled and explained, \"I'm carrying you back to the hotel to rest.\"\nVictoria struggled to get down, but Samuel insisted, \"Don't worry, I'm just taking you there, I won't take advantage of you.\"\nVictoria initially wanted to resist, but then she thought about the terrifying Alice at the hotel. Being close to Samuel might ease Alice's hostility towards her.\nWith this in mind, she stopped struggling.\n\"Thank you,\" Victoria said softly.\nSamuel smiled and said nothing more, carrying Victoria back to the hotel.\nWilliam and Alice were chatting in the lobby, waiting for them to return for dinner, and saw Samuel and Victoria's intimate behavior.",

If you make too much trouble with him, Ms. Carter will be unhappy.\"\nUpon hearing this, a trace of ruthlessness flashed in William's deep eyes but quickly disappeared.\nVictoria also saw William and Alice, especially noticing his gaze, which made her feel instantly stiff.\nSensing her discomfort, Samuel patted her shoulder with a smile and whispered, \"Don't be afraid, I'm here. He won't eat you.\"\nThe small joke brought a light blush to Victoria's cheeks, making her feel much more relaxed.\nWilliam's eyes flashed with cold light as Alice took his arm and led him towards Victoria.\n\"Ms. Carter, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?\" Alice feigned concern.\nVictoria shook her head and forced a smile, \"I'm fine, just a bit sore in my feet.\"\nWilliam glanced at her feet and sneered, \"You're always getting sick or injured; it's surprising how fragile you are, given your ordinary status!\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together, not answering him, but her face turned much paler.\nAlice looked at Victoria and pretended to help, \"William, why do you always pick on Ms. Carter?\"\n\"I'm just telling the truth. She's not like you, a real lady of high status,\" William said with a mocking glance at Victoria.\nVictoria lowered her eyes, not refuting his sarcasm.\nBut her slightly trembling hands betrayed her thoughts.\nWilliam, what right do you have to belittle me like this! What right!\nSamuel noticed her distress and subtly held her tighter, coldly looking at William, \"Mr. Scott, everyone is equal. Please watch your words!\"\n\"Ms. Carter, Mr. Brown, don't mind him. Our William speaks harshly but has a kind heart. How's your foot? Do you need to go to the hospital?\" Alice asked with concern.\nVictoria shook her head and replied softly, \"No need, I'll rest for a bit, and it'll be fine later.\"\n\"In that case, I'll take you back to your room to rest and apply some medicine,\" Samuel suggested considerately.\nVictoria hesitated for a moment and then nodded lightly.\nWilliam's face instantly darkened even more.\nAlice smiled brightly, \"Then I'll trouble Mr. Brown to take good care of her. I booked a couple's suite for you two, you'll love it.\"\n\"A couple's suite?\" Victoria exclaimed.\nWilliam couldn't hold back, \"They're not even married! Book another room!\"\nAlice pouted, \"William, you're being unreasonable. What era is this? What's wrong with couples living together?\"\nWilliam was about to say something when Samuel spoke, \"Victoria, don't worry, I'll sleep on the couch tonight and take care of you.\"\nVictoria wanted to say something, but Alice looked at her with deep eyes, \"Ms. Carter, do you have a problem with that?\"\nVictoria bit her lip and remained silent.\nWilliam's face became even more unpleasant.\nAlice smiled sweetly, \"Alright then, it's decided. Mr. Brown, I'll have someone bring the medicine box and dinner to your room later.\"\nWith that, she pulled William out of the hall.\nWilliam remained silent, his face exceptionally cold.\nAlice clung to his arm, pretending to be gentle as she leaned against his chest, looking like a delicate bird.\nShe looked up at him and softly said, \"William, Ms. Carter has found her happiness, you should be happy for her, right?\"\nHer voice was gentle, but her tone carried a hint of probing.\nWilliam's eyes deepened upon hearing her voice, but he didn't answer.\nSeeing this, Alice's lips curled into a smile, \"Let's go back to our room.\"\nThe room was warm, and Samuel gently placed Victoria on the couch, took off her coat, and poured a cup of hot water, handing it to her.\nAfter drinking a cup of water, Victoria felt much better.\nShe was about to get up from the couch but was pressed back by Samuel.\n\"Victoria, you sit here, I'll apply the medicine for you,\" he said, then turned and went into the bedroom.\nA moment later, Samuel returned with a medicine box and a basin of hot water.\nHe bent down, half-kneeling in front of the couch, carefully taking off Victoria's shoes and socks to wash her feet.\n\"Samuel, I can do it myself,\" Victoria said, feeling a bit embarrassed.\nSamuel looked up and smiled at her, \"I want to be your most loyal knight.\"\nHearing his joke, Victoria couldn't help but laugh.\nSeeing her smile, Samuel's eyes flashed, and he playfully tapped her nose, \"Silly girl, you're smiling so sweetly.\"\nVictoria blushed and avoided his hand, lowering her head, not daring to look at him.\nSeeing her shy demeanor, Samuel's lips curved into a gentle smile.\nVictoria's skin was smooth, her feet delicate and tender, her toes round and full, looking particularly enticing.\nSamuel's throat moved slightly, his eyes filled with desire, and his fingers holding the towel turned a bit red.\nHe cleared his throat, trying to suppress the surge of desire within him, and soaked the towel in hot water, carefully rubbing Victoria's small feet.\nHis movements were extremely gentle, and Victoria's body gradually tensed.\nAlthough they didn't exchange any words, Victoria could feel his careful care.\nVictoria slightly turned her head, looking at the half-kneeling Samuel, his handsome features appearing even more charming under the warm yellow light.\nSamuel noticed her gaze, stopped his actions, and turned his head, meeting her eyes.\nVictoria quickly looked away, not daring to meet his gaze.\nSamuel smiled and wrung out the towel, \"All done.\"\nHe stood up, took the ointment, and gestured for her to extend her foot.\nVictoria hesitated for a few seconds, then extended her foot towards Samuel, letting him carefully apply the ointment.\nHis long fingers skillfully applied the ointment to her skin, each touch sending a current through her body.\nVictoria's body stiffened, not daring to move.\nSamuel looked up at Victoria, \"Does it hurt?\"\nVictoria quickly shook her head, \"N-no.\"\nSamuel looked at her slightly flushed cheeks and her sexy figure revealed after taking off her heavy coat, his throat burning, and an uncontrollable thought surged in his mind.\nVictoria noticed his intense gaze, her heart pounding, and even her ears turned red.\nSamuel felt a tingling sensation in his heart, which quickly became uncontrollable.\nHe raised his head and slowly leaned towards Victoria.",

He cursed under his breath and got up to open the door.\nWhen the door opened, there was a waiter standing outside with a dining cart.\nThe waiter glanced inside the room and politely nodded to the two of them, \"Hello, your dinner is ready. Please enjoy.\"\nSamuel nodded, stepped aside, and let the waiter in.\nWhen he returned to the room, Victoria had already regained her composure.\nSamuel sighed, feeling a bit regretful but also somewhat pleased that Victoria hadn't resisted.\nHe moved the food from the dining cart to the table and handed a bowl of soup to Victoria.\n\"Have something to eat first. You've had a long day,\" he said, his eyes filled with concern.\nVictoria didn't refuse and obediently took the bowl of soup, lowering her head to drink it.\nSamuel also sat beside her, acting as if nothing had happened.\nAfter dinner, Victoria excused herself to the bathroom to escape the awkward situation.\nShe leaned on the sink, staring at her reflection in the mirror. Her cheeks were still red, like ripe apples, incredibly enticing.\nShe touched her slightly warm face, took a deep breath, and forced herself to calm down.\nWhen Victoria came out of the bathroom, she found Samuel sitting on the sofa, drawing with the hotel's pencil and paper.\nWith a few strokes, he had sketched Victoria's smiling face while skiing, like a Winterberry blooming in winter.\nVictoria stared at the sketch, suddenly remembering the oil painting Samuel had given her before. It depicted her just as vividly and happily, like flowers blooming in spring.\nVictoria bit her lip and walked over to the sofa, looking down at Samuel.\nHe glanced up at Victoria, then continued to focus on his drawing.\nVictoria gazed at his serious profile, her eyes suddenly welling up with tears.\nDuring this time, Samuel had been so good to her that it made her feel like she was worthy of being loved!\n\"Why are you crying?\" Samuel put down the pencil and looked up at Victoria. \"Is the drawing not good?\"\nSamuel's voice was low and gentle, like the warm and comfortable sunshine in March.\nVictoria quickly blinked away her tears, forced a smile, and said, \"It's beautiful.\"\nSamuel smiled, reached out his hand, and brushed her bangs away from her forehead, revealing her smooth and full forehead.\nVictoria stared blankly at his face, feeling a flutter in her heart.\nSuddenly, she thought of William.\nIf only he could be this gentle.\nSamuel seemed to sense Victoria's distraction, a hint of sadness flashed in his eyes, but it quickly disappeared.\nHe playfully pinched Victoria's delicate nose and said indulgently, \"Don't overthink it. You've had a long day. Get some sleep.\"\n\"What about you?\" Victoria asked hesitantly.\n\"I'll sleep later,\" Samuel said, taking a blanket and pillow to the sofa and smiling at Victoria.\nHearing this, Victoria sighed in relief, lay down on the bed, and closed her eyes.\nSamuel looked at Victoria on the bed, his eyes dark and unreadable. After a long while, he took a bathrobe and headed to the bathroom.\nVictoria suddenly felt unbearably hot in her sleep, as if a fire was burning inside her.\nShe woke up abruptly, her cheeks flushed, her whole body tender and alluring.\nWhat was going on? Why was she feeling like this?\n\"Victoria!\" Samuel stood at the door, his voice hoarse.\nVictoria hurriedly pulled the blanket over herself, her voice trembling, \"W-what's wrong?\"\n\"Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?\"\nVictoria bit her lip, trying to steady her emotions, \"You, you rest first. I'm fine.\"\n\"I know you're feeling bad right now. Our food might have been drugged,\" Samuel explained.\n\"What should we do?\" Victoria panicked, clutching her chest, feeling increasingly unbearable.\nShe didn't need to guess who did this.\nAlice was determined to make her stay away from William.\n\"Can I come in?\"\n\"No, no!\" Victoria responded softly, her voice trembling uncontrollably.\nSamuel paused at the door for a moment, but in the end, his rationality couldn't overcome his desire. He pushed the door open and walked in.\nSeeing his figure, Victoria blushed even more.\nShe clasped her legs together, her fists pressed against her knees, her eyes wandering, looking pitiful.\nSamuel looked at her, feeling parched.\nVictoria bit her lip, feeling her sanity slipping away, a deep desire welling up inside her.\n\"Let me help you,\" Samuel said, stepping forward, holding Victoria's cold hand, and pulling her into his arms.\nVictoria struggled a few times but ultimately couldn't resist her body's instincts.\nSamuel held Victoria tightly, kissing her red lips, prying open her teeth to taste her sweetness, savoring the flavor in her mouth.\nGradually, Samuel's breathing became heavy.\nHis large hand climbed up Victoria's slender waist.\nVictoria let out a soft moan, collapsing into Samuel's arms.\nSamuel's long-suppressed desire exploded in an instant, pressing Victoria onto the bed.\n\"Victoria, I want you,\" his voice was low, his eyes red.\nVictoria, tormented by the drug, was groggy, unable to respond to Samuel's words.\n\"Victoria, I like you, really like you, more than William,\" Samuel whispered in her ear, his voice hoarse.\nHis fingers roamed over Victoria's delicate skin, each touch making her body tremble slightly.\n\"I know I shouldn't take advantage of you, but I can't control myself. Victoria, please, let me be your man. I'll treat you well, for the rest of my life.\"\nIn her daze, Victoria heard Samuel's words, but she couldn't comprehend them.\nSamuel leaned down, kissing Victoria's forehead, cheeks, and neck.\nVictoria's body writhed, overwhelmed by the surging desire inside her, her head buzzing.\nShe grabbed Samuel's collar, tilting her small chin, and kissed his lips.\nVictoria's initiative thrilled Samuel.\nHer actions were like a powerful catalyst for Samuel.\nHe flipped Victoria over, pinning her beneath him, kissing her passionately.\nWhen her sexy body was exposed to the air, Victoria finally regained a bit of consciousness.\nShe screamed, using all her strength to push Samuel away, rolling to the side and curling up.\nSamuel was hurt by Victoria's resolute attitude, feeling heartbroken.\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you,\" he said, looking at her apologetically.\nVictoria's mind was foggy, knowing she couldn't stay here any longer, or the consequences would be unimaginable.\nShe struggled to get up from the floor, hastily put on her coat, and rushed out of the room.\nSamuel watched Victoria's panicked escape, his heart aching as if it was about to break.\nSamuel slowly crouched down, holding his head in his hands, in deep pain.",

It's my fault, I didn't protect you.\"\nVictoria lay on his shoulder, sobbing.\nWilliam picked her up and walked towards the campsite next to the hotel.\nThe tents here were more like small cabins, surrounded by snow-covered pine trees, looking very beautiful.\nVictoria lay on the mat, her misty eyes half-closed, her long hair scattered on the pillow.\n\"William!\" she murmured, her voice soft and tender.\nWilliam leaned down to her ear, intimately licking her ear.\nVictoria shyly squirmed, her body involuntarily curling up like a shrimp.\nWilliam's eyes darkened, his hand reaching into her clothes, kneading her soft skin.\n\"William!\" Victoria panted, her cheeks flushed, she grabbed William's hand tightly, looking at him with pleading eyes.\nWilliam knew what she wanted, and he wanted it too.\nBut without proper lubrication, she could get hurt.\n\"Be good, Victoria!\" William patiently coaxed her, \"Or you'll get hurt.\"",

He pushed Victoria down onto the bed, skillfully removing all her clothes.\nHer sexy body was displayed in front of him, causing him to swallow hard and feel an unbearable ache in his lower body.\nVictoria moaned softly, her petite breasts standing erect in the air, trembling with her movements.\nWilliam buried his face in her neck, his heavy breathing spraying onto her sensitive skin, causing an unusual tickling sensation.\nHis hands roamed over her body, leaving traces behind.\nShe couldn't help but twist her waist, matching his rhythm, moaning out loud.\nHis lips sucked on her collarbone, occasionally nibbling, leaving intimate marks.\nVictoria moaned in discomfort, her body's reactions faster than her brain. Her hands grabbed his clothes, almost wanting to tear them apart.\nWilliam slowly moved his hand down her slender waist, caressing her flat, soft belly, and continued to slide down.\nWhen he touched a wet spot, Victoria suddenly opened her hazy eyes, her cheeks tinged with a faint blush.\nShe stretched out her legs, hooking them around William's waist, pressing her body closer.\n\"William!\" she gently stroked William's chest.\n\"Good girl, relax,\" William coaxed her, his hand slowly moving to her private area, his fingers teasing.\nVictoria's small mouth let out an extremely enticing low moan, her body becoming increasingly wet with desire, as if about to be overwhelmed by her own arousal.\nShe closed her eyes, enjoying William's caresses.\nWilliam's kisses slowly landed on her lips, his tongue skillfully slipping into her mouth.\nVictoria was aroused to the extreme, hugging William's back, tilting her neck, enduring his demands and invasions.\nWilliam's large hand grasped her breast, while the other hand held her slender waist.\nHe gently lifted her legs, sliding his penis between her thighs.\nVictoria's hands clung to his broad, firm shoulders, her legs tightening around his waist.\nShe felt William's penis rubbing between her legs, and she couldn't help but moan out loud.\nWilliam pressed his forehead against hers, his voice hoarse and sexy, \"Baby, do you like it?\"\nVictoria murmured softly, her body completely paralyzed.\nWilliam could no longer suppress his desire. He flipped Victoria over, forcing her to straddle his waist.\nTheir hot bodies intertwined, rubbing against each other.\nWilliam lifted her hips, thrusting his body inside, taking her fiercely.\nVictoria couldn't help but cry out.\nWilliam smiled in satisfaction, his large hand gently kneading her soft buttocks.\nEach of his thrusts precisely hit Victoria's sensitive spots, making her shiver all over, her body tense, and her throat letting out pleasurable moans.\nListening to her soul-stirring moans, William felt his blood boiling.\nHe pounded into her wildly, as if he wanted to devour her completely.\nVictoria clung to him tightly, letting his rhythm wash over every part of her body.\nTheir naked bodies tangled together, sweat dripping onto each other.\nJust as they were immersed in the moment, a familiar voice called out from outside.\n\"Victoria! Where did you go? Come back!\" Samuel's voice came from not far away.\nHe had taken a cold shower to calm down a bit.\nAlthough he was a bit hurt by Victoria's escape, he was more worried about her safety at the moment.\nIt was freezing cold on the mountain, and she was dressed so thinly, without her phone.\nWhat if something happened to her?\n\"William, let me down!\" Victoria urged him, her voice anxious, afraid that Samuel would discover them in this state.\n\"Don't move!\" William ordered fiercely.\nVictoria didn't dare to disobey him, staying still and even breathing carefully.\nSamuel quickly arrived at their door, and Victoria could see Samuel's figure through the gap in the window.\nSeeing how much Victoria cared about Samuel's feelings, William felt a surge of jealousy, thrusting his hips heavily.\nVictoria couldn't help but let out a muffled groan.\nSamuel heard Victoria's voice and hesitated, standing in front of the tent with a frown.\n\"Victoria! Are you in there?\" Samuel called out loudly.\n\"Samuel, you should go back!\" Victoria suppressed her voice, trying to sound calm and not let Samuel notice anything unusual.\n\"Victoria!\" Samuel's tone carried a hint of urgency and worry. He continued to ask, \"Victoria, are you okay?\"\nWilliam's large hand gripped Victoria's slender waist, not allowing her to be distracted.\nVictoria gritted her teeth, shaking her head, and forced herself to say calmly, \"I'm fine, I'll sleep here tonight.\"\n\"Are you really okay? You sounded a bit off just now.\" Samuel was skeptical.\nWilliam maliciously pinched Victoria's breast, causing her to panic. She quickly explained, \"I-I'm really fine!\"\nSamuel furrowed his brows, saying with concern, \"Victoria, if you're not feeling well, don't push yourself. Tell me, and I'll take you to the hospital for a check-up.\"\nThe more William listened, the angrier he became. He decided not to hold back anymore and thrust deeply into Victoria.\nVictoria cried out in surprise, instinctively hugging William's back.\n\"Victoria, what's wrong?\" Samuel asked nervously.\n\"N-nothing,\" Victoria's face turned red, stammering, \"Just a bug. You should go back, I need to rest.\"\nSamuel seemed to sense something. He paused for a few seconds, then said nothing more and turned to leave.\nSamuel's footsteps gradually faded away. Confirming he had completely left, William finally withdrew from Victoria's body.\nVictoria lay on the edge of the bed, panting heavily, drenched in sweat.\nWilliam's fluids still lingered inside her, warm and burning.\nHer eyes were misty, making William react again.\nWilliam's large hand covered her small hand, guiding it to his penis.\nVictoria gasped in fright, struggling to pull her hand back, \"No!\"\nWilliam let out a low, hoarse laugh.\nVictoria glared at him with wide eyes, angrily saying, \"You... let go of my hand.\"\nWilliam laughed wickedly, his large hand wrapping around her slender fingers, slowly pressing.\nVictoria's body trembled uncontrollably, the stimulation too intense, almost driving her crazy.\n\"Victoria!\" William leaned down, sucking on Victoria's nipple, gently licking.\nVictoria was tormented by him, feeling an increasing emptiness in her just-satisfied body.",

        "content": "William caught sight of her excitement swelling once more and couldn't resist leaning in for another passionate encounter.\nIt wasn't until Victoria was utterly spent that William finally released her.\nVictoria fell into a deep sleep. William helped her tidy up her disheveled long hair and wiped her body with a warm towel.\nThen he held her and fell asleep peacefully.\nWhen she woke up, it was already morning. The morning light shone into the room, filling it with brightness.\nVictoria turned her head to look at William. His handsome profile came into her view, and she couldn't help but reach out to touch his well-defined brows, high nose, and sexy thin lips.\nVictoria slowly leaned in and gently kissed the corner of William's lips.\nWilliam suddenly opened his deep eyes and met Victoria's clear and bright pupils.\nVictoria was stunned.\n\"Morning!\" she greeted plainly.\n\"Morning!\" William lazily squinted his eyes, his long index finger lightly touching her rosy lips, his voice magnetic and seductive.\n\"I'm hungry again!\" William suddenly said.\nHis deep, husky voice made her cheeks flush. She knew what kind of hunger he was talking about.\nThis man was too greedy, never getting enough.\nJust as Victoria was lost in thought, there was a knock on the door.\n\"William, didn't you say there was something at the company? We should go.\" Alice's gentle voice sounded at the door.\nVictoria's originally flushed cheeks instantly turned pale.\nWhat if Alice knew she had been with William again? Thinking of the police station's interrogation lights and cold handcuffs, Victoria couldn't help but shiver.\nWilliam also frowned, got up, and started getting dressed, replying, \"Wait a moment, I'll be right out.\"\nVictoria hurriedly started getting dressed too, but she was so weak that her movements were slow.\nWilliam glanced at her, said nothing, and closed the door as he stepped out.\nAlice acted as if nothing had happened, smiling and saying, \"William, I bought you breakfast. Eat it while it's hot.\"\n\"Okay,\" William said indifferently, glancing at the bag in Alice's hand. \"Let's go back to the hotel to eat. It's cold here.\"\nHe said this while pulling her arm to leave.\nAlice smiled and held him back, \"Why are you in such a hurry to leave, William? We haven't finished our business.\"\nWilliam's face darkened, and he said sternly, \"What else do you want to do?\"\nHis tone was heavy, but Alice wasn't angry at all. She placed the bag in his hand and turned to open the door again.\nVictoria happened to be coming out of the room, and their eyes met. Victoria couldn't help but gasp.\nAlice had a smile on her lips, while Victoria stood stiffly, at a loss.\nAlice's eyes swept over Victoria's messy hair and her body that was covered in kiss marks, her gaze deep.\n\"Ms. Garcia, don't misunderstand. Last night I...\"\nVictoria tried to explain, but Alice waved her hand to interrupt.\n\"It's okay, it was just an accident. William knows I'm weak and didn't want to hurt me, so he came to you for relief. In families like ours, having a few maids to satisfy his desires is quite common!\"\nVictoria's face instantly turned pale. She stared at Alice in shock, unable to speak.\nThis sentence was undoubtedly a disguised way of calling her a prostitute.\n\"Ms. Garcia, you!\" Victoria was so angry she couldn't speak.\n\"Ms. Carter, don't be mad. I won't let you suffer a loss.\" Alice said as she took out a check from her pocket and handed it to Victoria. \"After all, you're not a maid of the Scott family. Here's $100,000 as compensation.\"\nVictoria was so angry that her body trembled. She looked at William, only to find that he was indifferent, letting Alice humiliate her.\nSeeing that she was reluctant to take the check, Alice smiled and urged, \"What's wrong? Ms. Carter, do you think it's not enough?\"\nShe deliberately dragged out her words, her eyes full of provocation.\n\"No, it's not necessary.\" Victoria lowered her head, her hands clenched into fists, her eyes stinging with tears.\nWilliam saw Victoria's aggrieved look and felt a slight pang in his heart. But seeing Alice's expression, he knew that if he defended Victoria now, Alice would go even crazier.\nThinking of the medical report the doctor had given him earlier, William's expression turned gloomy. He looked up at Victoria and said, \"Since Alice gave it to you, take it.\"\nVictoria was shocked and looked up at William.\nShe thought William would at least argue for her, but he was helping Alice humiliate her.\nAt this moment, Victoria felt a suffocating pain in her chest, a wave of dizziness, and she almost fell.\nWilliam's eyes flashed with a trace of reluctance, but he quickly turned away.\nAlice smiled smugly and said, \"Ms. Carter, I remember your mother's medical bills were paid by William. You accepted his money, so why not mine?\"\nShe finished speaking and stuffed the check into Victoria's hand, then turned to William and said coquettishly, \"William, let's go!\"\nWilliam glanced at Victoria's pale face and said nothing.\nThe two left together.\nWatching them leave, Victoria squatted down and cried.\nThis scene was seen by someone in the corner.\nHe clenched his fists, wanting to comfort her, but his feet felt like they were filled with lead and couldn't move.\nFinally, he sighed helplessly and turned to leave.\nVictoria squatted on the ground and cried for a long time. Finally, she stood up and smiled bitterly.\n\"Fool, what are you expecting? Hasn't he always treated you this way?\n'In his eyes, haven't you always been a toy for his sexual needs? How pathetic!\"\nWith that, Victoria bitterly smiled, wiped away her tears, and forced herself to return to the hotel room to pack her things and leave.\nWhen she entered, Samuel was already gone.\nVictoria didn't regret running away last night, but she still felt very sorry for him.\nVictoria saw the sketch Samuel had drawn of her on the table and couldn't help but pick it up.\nIn the sketch, she was still smiling brightly, a stark contrast to her now red and swollen eyes from crying.\nBut there was an extra line of words on the sketch compared to last night's: \"Victoria, are you really happy with him? No matter what, I just want you to be happy.\"\nVictoria's heart suddenly ached, and she cried even harder, this time out of guilt. \nShe sniffed and picked up her phone to call Samuel.\nNo one answered, so she called again, but still, no one answered.\nAfter putting down the phone, she walked out of the hotel in a daze, only to run into William and Alice at the door.",

He pressed his thin lips together and finally decided to stride after her.\nAlice stood there in a daze for a while, looking at his tall and upright figure, her lips curling into a mocking smile.\nWilliam grabbed Victoria's hand, \"Don't be stubborn. It's so early, there are no cars at the foot of the mountain to take you back to the city!\"\nVictoria shook off his hand and stubbornly said, \"Thank you, Mr. Scott, but there's no need to trouble you. I'll take the bus back.\"\nWilliam furrowed his brows, seeing her attitude, he didn't bother to argue. He let go of her hand, but when he saw her stumble a few steps and almost fall, he quickly supported her.\nHer hand was cold and weak, her whole body trembling slightly.\n\"Victoria!\"\n\"Mr. Scott, please leave me alone. I'm really fine. All I ask is that you and your girlfriend stay away from me. I've had enough,\" Victoria murmured.\nHearing her mention the word \"girlfriend,\" William's face darkened instantly, his voice low and tinged with anger, \"Victoria, do you have to be like this?\"\nVictoria closed her eyes, refusing to look at him, and coldly said, \"Please, Mr. Scott, show some respect. We have nothing to do with each other anymore!\"\nAfter speaking, without waiting for William's reaction, she pushed him away and walked straight ahead.\nShe walked faster and faster, just in time to catch a cable car that was about to depart, squeezing herself in.\nThe cable car seat held only her.\nVictoria closed her eyes and leaned back in the seat, unable to tell if she felt more sadness or anger, or perhaps both.\nShe took out her phone and blocked all of William's contacts.\nWilliam watched that lonely, slender figure, his heart inexplicably aching, as if someone had torn it apart.\nHis gaze gradually darkened, a complex emotion flashing in his eyes.\nAfter returning from Snowflake Peak, Victoria fell ill, suffering from a severe fever and cough.\nShe took some medicine, insisted on going to work during the day, and went to the hospital for IV drips at night.\nWendy felt extremely sorry for her seeing her like this.\nShe took the initiative to accompany her to the hospital every day, taking care of her and making food for her.\nUnder her care, Victoria quickly recovered.\nShe put all the unpleasant things behind her and focused all her energy on work.\nIt was time to pick up a painting from Samuel's studio.\nSamuel had previously agreed to send a painting to Starry Studio Gallery for consignment every month.\nDiana was urging her to go and get it.\nSince the trip to Snowflake Peak, the two had not contacted each other, not even a single message.\nVictoria took a few deep breaths, trying to suppress the strange feeling in her heart.\nAlthough she still felt very awkward, for the sake of work, she had to force herself to find Samuel.\nShe hesitated for a moment outside the studio before ringing the doorbell.\nSoon, the door opened.\nThe person who opened the door was Ryan, whom Victoria had met once. He was wearing loose sportswear, revealing his strong, muscular waist and sexy abs.\nWhen Ryan saw that it was Victoria at the door, his expression stiffened slightly, then returned to normal, asking, \"What are you doing here?\"\nVictoria opened her mouth, not knowing what to say for a moment.\n\"Come in!\" he said, stepping aside to let Victoria in.\n\"I'm looking for Samuel. Is he not here?\"\nRyan's fingers twitched slightly, and he said nonchalantly, \"If you're his girlfriend, I'll call him out for you. If you're not, then don't waste each other's time!\"\nHearing this, Victoria's cheeks flushed, and she lowered her gaze, softly saying, \"Sorry to bother you!\" She then turned to leave.\nSeeing that she was really leaving, Ryan quickly called out to her. After hesitating for a moment, he finally relented, \"Fine, you're here to pick up a painting, right? He's prepared it for you!\"\nVictoria was stunned for a moment, then looked up at Ryan.\nRyan crossed his arms and nodded slightly, \"Aren't you going? Do you want me to carry you there?\"\nVictoria's cheeks heated up, and she quickly walked a few steps forward, walking beside Ryan, heading to the third-floor storage room where the paintings were kept.\nRyan handed her the painting Samuel had prepared, his tone flat, \"You can go now. Don't come looking for him again.\"\nHearing this, Victoria suddenly looked up, her eyes instantly welling up with tears, \"Is he still mad at me?\"\nRyan sneered, looking at her coldly, \"How could he be mad at you? He's mad at himself.\"\nRyan sighed, \"I've known him since we were kids. I've never seen him care so much about any girl. I've never seen him so heartbroken over anyone. You're the only one. He loves you very much, you should understand that.\"\nVictoria bit her lip, \"I'm not good enough for him! He deserves better!\"\nHearing her say this, Ryan became even angrier, his tone becoming much more serious, \"Whether you're good enough or not isn't for you to decide. And I believe he cherishes you more than anyone else, doesn't he? Look, what are these?\"\nRyan walked to the side and pulled back the curtain covering the paintings, revealing a large pile of paintings, all of different versions of Victoria-happy, sad, shy, and so on.\nAll of them were of her.\n\"These were all painted by him,\" he said.\nVictoria stared blankly at the paintings in front of her, a crystal tear sliding down her cheek. She raised her hand to wipe away the tear.\nRyan took a few steps closer, bent down, and took a tissue from his pocket, handing it to her, his voice gentle, \"He really likes you. He said you're the only girl in the world who can make him feel calm and peaceful.\"\nVictoria's eyes were moist, and she choked out, \"Where did he go?\"\n\"He went to the polar regions to see the aurora. He originally wanted to take you with him during your annual leave, but it seems you hurt him pretty badly this time. He said he wanted to give you time to think it over. If you ultimately choose not to be with him, he will still wish you happiness,\" Ryan said with a bitter smile.\nHearing this, Victoria's heart tightened.\n\"I understand. Thank you for telling me!\" she said, then turned and quickly ran away.\nRyan watched her back and sighed deeply, feeling sorry for Samuel.\nHe really didn't understand what Victoria was thinking. Samuel was mature, handsome, and talented. How could he not compare to the fickle William?\nDid all women have a masochistic streak?\nDid they all like scoundrels and jerks?\nAfter placing the painting back in the gallery, Victoria took the subway home in a daze.\nWhen she was almost home, she saw a new barbecue restaurant had opened at the entrance of her community. She suddenly wanted to drink.\nVictoria ordered some skewers and a dozen beers, drinking, crying, and laughing, like a madwoman.\nVictoria got completely drunk.\nShe took out her phone from her bag and dialed Samuel's number.\nShe couldn't get through.\nOf course, he was watching the aurora now. How could he answer her call?\nVictoria hung up and asked the owner for another dozen beers, continuing to drink.\nVictoria's mind was filled with images of Samuel and those paintings.\nAt the table next to her, a few middle-aged men were also drunk, and their eyes soon fell on Victoria.",

Let me join you.\"\nVictoria was taken aback and slightly raised her head. The strong smell of alcohol prevented her from realizing the danger in front of her. She instinctively waved her hand, \"I don't need it, thank you.\"\n\"How could you not need it? Such a beautiful girl should have someone to drink with!\" Another man chimed in, a mysterious smile playing on his lips.\nVictoria felt a wave of discomfort and irritation. She wanted to avoid them but was surrounded by their laughter and teasing.\nShe tried to stand up but lost her balance due to her drunkenness and almost fell.\n\"Stay away from me!\" Victoria glared at them, but this only provoked more laughter.\nThe owner of the barbecue restaurant couldn't stand it anymore and wanted to intervene, but one of the men stopped him, \"Mind your own business, or you'll regret it.\"\nThe owner shrank back in fear.\nThe other customers in the restaurant didn't dare to make a sound, afraid of getting involved.\n\"Miss, you're so thin, drinking is bad for your health. If you get a stomachache, I'll feel terrible.\" The man with the fleshy face reached out to touch Victoria's cheek, his rough palm rubbing against her delicate skin.\nVictoria recoiled in disgust and slapped his hand away.\n\"You bitch! How dare you!\" The man was furious and raised his hand to slap Victoria.\nVictoria retreated several steps, and just as the man was about to strike, a dark shadow loomed over him, blocking his way. A fist landed heavily on his nose, causing him to clutch his nose in pain and scream.\nWilliam kicked him to the ground, stepping on his chest, and said coldly, \"Get lost!\"\n\"You bitch, how dare you hit me?\" The man struggled to get up and swung his arm at William, but William caught his wrist, causing him to feel a bone-crushing pain.\nHe screamed in agony, his face contorted with pain.\nSeeing this, his companions grabbed chairs or bottles and threw them at William. William kicked the chairs away and then picked two up, mercilessly smashing it on them.\nCries of pain echoed around. William walked towards the man clutching his nose.\nSensing danger, the man tried to run.\nWith a loud crash, his bulky body hit the wall, and he fell to the ground, groaning in pain.\nWilliam stepped on his chest and said coldly, \"You're lucky tonight. If I see you again, you won't be so fortunate!\"\nWith that, he released his foot and helped Victoria up from the ground.\nHer eyes were red, and tears stained her face, making her look very pitiful.\nA hint of heartache flashed in William's eyes.\nVictoria opened her eyes in a daze, staring blankly at William.\nWilliam squatted beside her, placing his hands on her shoulders, \"What's wrong? Don't you recognize me?\"\nVictoria stared at him for a moment, then threw herself into his arms.\n\"Dad, they were bullying me,\" Victoria mumbled, hugging William and crying loudly.\nWilliam's hand paused, then he patted her back and sighed helplessly, \"There, there, don't cry.\"\nVictoria buried her head in his chest, inhaling his familiar scent, and gradually stopped crying.\nAfter a while, Victoria looked up at William and suddenly asked, \"Dad, did I do something wrong to make you angry? Tell me, I'll change! Please don't leave me again.\"\nWilliam was silent for a moment. As he carried her on his back, he said, \"You didn't do anything wrong. It was my fault.\"\nVictoria blinked in confusion, letting William carry her.\nShe nestled on William's warm, broad back, closed her eyes, and took a deep breath, feeling comforted by his familiar scent.\n\"Dad, where did you go? I missed you so much. I thought you didn't want me anymore. I was so scared.\"\n\"I'm sorry for making you suffer.\"\nVictoria leaned on his back, swaying gently, \"Dad, you can't lie to me. I really missed you. Mom only likes Bobby. She...\"\nThinking of Nora, Victoria's tears welled up again, \"Dad, I'm so tired and exhausted.\"\nShe choked and sobbed, her tears soaking William's coat.\nHis breathing became uneven, and his heart ached.\nVictoria wrapped her arms around William's neck, \"Dad, I want to go back to school, but I can't. Mom needs to be hospitalized, and Bobby needs to go to school. You told me to stay out of her and Bobby's business, but Mom said if I don't give her money, she'll go to the media and expose my relationship with William.\"\nVictoria cried even harder, her eyes swollen and sore, tears streaming down like a river breaking its banks. She cried so hard it was heart-wrenching.\n\"Dad, I've embarrassed you. I'm a bad girl. I sold myself for money. That Alice even called me a prostitute.\"\nThe more Victoria spoke, the more upset and aggrieved she felt.\nIt was as if she was venting all the pent-up emotions from so long. She became more and more agitated, eventually crying so hard she could barely breathe.\nWilliam's heart tightened. He quickly carried her back to her home, took the key from her bag, and opened the door.\nHe gently placed her on the sofa, poured her a glass of water, and handed it to her.\n\"Drink some water first, don't cry.\" William coaxed softly.\nVictoria held the warm cup, her eyes downcast, not speaking.\nWilliam sat beside her, gently rubbing her long hair, speaking softly, \"Don't cry. I'll teach them a lesson for you, okay?\"\nVictoria slowly looked up, her eyes red and swollen, and suddenly jumped into his arms, \"Dad, you know what? I drove away the only person who really cared about me.\"\nWilliam's body stiffened slightly at the word \"only.\"\nVictoria continued to cling to him like a cat seeking shelter.\nWilliam sighed, picked her up, walked to the bed, and laid her down, covering her with a blanket. He then said softly, \"Sleep.\"\nHis voice was gentle and doting, making it hard not to be drawn in.\n\"Okay.\" Victoria responded, pulling the blanket over her head.\nWilliam turned off the light and was about to leave.\nVictoria grabbed his hand, crying, \"Dad, don't go!\"\nWilliam's body trembled, then he leaned down and kissed her forehead, \"Okay.\"\nHe then took off his coat, lay down on the bed, and held Victoria in his arms, gently patting her back, \"There, there, sleep. I'm not going anywhere.\"\nFeeling William's presence, Victoria felt much more at ease and soon fell asleep.\nA faint smile of happiness and contentment appeared on her lips.\nWilliam looked at her sweet face, his eyes deepening, and his throat felt dry.\nSince the last time at Snowflake Peak, it had been almost a month since he had made love.\nNow, with her lying in his arms, her cute and charming sleeping face so close, his body felt hot, and a certain part of him began to stir.\nWilliam swallowed, forcing himself to look away, but he couldn't control his growing desire.\nVictoria felt a bit cold and murmured, instinctively moving closer to the heat source, mumbling, \"So warm.\"\nThis low moan acted like a catalyst, causing William to completely lose control. He took the initiative and sealed Victoria's incessant lips with his own.",

She wanted more!\nWilliam's hands roamed over her body, caressing her, causing her to tremble.\nVictoria opened her hazy eyes, seeing the blurry outline of the man in front of her.\nShe couldn't help but moan.\nWilliam's body tensed, his eyes turning red.\nHis fingers skillfully intertwined between her legs, grabbing her buttocks and moving rhythmically.\nVictoria's feet clamped tightly around William's waist, her whole body curling up.\nVictoria's body was very sensitive. With each stimulation from William, she trembled all over, her hands gripping his shoulders tightly, her knuckles turning white.\nWilliam's eyes darkened as he saw her expression.\nVictoria moaned in discomfort. William lifted her legs, spreading them apart, straightening his waist.\nVictoria felt a strange stimulation, her body instantly tensing.\nWilliam grunted, thrusting into her forcefully.\nVictoria felt the liquid inside her slowly seeping out, flowing down her legs.\nSeeing this, William's eyes grew even darker. He held Victoria's slender waist, flipping her over, making her lie on the bed with her buttocks facing him.\nHe knelt on one knee on the bed, his long fingers pinching her buttocks, gently pushing.\nVictoria closed her eyes, enduring the pleasure he gave her.\nWilliam looked at Victoria's flushed cheeks and seductive lips beneath him, a trace of heat flashing in his eyes.\nVictoria's mouth was slightly open, panting continuously.\nHe buried his head in her neck, deeply inhaling her unique fragrance.\nVictoria, drunk and dazed, rubbed against his body, murmuring, \"Not enough.\"\nHer soft, sweet voice reached William's bones, making him want to devour her immediately.\n\"Victoria, call me 'darling',\" William coaxed by her ear.\nVictoria opened her eyes in confusion, looking at William's handsome features, a trace of bewilderment in her eyes. She murmured, \"Darling!\"\n\"Yes,\" William's lips curved into a satisfied smile. He pressed Victoria beneath him again, taking her forcefully.\nHe thrust wildly, each movement seeming to break through the shackles of body and soul.\nVictoria, unable to think under his thrusts, could only follow his rhythm.\nHis body was as hard as iron, each thrust like an electric current running through her body. She felt like she was about to die.\nShe clung to him, her legs wrapped around his strong waist, letting him manipulate her. She felt pleasure, enjoying this feeling that made her forget all pain, wanting only to merge with him.\nFeeling her initiative, William ravaged her even more vigorously, his actions brutal and domineering, full of aggression.\nVictoria moaned in discomfort, her body growing wetter, her hands tightly gripping his hair, wanting more.\nWilliam roared, finally releasing his semen inside her.\nVictoria lay limp in his arms, motionless, her body aching, even her arms too weak to lift.\nShe squinted her hazy eyes, looking at the familiar face beneath her, suddenly feeling a bit dazed, as if she had returned to twenty years ago.\n\"Darling!\" she murmured.\nWilliam looked down at the beautiful, trembling Victoria in his arms, her body still shaking from pleasure.\n\"Victoria, who am I?\" he asked in a hoarse voice.\nStill drunk, Victoria frowned and said, \"You're William, my sweetheart.\"\nHer words filled William's eyes with intense desire, his penis erecting again.\nBut seeing her exhausted face, he restrained himself, instead fetching a warm towel to wipe her body and dressing her in clean pajamas.\nOnly after she fell asleep did he leave the room.\nWilliam stood at the door, lighting a cigarette, leaning against the wall to smoke.\nAfter a long time, he glanced at Victoria's door, then turned and left.\nWhen Victoria woke up, it was already light outside.\nShe felt not only a headache but also like her whole body had been run over, her limbs aching.\nShe only remembered drinking a lot last night and then passing out. As for what happened afterward, she couldn't recall at all.\nShe lifted the quilt to look at her body. Apart from some bruises, there were no other injuries.\nDid she get drunk and fall on her way home?\nShe tried to recall last night's events but couldn't remember anything.\nForget it, it didn't matter.\nShe got dressed, ready to go to work, when her phone suddenly rang. She glanced at the number.\nIt was Samuel calling.\nVictoria felt like something was stuck in her chest, her throat tightening.\nAfter a moment of silence, Victoria pressed the answer button, and Samuel's familiar, gentle voice came through the phone.\n\"Victoria, I was at the polar region last night, no signal, so I missed your call.\"\nVictoria instantly felt her face flush. Did she call Samuel when she was drunk last night?\nHer heart raced. She bit her lip, pretending to be calm, and said, \"No, it's nothing!\"\nSamuel paused for a moment, then asked in a low voice, \"Did you call me for something?\"\nVictoria bit her lip, unsure how to respond. After hesitating for a while, she said, \"I, I just dialed the wrong number, it's nothing. I'll hang up now, I'm getting ready.\"\nSamuel didn't say anything more, just responded, \"Okay.\"\nThen both of them fell silent, neither speaking again.\nJust as Victoria was about to hang up, Samuel suddenly said, \"Victoria, I won't be attending your award ceremony.\"",

Your work for the competition won the gold medal.\"\n\"Really?\" Victoria exclaimed in surprise. She hadn't expected that the work she had given up hope on would actually win an award.\n\"Yes, congratulations,\" Samuel said with a smile.\n\"Thank you, Samuel.\" At this moment, Victoria had forgotten the awkward relationship between them.\n\"Victoria,\" Samuel paused for a few seconds and then said, \"I need to sketch from my surroundings now, so I'll hang up now. Take care.\"\n\"Okay.\" Victoria paused for a moment and then hung up the phone.\nSamuel held his phone, standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, looking at the distant blue sky. A self-deprecating smile flickered across his lips.\nHe tossed the phone onto the table, picked up a paintbrush, and began working on a new piece.\nThe award ceremony was on Saturday evening. Victoria rented a gown, did her own makeup and hair, and then headed to the venue.\nTonight's award ceremony was grand, with celebrities from all walks of life and extensive media coverage.\nVictoria sat in the audience, scanning the room. She not only saw Diana but also William and Alice.\nOf course, William was not only the owner of the largest media company in Silvermist City but also the second-largest shareholder of Starry Studio Gallery. Naturally, he would be invited. Their presence here was not surprising.\nVictoria's gaze finally settled on William.\nHe was wearing a white suit, his tall figure looking even more imposing.\nHis expression was indifferent, his demeanor elegant and noble, exuding an innate aristocratic aura.\nAlice, holding his arm, was all smiles, and the two of them were the focus of everyone's envy.\nVictoria felt a pang of bitterness. Seeing Alice's happy demeanor and remembering her previous insults, Victoria felt a tightness in her chest.\nShe forced herself to look away.\nAt that moment, a familiar figure entered through the door.\nBobby!\nWhy was he here too?\nShe widened her eyes in surprise.\nBobby also saw Victoria, but he wasn't surprised. A mocking smile appeared on his lips as he walked to the seat next to her, pulled the chair aside, and sat directly opposite her.\nVictoria frowned slightly. She really disliked his arrogant demeanor and wondered where he got his confidence from.\n\"Victoria, long time no see!\" Bobby said in a sarcastic tone.\n\"Long time no see, Bobby!\" Victoria's eyes coldly stared at Bobby.\nNow, she felt an inexplicable aversion to him.\nBobby sneered, \"You'd better not get involved with me. I don't want your scandals affecting me.\"\nVictoria snorted coldly, \"Who do you think you are? A thief!\"\nBobby's face darkened, and he glared at Victoria, \"What nonsense are you spouting?\"\n\"Isn't it true? You stole my painting. Aren't you a thief?\" Victoria retorted.\n\"Victoria, shut up!\" Bobby looked around and growled.\nVictoria raised her chin, glaring at him provocatively, \"Who are you to yell at me? Bobby, you're despicable. The work you submitted for the national competition was stolen from me. Are you here to receive an award for another stolen piece today?\"\n\"You're unreasonable! I don't want to waste my breath on you! We'll see.\" Bobby glared at Victoria and turned away.\nVictoria sneered, \"Bobby, I'm telling you, this is the last time I'll tolerate you. If you steal my painting or frame me again, I'll take you down with me!\"\n\"Who do you think you are? I'm not afraid of you!\" Bobby said arrogantly.\n\"Really? In that case, let's wait and see.\" Victoria sneered, looking at his arrogant demeanor, wanting to slap him.\n\"Try exposing me. Mom won't forgive you.\"\n\"Mom?\" Victoria sneered, \"Since she doesn't treat me as her daughter, why should I consider her my mom?\"\nNo matter what happened, Nora always sided with Bobby, never considering Emily's feelings.\nEspecially after Alvin's incident, Nora treated her as a money-making tool and a pawn to be used, never caring about her.\nShe would rather not have such a mother.\nBobby's expression changed slightly, then returned to normal, \"Victoria, stop trying to scare me. Do you think I'll believe you?\"\n\"Believe it or not.\" Victoria finished speaking and no longer looked at him.\nBobby gritted his teeth, a cold glint in his eyes.\nVictoria didn't want to continue entangling with him. Seeing that there was still half an hour before the award ceremony, she got up and walked to the buffet area.\nBobby watched Victoria's back, his fists clenched, a murderous look in his eyes.\n'Victoria, since you don't know what's good for you, don't blame me for being ruthless!' he thought.\nHe narrowed his eyes, staring darkly in the direction Victoria left.\nVictoria picked some of her favorite fruits, found a quiet corner, and sat down to eat quietly, waiting for the award ceremony to begin.\nWilliam sat in the audience, his deep eyes watching her out of the corner of his eye.\nSeeing her like a little hamster, slowly eating the food on her plate, her cheeks puffed up, he couldn't help but smile.\nVictoria sensed someone watching her, turned her head, and their eyes met. She frowned slightly, then looked away, continuing to eat the delicious food on her plate.\nSeeing this, William frowned, feeling inexplicably irritated.\nAlice followed his gaze and saw Victoria.\nShe sneered, then leaned close to William's ear and said, \"William, the award ceremony is about to start. You're the opening guest, let's take our seats.\"\n\"Okay,\" William responded, getting up and following Alice to his seat.\nThe award ceremony was about to begin. The host took the stage, and the audience applauded warmly.\nVictoria returned to her seat, waiting for the ceremony to start.\nThe host said a few opening remarks and then announced, \"Next, let's welcome Mr. Scott, the renowned CEO of the Scott Group, to deliver a speech for our art association's award ceremony!\"",

He seemed to stride through the light with an air of nobility, each step exuding an unparalleled aura of grace.\nAll eyes were fixed on him, and the audience collectively held their breath.\nOnce William reached the center, he clasped his hands together and nodded slightly. His magnetic voice resonated through the microphone, \"It's an honor to be here at the Art Association's award ceremony.\"\nHe paused, glancing around the room before his gaze settled on Victoria. A slight smile curved his lips as he continued, \"First, I want to congratulate today's award-winning artists. Your works are truly remarkable. I hope you continue to pour your energy into your creations, bringing more excellent works to the world and promoting Crystalia's art globally.\"\nAs William concluded his speech, thunderous applause erupted from the audience. He stepped back behind the curtain, and the host immediately took the stage to introduce this year's award winners.\nBobby won the silver award for Victoria's painting \"The Wounded White Deer.\" Being the youngest among the winners, he received significant praise and attention.\nVictoria watched him bask in the adulation on stage, a mocking smile playing on her lips.\n'How shameless,' she thought. He took her work to win an award and had the audacity to revel in it!\nWith the announcement of the silver award, the ceremony reached its peak.\nThe host, smiling, announced, \"Next, let's congratulate Ms. Carter for winning the gold award. Her piece 'Seeking Warmth' deeply moved every judge.\"\nThe screen lit up with the artwork, depicting a small yet warm corner under towering concrete buildings where an old man and a stray cat shared a moment. The sketch highlighted the city's coldness and the old man's tenderness towards the cat.\n\"Beautiful.\"\n\"No wonder she's Joshua's student; such a clever concept.\"\nThe audience murmured, not just in admiration of the painting but also because of Victoria's identity.\nWilliam, seated below, kept his eyes on the screen displaying the artwork.\nThough he had only glanced at it briefly, he couldn't deny its brilliance.\nAlice noticed his reaction. A hint of sarcasm crept into her smile as she thought, 'Well, Victoria, enjoy your moment while it lasts.'\nShe glanced at Bobby, who gave her a slight nod.\n\"Now, let's welcome Ms. Carter to the stage to receive her award,\" the host announced.\nVictoria, both nervous and excited, stood up and walked lightly to the stage.\nAs she reached the center, the lights brightened, illuminating her and making her shine.\nShe wore a pure white off-shoulder evening gown, the hem reaching her knees, cinched at the waist to accentuate her slender figure. The unique floral design on her chest, adorned with two pieces of sheer fabric, added a touch of mystery. Her long hair cascaded down her back, and her bright, delicate features exuded an ethereal charm.\nThe host, smiling warmly, asked, \"Ms. Carter, do you have anything to say about winning the gold award today?\"\nVictoria smiled and replied, \"Thank you all for this opportunity. I will continue to work hard.\"\nThe audience applauded, cheering for her.\n\"Finally, let's welcome Mr. Scott to present the gold award,\" the host invited with a smile.\nWilliam stood up once more and walked towards the stage.\n\"Congratulations,\" William said, taking the trophy from the usher and handing it to Victoria.\nHis deep eyes, like a bottomless pool, revealed no emotion yet seemed to draw one in.\n\"Thank you,\" Victoria said, momentarily stunned before reaching out to accept the trophy.\nBut in the next second, Bobby suddenly stood up and shouted, \"Wait! I have something to say!\"\nHis words immediately drew everyone's attention.\nVictoria froze, a sense of unease creeping in.\nShe knew Bobby had always harbored resentment towards her, and this was the perfect moment for him to strike.\n\"Victoria, even though you're my sister, I have to say that the painting you won the gold award with isn't yours!\" Bobby's voice was loud and clear. \"That painting is mine. I can't believe you had the audacity to steal it and enter it into the competition!\"\nThe audience erupted in whispers, their eyes darting between the two siblings.\nVictoria's face turned pale. She wanted to defend herself but was rendered speechless by the sudden accusation.\nWilliam's expression darkened, a cold aura emanating from him.\nBobby felt a chill run down his spine as he met William's sharp, menacing gaze, causing him to shrink back slightly.\nBut remembering the hefty reward Alice had promised, he gritted his teeth and continued, \"Anyone can see that the brushstrokes and style of my piece are identical to hers. This proves that Victoria stole my work!\"\nAs Bobby finished speaking, the audience buzzed with discussion.\n\"So Victoria stole her brother's work?\"\n\"This is a disgrace to the art community!\"\n\"I can't believe I thought Victoria's work was good!\"\n\"Is she really Joshua's student? Did she deceive him too?\"\nThe audience's condemnation grew louder, some even questioning Joshua's judgment.\n\"Bobby, stop slandering me!\" Victoria demanded angrily, forcing herself to stay calm. \"This isn't true! You're the one who stole my work, and I didn't expose you. Now you're twisting the facts?\"\n\"Ridiculous! If this piece was stolen from you, then was my first-place piece in the national competition a few months ago also stolen? Anyone can check and see if my style matches these two paintings!\" Bobby retorted confidently, glancing smugly at Victoria.\nThe audience quickly pulled out their phones to verify the information.\nSure enough, Bobby's award-winning piece had the same style as the two paintings in question.\nThe crowd erupted, loudly condemning Victoria and demanding her disqualification.\nVictoria's face turned ashen, her mind buzzing, and she swayed, nearly collapsing.",

Her nose tingled, and she almost started crying.\nShe couldn't understand why this was happening.\nSuddenly, she remembered her Instagram account where she documented her painting process. That could prove that she was the true artist, and Bobby was the thief.\nWith trembling hands, she grabbed the microphone and, holding back her sobs, said, \"Judges, guests, I painted these pieces myself. Bobby is lying. I have proof!\"\nEveryone was stunned and turned to look at Bobby.\nBobby, however, remained unfazed. He smirked and said mockingly, \"Proof? What proof could you possibly have? Victoria, just admit it and apologize. Otherwise, not only will your reputation be ruined, but you'll also drag Mr. Thomas down with you.\"\n\"Enough, shut up!\" Victoria's eyes were bloodshot as she glared at Bobby.\nShe turned her head, scanning the room, and choked out, \"I always document my painting process on Instagram. These records can prove that I painted these.\"\nVictoria finished speaking and took out her phone, ready to log into her Instagram to clear her name.\nHowever, when she tried to log in, the system notified her that her account had been frozen.\nHer eyes widened in disbelief. She logged out and tried again, but it still didn't work.\n\"How could this happen?\" she murmured, \"Why is this happening?\"\nBobby sneered, \"Victoria, stop acting. Just admit your mistake and apologize!\"\nVictoria whipped around, her eyes blazing, \"It was you! You did this!\"\n\"Victoria, what nonsense are you spouting now? How could a poor student like me get your account banned?\" Bobby retorted sarcastically.\nBy now, the audience was tired of Victoria's defense and started shouting for her to apologize and leave.\nSeeing that Victoria had become the target of everyone's anger, William quickly escorted her off the stage.\nAs they reached the bottom of the stage, Alice suddenly appeared, blocking their way.\nAlice looked at Victoria with disdain and sneered, \"I didn't expect you to be so shameless! How could you steal your own brother's work and enter it into the competition?\"\n\"I didn't!\" Victoria clenched her fists, struggling to control her emotions.\nAlice curled her lip in contempt, \"It's bad enough that you're embarrassing yourself, but do you have to drag William down with you?\"\nWilliam wanted to say something, but Alice cut him off, \"William, don't forget, I'm your girlfriend. If you take Victoria away in front of everyone, do you want her to be humiliated even more?\"\nWilliam frowned at her words.\nHe looked around at the crowd, who were filled with disgust for Victoria, and at the media, who were constantly filming. After a moment of hesitation, he let go of Victoria's arm and stepped aside.\nVictoria stared at him in shock, her eyes red, tears glistening on her lashes, ready to fall at any moment.\n\"Aren't you going to leave?\" Alice snorted.\nVictoria clutched her dress tightly, suppressing her overwhelming sense of injustice, and ran out of the venue.\nWatching Victoria's panicked retreat, Alice twisted her face into a sinister smile.\nWilliam watched her leave, a complex emotion flickering in his eyes.\nHis gaze swept over Alice, who was gloating, and a trace of annoyance crossed his brow. He turned indifferently and walked out of the venue.\nVictoria had just run out of the venue when she was surrounded by reporters.\n\"Ms. Carter, did you really steal Bobby's work?\"\n\"Did you win the gold medal by cheating?\"\n\"Don't you think you're tarnishing your teacher's reputation by doing this?\"\nThe reporters' aggressive questions bombarded Victoria's ears. She covered her ears and ran desperately.\nThe reporters chased her relentlessly, following her to the elevator.\n\"Ms. Carter, please answer our questions!\"\nThe reporters were persistent, continuously asking questions.\nVictoria, with red-rimmed eyes, tried to avoid their cameras, but the more she dodged, the sharper their questions became.\nShe finally broke free and ran to the roadside, hoping to catch a cab.\nA van suddenly swerved in front of her.\nThe door opened, and seven or eight people, including an elderly man and a few teenagers, got out.\nSeeing Victoria, they rushed over and started attacking her.\n\"That damn Alvin! This is his daughter!\"\n\"Is your father even human? His bridge design collapsed, killing so many people! Those workers' and managers' families are ruined!\"\n\"Everyone, look! This is Alvin's daughter!\"\nVictoria's hair was disheveled, her clothes being pulled by several hands. She bit her lip, protecting herself as best as she could.\n\"Hit her! Hit her!\"\n\"Alvin's daughter must be just as bad! She must be involved in those shady dealings!\"\n\"Look at her! She must be a loose woman! Her father is a murderer, and she's a disgrace!\"\nMore and more people gathered, whispering.\nThe media, who had been chasing Victoria, swarmed over like flies to a carcass, their cameras flashing incessantly.\nThe name \"Alvin\" reminded many of the catastrophic bridge collapse.\nDue to a design flaw, the bridge had collapsed during construction, burying many workers and managers, ending their lives in an instant.\nSome onlookers, unable to bear seeing a young woman being bullied, wanted to help but were stopped by their companions.\nThis was something they couldn't get involved in.\nIf they intervened, they would become targets themselves.\nAfter all, the disaster Alvin caused was too severe, and these families needed an outlet for their anger.\nBeing Alvin's daughter seemed like an inescapable sin.\nVictoria's face was bruised and swollen, her lips bleeding, tears streaming down her face.\nShe didn't fight back, curling up and silently enduring the pain.\nSuddenly, a coat was thrown over her head, and she was pulled into a warm embrace.",

An aura of terrifying anger radiated from him.\nThe onlookers, feeling the chill emanating from William, took a few steps back in fear.\n\"Listen up,\" William growled, his voice low and menacing, \"if anyone lays a finger on her again, I'll make sure they regret it.\"\nThe attackers swallowed nervously. They didn't know who William was, but his presence alone was enough to make them tremble.\nAlice had come out to watch the spectacle, never expecting William to rush in and defend Victoria like this. After all, Alvin, the man responsible for his parents' deaths, was someone William had always hated the most. How could he be so protective of that woman?\nAlice's chest ached with anger. She suppressed her fury and feigned concern, saying, \"William, be careful not to get hurt yourself. Come back here.\"\nWilliam hadn't been this angry in years. This time, he was truly furious. He had just left the conference hall when he saw a large group of people surrounding and beating Victoria. Her frail body couldn't possibly withstand such an assault. And some despicable men were even taking the opportunity to sexually harass her!\nWilliam's eyes narrowed with a vicious glint, and a cold, murderous aura surrounded him. He reached out with his long, elegant fingers, grabbed a lecherous middle-aged man, and threw him to the ground with force.\nThe man screamed in pain.\nWilliam's icy gaze then fell on two other lecherous men. He kicked them both in the ribs, causing them to collapse to the ground, writhing in agony.\nSuppressing his violent emotions, William bent down and lifted Victoria into his arms, striding towards the car without looking back.\nVictoria buried her face in his broad chest, her tears soaking his expensive cashmere sweater. William felt a sharp pain in his heart, a dull ache spreading through his body, making it hard to breathe. He thought of how she had been bullied. If he hadn't been there, the consequences would have been unbearable.\nSince Alvin's arrest, Victoria had dropped out of college and, for Nora's sake, had become his sugar baby. She had been bullied by Ella and Alice, cyberbullied, humiliated, and even he had been one of her tormentors.\nWilliam closed his eyes, trying to convince himself that she deserved all this because she was Alvin's daughter, the man who had caused his parents' deaths. But seeing others hurt Victoria made him feel a pang of guilt and heartache.\nHe lowered his gaze, his deep eyes flickering with a dark light, and his thin lips pressed together. He held her soft, fragrant body tightly.\n\"Don't cry,\" William sighed softly. \"I'll take you to the hospital.\"\nVictoria nodded, feeling a sense of calm wash over her in William's strong embrace. She knew that as long as she was with him, she would be safe.\nBobby, lurking in the shadows, waited for the crowd to thin out before approaching Alice.\n\"Ms. Garcia, I took a big risk with this,\" he said, his voice low.\nAlice gave him a sly smile. \"You did well. The money's already in your account.\"\nBobby's face lit up with a sycophantic grin. \"Thank you, Ms. Garcia.\"\n\"I'll arrange for the media to interview you later. Make sure to destroy Victoria's reputation so she can't bounce back,\" Alice said, her tone dripping with malice, making Bobby shiver.\nHe felt a twinge of guilt but quickly brushed it aside, thinking of the wealthy classmates who flaunted their riches. If Alvin hadn't failed, he wouldn't have to take such risks himself.\n\"Don't worry, Ms. Garcia. I'll make sure Victoria is disgraced and ruined.\"\nAt the hospital, William stayed with Victoria through her examination.\n\"Nothing serious, just some superficial injuries. She just needs to rest for a few days,\" the doctor advised before leaving.\nWilliam nodded, watching the sleeping Victoria. Her delicate body was covered in bruises, and the red handprints on her cheeks were particularly shocking. He picked up a cotton swab, dipped it in iodine, and began to disinfect her wounds.\n\"Please, it hurts. Stop hitting me,\" Victoria whimpered in her sleep, her brow furrowed as if trapped in a nightmare.\nWilliam's heart ached with pity. It reminded him of his own helplessness when he was bullied after his parents' death. He applied the ointment gently, massaging her swollen areas to ease the pain.\nVictoria sighed softly, her brow relaxing as she continued to sleep. He tenderly stroked her swollen cheek and whispered, \"It's okay now.\"\nHe looked out at the dark sky, his eyes filled with complex emotions. \"I won't let them hurt you again, including myself.\"\nHis voice was hoarse, filled with exhaustion and helplessness. William took out his phone and texted Harry: [Suppress tonight's incident. No reports.]\nHarry hesitated before sending: [Mr. Scott, tonight's incident was quite public, and it involves the art association's competition.We need to clear Ms. Carter's name first.]\nWilliam replied: [I trust you'll find a way.]\nHarry stared at the dark screen, muttering to himself, 'Mr. Scott was pushing me to take extreme measures. But what choice did I have? He's the boss.'\nWilliam rubbed his temples and stood up. Just as he was about to step out for a smoke, he saw Alice standing outside the room, arms crossed, glaring at him.\nHe frowned but ignored her.\nAlice said coldly, \"You took her away in front of everyone. Have you thought about how people will mock me?\"\nWilliam lit a cigarette, exhaling a smoke ring, and asked nonchalantly, \"Did you do this?\"",

I was the one hanging around her.\"\nAlice was stunned for a moment, then burst into a sharp laugh. \"William, are you serious? Do you like her? What about me? Didn't you promise to marry me?\"\nShe looked at him with hopeful eyes, her tears threatening to fall.\nSeeing her like this, William's heart softened, and his tone became gentler. \"Alice, I will keep my promise to you, but please, stop causing trouble for Victoria.\"\n\"You're actually pleading for her?\" Alice shouted, her eyes misting over.\nShe shook her head in disbelief. \"Are you crazy? Her father killed your parents, and you still defend her?\"\nHer voice grew more agitated, and she pointed a trembling finger at him, screaming hysterically, \"I'll leave her alone if you cut ties with her completely!\"\nWilliam narrowed his eyes, staring at her menacingly.\n\"Alice, I'm warning you. Do not harm her. Or else, don't blame me for what happens next.\"\nHis sudden anger startled Alice. She looked at him in disbelief. \"You're threatening me for that bitch?

Sure! Just kill me! Kill me, and everything will be solved!\"\nWilliam's eyes darkened, and a terrifying aura emanated from him.\nAlice met his gaze fearlessly, the tension between them palpable.\nAfter a long silence, William finally reined in his anger, his voice calm but seething with fury. \"Alice, stop this nonsense!\"\nAlice sneered. \"William, you know me. Since I was a child, I never let anyone take what's mine without a fight!\"\nWith that, she pushed past William and walked away, her back resolute.\nWilliam stood there for a long time, his deep eyes lowered, making it impossible to guess what he was thinking.\nAfter a while, he took out his phone. \"Dr. Simmons, about Alice's condition...\" \nWhen Victoria woke up, it was already early morning. The room was silent.\nHer whole body ached, and she barely had the strength to sit up.\nShe opened her bleary eyes, seeing the white sheets and smelling the strong scent of disinfectant.\nA needle was inserted into the back of her hand, with fluid slowly dripping into her veins.\nWhere was she?\nShe blinked hard, her mind gradually clearing as she remembered everything that had happened that night.\nStruggling to sit up, she saw William asleep on the small sofa in the hospital room, his tall frame looking cramped.\nVictoria's heart softened.\nShe hadn't expected William to leave Alice to save her in such a situation.\nAfter being betrayed by those closest to her and humiliated by everyone, only William had stood up to protect her.\nTears welled up in Victoria's eyes. She sniffled, carefully walking over to him and lying down beside him, nestling against his broad chest.\nThis was her only safe haven, the only place she could escape the storm.\nEven though she knew he would never be hers.\nBut just for today, she allowed herself to be greedy, just this once.\nVictoria hugged William's lean waist tightly, feeling a sense of security she had never known.\nWilliam seemed to sense something, opening his eyes and looking down at her. \"You're awake.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Victoria replied, gazing up at his chiseled features, her heart warming. \"Thanks for saving me.\"\nWilliam held her tighter, unable to resist planting a light kiss on her lips. \"How are you feeling now?\"\n\"I'm okay,\" she said lightly, her gaze drifting.\nWilliam rubbed her head gently, murmuring, \"Silly girl, you're so hurt, yet you still pretend to be strong.\"\n\"I'm fine,\" Victoria forced a smile. \"It's just some minor injuries.\"\nWilliam looked at her for a few seconds, his lips pressed into a thin line.\nAfter a while, he spoke in a low voice, \"Are you hungry? I had some soup prepared. Get up and have some.\"\nVictoria nodded. \"Okay.\"\nWilliam helped her sit up, placing a pillow behind her.\nVictoria drank the soup, feeling a bit more comfortable.\nWilliam looked at her bruised face and took out some ointment to apply.\nVictoria sat quietly, letting him carefully apply the ointment, her voice hoarse. \"I must look awful now, right?\"\nWilliam glanced at her and smirked. \"Not too bad.\"\nThough she looked battered, there was a certain beauty in her vulnerability that was oddly captivating.\nHe continued to apply the ointment, and Victoria pouted, mumbling, \"You're just humoring me. You're not honest at all.\"\n\"You don't believe me?\" William asked, his eyes deep.\nVictoria shook her head.\n\"Then feel this,\" he said with a mischievous smile, grabbing her hand and placing it on his lower abdomen. \"See if it's honest.\"\nVictoria gasped, pulling her hand back in a panic, her face flushing. \"William, you're such a rogue! You can get aroused anytime, anywhere!\"\nHe chuckled, raising an eyebrow with a hint of roguishness. \"Not always.\"\nVictoria was speechless, shocked by his shamelessness.\nWilliam was too much for her to handle.\nWilliam's eyes darkened with desire as he saw her blushing face. He spoke hoarsely, \"Victoria.\"\nHearing him call her name, Victoria shivered, instinctively trying to put some distance between them.\nWilliam held her in place, his thumb caressing her skin, leaning down to gently lick her.\nThe tingling sensation made her body tense up, and Victoria stared at him in a panic. \"Stop it!\"",

Instead, he silenced her with a kiss.\nVictoria tried to resist, wanting to break free from his embrace, but her body was too weak to muster any strength.\n\"Come on, open your mouth,\" William coaxed gently, guiding her to swallow as he kissed her, his nimble tongue prying her teeth apart and exploring her sweetness.\nHis large hand moved to the back of her neck, slowly inching forward, causing her to shiver.\n\"William, stop...\" Victoria tried to push his shoulder away, but he held her tightly.\nWilliam released her lips and whispered softly in her ear, \"Baby, do you know that every time you call my name, it drives me wild with excitement?\"\n\"You jerk! I'm still in pain!\" Victoria's face flushed red as she pounded his firm chest with her fists.\nWilliam suppressed his heavy breathing, sweat beading on his forehead, his voice hoarse, \"Don't make a fuss, be quiet, let me take care of you.\"\n\"William!\" Victoria gritted her teeth and called out his name.\n\"I love it when you call me that,\" he murmured, nibbling on her delicate earlobe.\nVictoria felt a jolt of pleasure course through her body at his touch, making her tremble.\n\"William, let me go,\" Victoria pushed against his chest, \"I'm so tired, I need to rest.\"\n\"I'll be quick!\" William's voice was a strained growl.\nVictoria closed her eyes, trying to control her impulses and heat, desperately telling herself not to indulge him any further.\nHer silence only fueled his desire. His hand slipped under her dress, gently massaging her through her underwear.\nVictoria let out a muffled groan, her body stiffening.\nWilliam was pleased. He bit her rounded earlobe, his tone seductive, \"Be good, I'll be gentle. Just cooperate.\"\nVictoria trembled all over, clutching his shirt tightly, \"You need to stop.\"\nShe couldn't take it anymore.\nIgnoring her plea, he buried his face in her ample bosom, acting wantonly.\nVictoria writhed in discomfort, her slender waist twisting.\nShe was already drenched between her legs, soaking through.\nWilliam's eyes burned with desire. He cupped her buttocks with one hand and her breast with the other, gently kneading, \"Do you want it?\"\nVictoria shook her head, \"No!\"\n\"No what?\" His eyes gleamed menacingly.\nVictoria didn't know how to explain, so she bit her lower lip.\n\"Relax,\" he whispered seductively in her ear.\nHis words worked. Gradually, Victoria adapted to his presence, her body becoming more pliant.\nEntwined together, the room filled with a sultry, erotic atmosphere.\nVictoria lay on the bed, William on top of her, his heavy breaths falling on her collarbone, making her moan softly.\n\"William,\" Victoria called out sweetly, \"Be gentle!\"\nWilliam gave a wicked smile and thrust into her body.\nVictoria winced in pain, tears welling up in her eyes.\nHis movements grew more aggressive, and Victoria couldn't help but cry out.\n\"William, you're hurting me,\" she whimpered, her voice filled with grievance.\nWilliam paused, quickly wiping away her tears with concern.\nVictoria bit her lip hard, wrapping her arms around his neck, burying her face in his chest.\nHe kissed her tenderly, moving slowly.\nVictoria moaned softly, \"William!\"\nHer voice was soft and alluring, like an aphrodisiac, stirring him up.\nThey remained entwined for a long time before finally coming to a stop.\nVictoria lay motionless on the bed, unwilling to move. William brought a basin of hot water, wrung out a towel, and began to clean her body.\nVictoria lay back, letting him take care of her, her gaze falling on his handsome, chiseled profile. She sighed softly, a strange bitterness welling up inside her.\nTonight, he had been so gentle and attentive, and it felt like a dream.\nAfter cleaning her up, William held her in his arms, kissing her forehead, \"What's wrong? Why the sudden sadness?\"\nShe pressed her lips together, hesitated for a few seconds, then asked, \"Was today's incident caused by Alice?\"\nWilliam froze, not answering.\nShe gave a bitter smile, \"I knew it.\"\n\"Don't worry,\" William kissed her forehead, \"I won't let her hurt you again.\"\n\"You can't do that,\" Victoria smiled sadly, \"She's your precious darling. How could you bear to trouble her?\"\nWilliam fell silent, his arms tightening around her.\nVictoria sighed, \"What am I to you? According to Alice, I'm just a tool you bought to satisfy your lust.\"\n\"Don't overthink it!\" William warned in a low voice.\n\"I'm not overthinking,\" Victoria looked at him seriously, \"William, tell me honestly, what am I to you? A mistress? A sex buddy? Or a prostitute?\"\nHer expression was calm, as if stating a fact.\nWilliam's face darkened. He stared at her deeply, his lips pressed into a tight line, seemingly contemplating how to respond.\nVictoria met his deep gaze, \"William, you're my first and only man. Every time I'm in a desperate situation, you're the one who helps me. Although I never wanted to admit it, I do have feelings for you.\"\nShe calmly revealed her deepest emotions.\nWilliam's heart tightened, as if stung by a bee, a strange feeling spreading through his body. He held her tighter, \"You really...\"\n\"Yes,\" Victoria answered, both ashamed and honest, \"If I truly didn't want to sleep with you, could you really force me? I have nothing to lose, I could just end it all.\"\nHis body grew even more rigid, his throat constricted, unable to find words to refute her.\n\"Even though you always threaten me, allowing Ella and Alice to bully me, I still have some hope for you,\" Victoria smiled self-deprecatingly, \"Like just now, you protected me and took care of me so gently. Can I believe that you have feelings for me too?\"\nHer words pierced through his tough exterior, leaving him bleeding inside.\nHow could he like her?\nShe was Alvin's daughter! How could he forgive her? There was no future for them!",

        "content": "He forced down the storm of emotions in his heart, suddenly sat up, and said coldly, \"No, you're overthinking it. To me, you're just a toy.\"\nWhen Victoria heard this, it felt like a boulder had struck her heart, causing a dull pain. She blinked her wet eyelashes and forced a smile. \"Yeah, I'm just a toy you bought. But I have feelings. If you don't care about me and can't give me a proper place in your life, then don't come looking for me anymore. I don't want to get hurt by your girlfriend because of you. I wish you both happiness in advance.\"\nHearing this, William's face turned frighteningly dark. He narrowed his long, deep eyes, staring at Victoria with a cold, piercing gaze, as if he wanted to devour her alive.\nVictoria met his gaze fearlessly, not blinking.\nA surge of anger rose in William's heart. He stood up, looking down at her from above, his eyes shooting out a chilling light. \"Fine. Very well!\"\nWith that, he slammed the door and left.\nVictoria pulled the blanket over her head, curling up, a tear slipping from the corner of her eye.\nShe craved the warmth he gave her so much, and she didn't want to say anything to ruin the moment.\nBut she couldn't let herself get lost in an illusion of happiness; she had to stay clear-headed.\nNone of this belonged to her in the first place!\nFor a man like William, the more indifferent you acted towards him, the more he wanted to conquer you.\nOn the contrary, if you showedaffection first, he would only grow tired and annoyed with you.\nThinking of William's disgusted look just now, she felt her nose tingle, and tears streamed down her cheeks.\nHe didn't love her, never had.\nVictoria closed her eyes, her heart wrenching painfully as if being torn apart.\nWilliam slammed the car door shut, stepped on the gas, and sped away.\nAll the way, he floored the gas pedal.\nHe didn't understand why, when he heard Victoria's words, a feeling akin to panic surged in his heart.\nHe hated this uncontrollable feeling.\nOf course, he knew why Victoria said she liked him. It was just to use reverse psychology to push him away.\nYet, he had fallen for it and said so many hurtful things to her.\nHer bruised body and pained eyes haunted him, as if ants were gnawing at his heart, making it hard to endure. \nA sudden screech of brakes echoed through the city. William's knuckles turned white as he gripped the steering wheel.\n'Victoria, what am I supposed to do with you?' he wondered.\nVictoria barely slept all night and was woken by her phone ringing.\nShe opened her tired eyes, groggily reaching for her phone, not even looking at the screen before putting it to her ear.\nSamuel's anxious voice came through the line, \"Victoria, are you okay?\"\nVictoria's sleepiness vanished instantly. She sat up quickly, despite the soreness all over her body. \"I'm fine.\"\n\"I heard your brother accused you of stealing his work, and then you were bullied by a group of people,\" Samuel's voice was heavy with worry.\nVictoria sniffed, trying to steady her emotions. \"Don't worry, I'm fine now.\"\nHearing her choked-up voice, Samuel's heart ached even more. \"Victoria, don't be afraid. My studio has surveillance. Those two paintings were completed in my studio. I can testify for you. I won't let anyone falsely accuse you!\"\nWarmth surged in Victoria's heart. Besides Alvin, Samuel was the one who cared about her the most in this world.\nBut she kept letting him down.\n\"Samuel, thank you...\" She bit her lip. \"I'm sorry for always dragging you into my mess.\"\nSamuel sighed. She still didn't understand that what he wanted to hear was never her thanks.\n\"Victoria, if you really want to thank me, promise me that when you run into trouble, you'll call me first. I'll do everything I can to protect you!\"\nVictoria was stunned for a moment, her eyes suddenly turning red. She choked up, \"Okay, I promise you!\"\nAfter hanging up, Victoria hugged her knees, leaning against the wall, slowly squatting down, burying her head in her arms.\nShe knew Samuel was sincere.\nAnd she did have feelings for Samuel. He was like a ray of sunshine shining into her dark heart.\nShe couldn't bear to reject him, but she didn't dare to get close, afraid of tainting this pure beauty.\nMaybe one day, when she completely cut ties with William and freed herself from this mess, she wouldn't avoid him anymore.\nVictoria was lost in thought for a long time until a nurse came to change her bandages, bringing her back to reality.\nAfter the nurse finished, she nervously opened the trending topics online.\nAfter the last online attack, she was terrified of being dragged into the spotlight again.\nShe was just an ordinary girl, not strong enough to face endless insults and abuse.\nThose clueless netizens were like poisonous wasps, stinging anyone they could.\nSuch public opinion would drown her, plunging her life back into darkness, never to see the light of day.\nBut this time, she didn't fall into the abyss as expected.\nDespite the huge commotion last night, there wasn't a single stir online today.\nVictoria guessed it was William's doing.\nBut what she didn't know was that to quell the situation, Harry had personally visited each person on the list from last night, deleting all recordings and videos.\nHe also threatened all media outlets-anyone who dared to report anything negative about Victoria would be seen as against William.\nThis move silenced all reporters and paparazzi teams, who chose to keep quiet.\nEven posts from ordinary netizens disappeared instantly.\nVictoria breathed a sigh of relief, no longer worried about her job being affected.\nBut with her face bruised and swollen, she wasn't fit to go out for work. She applied for two days of remote work with Diana.\nThough her pay was significantly lower and her body was in pain, she couldn't keep taking leave.\nDiana readily agreed.\nIn the CEO's office at the Scott Group\nHarry knocked and entered, respectfully reporting to William, who was reviewing documents. \"Mr. Scott, I've taken care of everything you arranged. All news media have retracted and blocked the stories.\"\nWilliam didn't look up, continuing to review the documents.\nHe asked coldly, \"What about the art association?\"\nHarry paused for a moment before cautiously speaking, \"Mr. Scott, the art association initially refused to suppress the matter, given it involved their gold and silver award winners. But they just called to say Ms. Carter's innocence has been proven, and her awards will be reinstated.\"\n\"Proven?\" William sneered, his eyes darkening.",

They wouldn't cave so easily. Someone must've done something to make them change their tune so fast.\"\nHarry suddenly got it. \"Could it be Samuel?\"\nWilliam's brow furrowed slightly. \"Probably. Go find out what he did.\"\nHarry hesitated for a moment and then suggested, \"Mr. Scott, why not just ask Ms. Carter directly?\"\nWilliam shot Harry a sidelong glance. \"Why all the chatter?\"\nHarry was at a loss for words, gave an awkward smile, and quickly left.\nAfter Harry left, William rubbed his temples, Victoria's bruised face flashing in his mind.\nHe wondered if she was feeling any better.\nWilliam lit a cigarette, the smoke curling around his handsome features.\nDaisy had just returned from visiting Victoria at the hospital and was immediately angered by William's brooding demeanor.\n\"You're here leisurely smoking after you and Alice have caused so much harm to Victoria!\" Daisy glared at him.\nWilliam flicked the ash off his cigarette, speaking nonchalantly. \"Aunt Daisy, are you my ant or hers? Why do you always side with her?\"\nDaisy was momentarily stunned but quickly retorted, \"You brat, I'm being fair. That Alice uses her illness as an excuse to torment Victoria repeatedly, and you do nothing? You even enable her. You...\"\nWilliam lazily stood up and walked to the window.\nHe looked down at the bustling streets below, his voice indifferent. \"You know I owe her.\"\nDaisy stomped her foot in frustration. \"That's your debt, not Victoria's! You can't keep letting her hurt Victoria!\"\nWilliam turned around, his gaze deep and silent for a moment before he spoke. \"I know what to do. Don't worry about it.\"\nDaisy sat down angrily. \"I hope you mean what you say. If Alice targets Victoria again, I'll take Victoria to Harborview City and find her a good man! Anything is better than being your hidden mistress.\"\n\"Aunt Daisy!\" William's brow furrowed, his tone growing heavier.\nDaisy pouted, muttering, \"Fine, fine, I give up. I won't interfere. Poor Victoria.\"\nWilliam's eyes flickered, but he said nothing.\nDaisy sighed and continued, \"I didn't just come here for Victoria. I also wanted to tell you that the Wayne family has moved back to Harborview City. You should know why.\"\nWilliam raised an eyebrow but said nothing.\nDaisy added, \"Your grandfather's health hasn't been good lately. When I visited him at the nursing home, he mentioned you and said he wanted you to visit him.\"\nWilliam pondered for a moment and then nodded. \"Alright, I'll make time to visit soon.\"\nDaisy smiled with relief, patting his shoulder. \"William, you're not getting any younger. Think carefully about who you like and settle down soon. Don't wait until it's too late.\"\nWilliam lowered his eyes, hiding the unusual look in them. \"Okay.\"\nNot long after Daisy left, the phone on William's desk rang.\nWilliam pressed the answer button, and Harry's voice came through immediately. \"Mr. Scott, I found out from the art association. That Samuel is actually Joshua. He sent a video of Ms. Carter painting in his studio to the judges.\"\nWilliam's lips tightened, his eyes darkening, his voice icy. \"What about Bobby?\"\nHarry replied, \"His awards have been revoked, and he's banned from participating in any future art association competitions.\"\nWilliam let out a cold laugh, his tone mocking. \"That's not enough. Since Victoria's name has been cleared, have the media spread the news. Inform his school too. Victoria doesn't need a backstabbing brother like him!\"\nHis voice carried a chilling, murderous intent that sent shivers down one's spine.\nHarry quickly responded, \"Yes, I'll take care of it right away.\"\nAfter hanging up, Harry immediately called various media outlets.\nWithin half an hour, headlines like \"He Steals Sister's Work and Played the Accuser,\" \"She Drops Out to Support Family, Only to Be Betrayed by Her Brother,\" and \"The Truth Behind Sibling Fallout\" dominated the trending lists, drawing countless onlookers and going viral overnight.\nBobby walked through the school like a rat in a maze, pointed at and whispered about wherever he went.\nIt was a stark contrast to the glory he had basked in the day before when he returned to school with the art association's grand prize.\nFurious, Bobby gritted his teeth. \"That Victoria! Bitch!\"\nIf it weren't for her, he would be the rightful rising star in the art world. How could he have fallen to this point?\nHe clenched his fists, cursing viciously. \"You wretched woman! How dare you ruin my future! I won't let you get away with this.\"\nHe put on a hat and sunglasses, covering most of his face, and hurriedly left the school, calling Alice repeatedly, but no one answered.\nIn a fit of rage, he smashed his phone, cursing, \"Damn woman!\"\nIt seemed she had abandoned him!\nHe stormed into Nora's hospital room, smashing everything in sight.\nNora was terrified, clutching her chest and trembling. \"Bobby, why are you so angry?\"\nBobby's eyes were bloodshot as he glared at her. \"Mom, I'm done for. It's all over!\"\nNora was horrified. \"What happened?\"\nBobby exaggerated the story, ending with a look of despair. \"Mom, the school is going to expel me, and the training team has kicked me out. What am I going to do?\"\nHe collapsed to the floor, crying his heart out. \"Mom, you have to save me!\"\nNora's face turned pale as she tried to calm him. \"It'll be okay. Don't worry. We'll figure something out.\"\nBobby grabbed her leg, looking up with tearful eyes, pleading. \"Mom, we have to find Victoria. If she admits to stealing the painting, I might still have a chance!\"\nNora hesitated, then her eyes lit up with a plan. \"Alright, let's go find her.\"",

Get lost and don't ever bother me again.\"\nBobby, tears streaming down his face, wailed, \"Victoria, I know I was wrong. I was out of my mind, I was stupid. Please, give me another chance.\"\nVictoria felt a wave of nausea at his pitiful act.\nShe sneered, \"Do you think I would believe you again? Do you take me for a fool?\"\nBobby, face contorted with grief, cried even harder, \"Victoria, please, just one more chance. I really know I was wrong!\"\nNora joined in, crying, \"Victoria, I know you think I favor Bobby, but your dad is in prison, and you've dropped out of school. Do you really want to ruin Bobby's future too?\"\nVictoria gave them both a cold look, her tone light and dismissive, \"So, you want to force me to sacrifice myself for him again?\"\nNora was at a loss for words.\nBobby quickly chimed in, \"Victoria, you don't have much of a future anyway, but I do. I have a college interview coming up. Can you really bear to ruin my future now?\"\nHe looked so desperate and pleading that anyone would feel a pang of sympathy.\nVictoria smiled, seemingly in reflection, \"You're right, I don't have much of a future. However, I'm definitely not going to take the blame for someone who framed me. Sorry, I'm not that noble. I can't be a hero who sacrifices herself to save others.\"\nWith that, she walked away without a second glance.\nNora suddenly lunged at her, grabbing her arm and screaming hysterically, \"Victoria, if Bobby's ruined, I won't live either!\"\nVictoria frowned, pried her hand off forcefully, and said impatiently, \"Let go of me!\"\nNora refused to let go, continuing her tantrum, \"You have to help Bobby! I know you hate us, but we're still your family. Are you really that heartless to let us die?\"\n\"Family?\" Victoria laughed as if she had heard a joke, \"Bobby spread rumors online that I sold my body for job opportunities, stole my work to enter a competition, and then accused me of stealing his painting. It wasn't just for Alice's money, right?\"\nVictoria turned to Bobby with a mocking look, \"Do you think that by destroying me, I'll be your puppet, painting for you?\"\nBobby's face changed colors, and he stammered, \"I didn't, Victoria, you misunderstood.\"\nVictoria gave Bobby a cold look, turned, and walked quickly away. She had just taken two steps when Nora suddenly ran to the window, turning to shout at Victoria, \"Victoria, if you dare to leave, I'll jump!\"\nVictoria froze, standing still, unable to move. She slowly turned her head, looking at Nora with a complex expression.\nVictoria was stunned for a moment, then rushed over to pull her down, \"Are you crazy?\"\nNora took the opportunity to slap Victoria across the face, \"Crazy? Bobby is my life. If you harm him, you harm me! I'm telling you, if you don't help Bobby through this crisis today, I'll jump right now!\"\nBlood instantly seeped from the corner of Victoria's mouth. She touched her mouth and laughed mockingly.\nShe had long been accustomed to Nora's unfair treatment and had long been completely disheartened, but she hadn't expected that besides kneeling to her, Nora would also threaten her life for Bobby.\nBobby, trembling in a corner, saw that Victoria wasn't moving and mustered the courage to shout at her, \"Victoria, did you hear that? If you don't help me, you'll be the one who killed your own mother!\"\nVictoria sneered, looking at Bobby with disdain.\nBobby, feeling a chill under her gaze, continued to threaten her, \"Are you going to help or not?\"\nVictoria looked at Nora and Bobby and suddenly laughed.\nShaking her head, she murmured, \"I've never expected you to care about me or love me. I thought you at least had some conscience. But I overestimated you.\"\nNora and Bobby exchanged a silent glance.\nVictoria continued, \"For money and your own interests, you've repeatedly harmed and threatened me. I've forgiven you time and again for the sake of family, even willing to give unconditionally. I always thought you felt some guilt, even just a little. But now, you're even using your life to threaten me.\"\nHer eyes lowered, and her eyes slightly reddened, \"You really disappoint me. I wonder if I'm really your family. In that case, I'll go all out. Let's die together!\"\nWith that, Victoria suddenly raised her eyes, revealing a look of determination. She took a deep breath and stepped onto the windowsill.\nNora's eyes turned red, and she screamed, \"Victoria, do you have to be so heartless? I gave birth to you and raised you. Don't you have any mother-daughter feelings?\"\n\"Yeah, Victoria, how can you be so cold-hearted?\" Bobby echoed.\nVictoria gritted her teeth, \"Mother-daughter feelings? Do you remember we're mother and daughter? In your eyes, there's only money! I've had enough! I said last time, I won't be threatened by you anymore!\"\nVictoria cried out with all her might, as if releasing all the grievances she had endured over the years. She didn't want to compromise anymore. She wasn't a puppet; she was a person!\nAs she shouted in fury, she almost lost her balance and nearly fell, but she grabbed the railing just in time to steady herself.\nWilliam had just entered the hospital when he saw this scene: Victoria standing on the windowsill, seemingly about to fall at any moment.\nHis pupils contracted, and his heart tightened. He finally understood what it felt like to be in utter chaos.\nA great panic seized his breath. William could barely control his steps as he sprinted up the stairs, rushing to the fifth floor and reaching the windowsill.\nAt this moment, Victoria's legs were dangling, trembling violently.\nSeeing this, William's chest filled with rage, but he didn't dare to shout, fearing he would scare her.\nHe could only suppress his anger with all his might, speaking softly to comfort her, \"Victoria, listen to me. Whatever it is, come down first.\"\nSeeing him suddenly appear, Victoria began to cry.",

If you dare leave, I'll jump from the upstairs window!\"\nVictoria's relaxed body tensed up again.

If you hurt him, I'll fight you to the death!\"\nWilliam ignored her, tightening his grip on Bobby's neck, his face menacing.\nBobby's face turned red as he struggled to breathe, managing to choke out, \"You... you...\"\nHis legs kicked frantically, trying to break free from William's iron grip.\nBut William's hold was unyielding, and Bobby's efforts were in vain.\nNora, terrified, no longer dared to threaten Victoria. She crawled over to save Bobby, crying and begging, \"William, please let Bobby go!\"\nWilliam's face remained cold as he refused, \"You shouldn't be begging me!\"\nNora trembled all over, turning to Victoria and pleading, \"Victoria, I'm begging you, please make him let Bobby go. I'll do anything you want!\"\nSeeing Nora's pitiful state, Victoria's heart softened a bit.\nShe took a deep breath, slowly releasing her grip on the railing and stepping back into the room. William quickly reached out to support her and simultaneously let go of Bobby.\nHe looked at Victoria's pale face with concern, his eyes full of pity.\nBobby lay on the ground, coughing violently and drenched in sweat.\nNora held him, slumped on the floor.\nBobby glared at William with hatred, wishing he could tear him apart.\nVictoria wiped away her tears and walked over to Bobby, looking down at him with a calm gaze. \"Bobby, this is the path you chose. Now, face the consequences.\"\n\"Mom, you have to help me!\" Bobby pleaded with Nora, hoping she could persuade Victoria to change her mind.\nVictoria shook her head and laughed, \"If you can't stay here, you can go abroad! You got so much money from Ella and Alice, it's enough for you to live and study abroad!\"\nBobby stared at her in disbelief, \"You're kicking me out!\"\nHis voice rose, filled with resentment and bitterness.\nVictoria sneered, \"What else? Let you stay here and leech off me? Bobby, I've told you before, there's nothing between us anymore!\"\nBobby trembled with anger, but he knew that if Victoria didn't relent, going abroad was his best option.\nBut he couldn't let Victoria off so easily. He gritted his teeth and said, \"Fine, I'll go abroad, but since it's expensive, you have to give me more money!\"\nVictoria's head buzzed with anger at his audacity.\nNora immediately chimed in, \"Yes, Victoria, give Bobby more money so he can study abroad!\"\nVictoria snorted, \"Are you crazy? I paid for your medical bills and his tuition. Do you think I'm a bank?\"\n\"Of course you have money! Aren't you Mr. Scott's mistress? How could you not have money?\" Nora retorted, ignoring William's presence.\nWilliam's face darkened, and he sternly rebuked, \"Nora, don't push it!\"\nNora shrank back, muttering, \"I'm just telling the truth! Bobby needs a lot of money. Victoria, I promise, if you give Bobby more money, I'll never bother you again!\"\nVictoria found Nora's shamelessness laughable.\nHow could such a greedy, shameless woman be her mother?\nVictoria laughed until her eyes turned red. She looked up at the ceiling, holding back her tears.\nWilliam saw her forced smile and felt a sharp pain in his heart.\nHe gently touched her cheek and whispered, \"Don't cry, it's not worth it.\"\nVictoria looked at his broad palm, wiped away her tears, and pulled out a card from her bag, handing it to Nora. \"This is all my money. Take it and leave. From now on, I owe you nothing.\"\nNora eagerly took the card and stuffed it into her pocket. She helped Bobby up and didn't look back at Victoria.\nVictoria stood there, watching them leave, tears streaming down her face.\nNora, Bobby, my last bit of affection for you is gone.\nWilliam pulled Victoria into his arms, gently patting her back and soothing her, \"It's okay, Victoria. It's over. Don't cry.\"",

The sorrow in her heart slowly began to fade.\nShe looked up, her tear-streaked face meeting William's handsome features, and said earnestly, \"William, thanks for helping me today. I really mean it.\"\nIf it weren't for William, she might have been pushed to the edge by Nora and Bobby!\nDespite the harshness she had faced, Victoria still felt genuine gratitude.\nWilliam felt his heart soften completely.\nHe gently kissed her lips, tenderly and meticulously.\nIt wasn't until Victoria found it hard to breathe that he reluctantly let go.\nWith a husky voice close to her ear, William whispered, \"Silly girl, you don't need to thank me.\"\nVictoria stared blankly at his handsome face, so close to hers.\nHis eyes were deep and captivating, focused intently on her.\nAfter a moment, Victoria spoke, \"William, I know you care about me. Every time I'm at my lowest and most helpless, it's you who helps me.\"\nWilliam smiled, \"As long as you know.\"\n\"But I also know you'll marry Alice. She's special to you, isn't she?\" Victoria asked softly.\nWilliam's smile froze. After a moment, he replied lightly, \"Yeah.\"\nVictoria's lips pressed together, a hint of disappointment in her eyes. She sighed softly, \"I can't be your mistress, but we can still be friends.\"\n\"Friends?\" William scoffed, as if mocking her naivety.\n\"Yeah.\" Victoria looked at him steadily. \"I know someone like me isn't qualified to be your friend...\"\n\"What are you trying to say?\" William's patience wore thin, cutting her off.\nVictoria bit her lip, mustering the courage to say, \"Can we end this sordid relationship? I don't want to be your hidden mistress anymore. Can I stay by your side as a friend instead?\"\nThe room fell silent.\nAfter a long pause, William's thin lips curved slightly as he asked, \"Are you sure?\"\nVictoria nodded firmly, \"I'm sure.\"\nWilliam's eyes darkened. After a long while, he slowly said, \"Alright, but I have one condition.\"\nVictoria breathed a sigh of relief and quickly nodded, \"What is it?\"\nWilliam's long fingers brushed her soft lips as he murmured, \"I can agree to let you be my 'friend.' I can even help with your mother's medical bills and your father's debt as a 'friend.' But you have to stay with me for one more month, willingly, treating me as your 'husband.'\"\n\"H-husband!\" Victoria's eyes widened in disbelief.\nWilliam raised an eyebrow, \"Not willing? Then forget it.\"\n\"No!\" Victoria shook her head frantically, waving her hands, \"I agree, I agree.\"\nIt's just one month, she thought. It will pass in the blink of an eye.\n\"Good girl.\" William chuckled, pecking her nose. \"For this month, remember to behave. Keep your distance from other men, care for me in daily life, and satisfy me in bed.\"\n\"What?\" Victoria was stunned.\n\"Is there a problem?\" William seemed to see through her confusion, frowning slightly.\nVictoria shook her head, \"N-no.\"\nWilliam's lips curved into a mischievous smile as he leaned close to her ear, whispering, \"Then you can start now.\"\n\"Start what?\" Victoria blinked in confusion.\n\"Of course, pleasing me!\" William's tone was casual, as if discussing the weather.\nVictoria snapped out of her daze, her face turning bright red. She quickly waved her hands in refusal.\n\"We're still in the hospital, it's not appropriate,\" Victoria stammered.\nWilliam's Adam's apple bobbed, his husky voice filled with temptation, \"Haven't we done enough in the hospital already?\"\n\"But I'm really not in the mood right now,\" Victoria's voice weakened, tears still clinging to her face, making her look pitiful.\nWilliam's desire grew stronger, his gaze fixed on her luscious lips. His voice was hoarse as he said, \"If you don't want to, you can use your mouth.\"\nVictoria's mind went blank, her face turning as red as a cooked shrimp.\nShe pushed him away angrily, \"William, you're a jerk!\"\nWilliam raised an eyebrow playfully, his large hand gripping her waist, pulling her closer.\n\"Not willing? Then the one-month deal is off.\"\n\"No!\" Victoria was terrified. She immediately relented, \"I will, I will!\"\nWilliam's lips curved into a smile as he sat on the couch, motioning for her to come over.\nVictoria glared at him, gritting her teeth, and slowly moved towards him, leaning over his lap.\nWilliam's large hand caressed her round bottom through her pants, making Victoria shiver slightly.\nHe adjusted his already semi-erect member, breathing heavily, his deep voice magnetic and enticing, \"Baby, hurry up.\"\nVictoria's face turned bright red as she unzipped his pants, her pink tongue tentatively licking his erect member, the taste making her feel nauseous.\nShe slowly sucked, her movements clumsy, causing William to gasp, a rush of heat surging to his lower body.\nFeeling his member growing larger in her mouth, Victoria panicked and pleaded, \"I can't take it all!\"\nShe covered her mouth, gagging, then looked up at William with watery eyes, \"I can't.\"\nHer eyes were red, her expression timid, making William's gaze even more intense. He pressed her head down again, his voice hoarse as he coaxed, \"Good girl, just a little longer.\"\nVictoria was forced to open her mouth wide, allowing William's member to thrust in and out roughly.\nHis member was hot and swollen, and Victoria endured the discomfort, trying to keep up with his rhythm, her lips moving continuously.\nFinally, William let out a low growl, his member releasing, spraying a warm liquid onto Victoria's face, sliding down her neck, leaving a trail of intimacy.",

For this month, you have to treat me like your 'husband.' Did you forget?\"\nVictoria was stunned for a moment. \"But, I...\"\n\"Or you could quit your job and be my secretary again, like before. Then I wouldn't have to move in with you.\"\n\"No way! I will never quit my job.\" Victoria blurted out without thinking.\nShe had put so much effort into her job at Starry Studio Gallery, and she wasn't about to lose it because of William.\nWilliam let out a satisfied grunt. \"Since you're not quitting, you have to follow my orders. Got it?\"\nReluctantly, Victoria nodded, feeling utterly trapped.\nThe next day, as soon as Victoria returned to Starry Studio Gallery, Diana handed her a task.\n\"I'm going to Harborview City to prepare for an exhibition?\" Victoria was surprised.\nDiana flipped through a thick folder of documents. \"Yes, this home design exhibition features the top designers in the industry. Your interior design for the Bridges family's home goods building last time was exactly what they wanted. So, Mr. Bridges specifically requested you to go to Harborview City to set up their exhibition.\"\nVictoria bit her lip, hesitated for a moment, and then asked tentatively, \"Ms. Simpson, am I going alone?\"\nIt was her first time organizing an exhibition by herself, and she was understandably nervous about messing it up.\nDiana glanced at Victoria and said nonchalantly, \"What, are you scared?\"\nVictoria shook her head. \"No, I'm just worried.\"\nDiana put down the folder, walked to the table, took a sip of coffee, and said slowly, \"I believe you can handle this job. Be confident!\"\n\"Thank you.\" Victoria smiled gratefully. \"I know what to do now. I'll start packing and get ready to leave.\"\n\"Good.\" Diana nodded. \"Go ahead!\"\nVictoria packed her bags and sent William a message explaining the situation.\nSince he was going on a business trip too, her being away for a few days wouldn't affect their arrangement.\nAfter checking in, Victoria sat in the waiting area, bored, waiting for her flight to take off.\nSuddenly, someone tapped her on the shoulder.\n\"Ms. Carter, what are you doing here?\" A man exclaimed in surprise. \"Are you going to Harborview City too?\"\nVictoria turned around to see Alton's beaming face.\nSince they last met at Sofia's apology dinner, they hadn't been in touch. Running into him here felt surreal.\nVictoria nodded and smiled. \"Yes, I am.\"\nAlton's eyes sparkled with excitement. \"That's great! What class are you flying?\"\n\"I'm just a regular worker, so it's economy class for me,\" Victoria laughed.\n\"Come on, let me upgrade you to first class. It's over two hours, and economy is so uncomfortable!\" Alton grabbed Victoria's arm and led her to the VIP lounge without giving her a chance to refuse.\n\"No, Alton, I really can't let you spend money on me,\" Victoria quickly tried to stop him.\n\"It's no trouble. I have points, so the upgrade is free,\" Alton grinned. \"You relax here, and I'll take care of everything.\"\nVictoria couldn't argue with Alton and let him have his way.\nIn the VIP lounge, Alton eagerly brought Victoria tea, snacks, and pastries.\nVictoria couldn't help but laugh. \"Alton, you're being too kind. You're making me feel embarrassed.\"\nAlton chuckled. \"There's nothing to be embarrassed about. You're my dream girl.\"\nDream girl? Victoria coughed awkwardly.\nJust as Victoria was wondering how to respond, a deep, magnetic voice with a hint of sarcasm interrupted, \"Ms. Carter, you sure have a way of attracting admirers wherever you go.\"\nVictoria froze at the sound and looked up, meeting a pair of deep, intense eyes.\nWilliam stood at the door, one hand in his pocket, the other holding a cigarette, the grayish-blue flame flickering.\nAlton's expression turned serious, like a kid caught red-handed. \"Mr. Scott.\"\nWilliam let out a cold snort, his gaze dark and stormy.\nVictoria was about to explain when a petite, charming girl suddenly appeared behind William.\nShe wore a cream-colored cropped knit sweater and light purple skinny jeans. Her short hair was neat, her features delicate, and she had a sweet, girl-next-door look.\nHarry followed her, carrying her luggage.\nThe girl tugged on William's sleeve and asked in a coquettish tone, \"Mr. Scott, who is this lady?\"\nVictoria felt a shiver run down her spine, feeling utterly repulsed.\nBefore William could answer, Victoria quickly said, \"Hello, I'm Mr. Scott's former secretary-Victoria.\"\n\"So, you're William's former secretary.\" The girl blinked and then smiled. \"Nice to meet you, Victoria. I'm William's current secretary, Lyanna Patel.\"\nCurrent secretary?\nVictoria smiled lightly. \"Nice to meet you.\"\n\"Ms. Carter, where are you and your friend headed?\" William asked casually, his gaze sweeping over Alton.\nThere was a threatening and warning look in his eyes, making Alton step back silently, wishing he could disappear.\n\"Mr. Bridges and I just happened to run into each other here,\" Victoria emphasized the 'Mr. Bridges' part. \"The company sent me to Harborview City to set up an exhibition.\"\n\"Really?\" William raised an eyebrow. \"What a coincidence. You and Mr. Bridges must have a deep connection.\"\nVictoria could tell from his expression that William was angry again. She had sent him a message, but when she checked her phone, she realized it was still in the draft. She had forgotten to hit send.",

He leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, his handsome face stern.\nStartled, Victoria took a step back instinctively. \"William?\"\n\"Why are you avoiding me?\" William's cold gaze bore into her, a mischievous smile playing on his lips. \"Afraid I'll eat you?\"\nVictoria frowned, whispering, \"What are you doing? This is an airplane!\"\n\"So what?\"\n\"You...\"\nBefore she could finish, William's long arm shot out, pinning her against the sink. His domineering kiss silenced her protests.\nVictoria's eyes widened in shock as she struggled, but William didn't budge.\nAfter a long moment, he released her, his thumb brushing her swollen lips, his gaze locking onto her flushed, angry face. \"Didn't I tell you to stay away from other men?\"\n\"I didn't!\" Victoria gritted her teeth in defiance.\n\"Are you sure?\" William's tone lifted slightly. \"That Alton has been eyeing you quite eagerly.\"\nVictoria's anger flared. \"What nonsense are you spouting? We just ran into each other!\"\n\"The truth doesn't matter.\" William's eyes darkened as he stared at her reddened cheeks, a smirk forming on his lips. \"What matters is, I hate the way he looks at you.\"\n\"And what about you? What's with Lyanna?\" Victoria retorted, her voice cold. \"Ella and Alice weren't enough, now there's Lyanna too? Mr. Scott, you sure are busy!\"\nWilliam chuckled at her anger, his long fingers lifting her delicate chin. \"Jealous?\"\n\"Bullshit, why would I be jealous?\" Victoria turned her head, avoiding his touch.\n\"Really?\" William laughed softly. \"Then why does your tone sound so dissatisfied?\"\nVictoria had no response, glaring at him before attempting to leave.\nWilliam grabbed her, pressing her against the cold sink. \"Try running off again.\"\nVictoria slapped his firm arm. \"Let go of me, I don't want to deal with you.\"\nWilliam glanced at her puffed-up face, his eyes growing darker. He leaned in closer, his voice husky. \"Move again, and I won't mind getting a little intimate right here.\"\nVictoria froze, feeling something pressing against her, disbelief in her eyes. \"Are you crazy? This is an airplane.\"\nWilliam's lips curled into a wicked smile. \"That's why I told you not to move. I can't guarantee what I'll do otherwise.\"\n\"You're a jerk,\" Victoria spat angrily.\n\"I can be worse,\" William's smile grew more sinister as he blew into her ear. \"Guess what kind of beastly things I might do?\"\nVictoria's body stiffened, her breath catching.\nSeeing her stop struggling, William slowly lifted her chin, explaining, \"Lyanna is my uncle's friend's daughter. She's interning in her senior year, and I needed a secretary. My uncle asked me to take her on for a few months. He's family, so I couldn't refuse.\"\nVictoria eyed him suspiciously, trying to find any hint of deceit on his handsome face.\nBut all she saw was calmness.\n\"I'm back in Harborview City because my grandfather wants to see me, and my uncle's family just moved back. I had to meet them, so I brought her along. Nothing more.\"\nWilliam finished, lowering his head to peck her soft lips, chuckling softly. \"Victoria, whether you believe it or not, I only desire you. Other women don't interest me.\"\n\"You...\"\nVictoria was about to speak when the restroom door was knocked on. \"What's taking so long in there? Are you done yet?\"\nVictoria's face turned crimson as she glared at William, flustered. \"Wait, just a moment.\" \nVictoria quickly fixed her appearance and hurried out of the restroom.\nWilliam raised an eyebrow, amused by her hasty retreat, a smile spreading across his face.\nAs a passenger tried to enter, William casually stepped out, showing no sign of embarrassment, and walked away calmly.\nThe passenger, understanding the situation, smiled knowingly. \"Young man, it's good to have passion.\"\nWilliam smiled back, nodding in agreement.\nVictoria returned to her seat, her face still flushed. Alton immediately leaned in, concerned. \"Victoria, why is your face so red?\"\nVictoria coughed awkwardly, mumbling, \"Maybe it's too stuffy on the plane.\"\nAlton nodded. \"Planes can be quite warm.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Victoria replied absentmindedly.\nPassing by, William suddenly chuckled, drawing both Alton and Victoria's attention.\nHe stood there, looking down at Victoria. \"The plane's air conditioning is perfect, and there's a fresh air system. If you're feeling warm, it must be psychological.\"\nVictoria's cheeks burned even more. She knew William was mocking her, but she couldn't argue since he was right.\nWilliam glanced at Alton. \"You two chat.\"\nWith that, he walked away with long strides.\nAfter William left, Alton looked at Victoria, worried. \"Victoria, did he bother you?\"",

She immediately felt a sense of alarm.\nCould it be that William, besides Ella and Alice, also had something going on with Victoria?\nFeeling a bit panicked, Lyanna quickly tugged on William's sleeve. \"William.\"\nWilliam turned his head. \"What's up?\"\n\"I...\" Lyanna glanced at Victoria, then lowered her head, unsure of what to say.\n\"Don't overthink it. Just rest for a bit.\" William gently ruffled Lyanna's hair to comfort her.\n\"Okay.\" Lyanna nodded and obediently sat back in her seat, but she kept sneaking glances at William and Victoria out of the corner of her eye.\nDuring the flight, the two didn't exchange any words.\nTwo hours later, the plane landed at Harborview City's international airport. As soon as the plane stopped, William received a call from Alice.\nVictoria stood behind him with her bag, ready to disembark. William glanced at her and stepped aside to take the call.\n\"Alice.\"\nHearing his familiar voice, Alice immediately became excited and quickly asked, \"Where are you? You didn't come home last night, and when I went to the office today, the receptionist said you were on a business trip.\"\n\"Yeah, I was just on the plane.\"\nAlice was silent for a moment, then sighed. \"You didn't tell me you were going on a business trip. I was so worried.\"\nWilliam paused before speaking gently, \"Sorry, it was a bit rushed. I was planning to tell you after I got off the plane.\"\nSeeing how tenderly he spoke, Victoria didn't need to hear the content to know who he was talking to.\nWilliam had a woman at home, was currently with another woman, yet he still wouldn't let go of Victoria.\nLuckily, she never fantasized about being with him; otherwise, it would have been painful.\nJust like Ella and Alice, each crazier than the last.\nAs she was lost in thought, Lyanna suddenly asked loudly, \"Victoria, which hotel are you staying at?\"\nHer voice was so loud that it startled Victoria and was heard by Alice on the other end of the call.\n\"Victoria?\" Alice's face instantly fell, and she questioned William, \"Did you bring Victoria to Harborview City too?\"\nWilliam's face darkened as he glanced at Lyanna, a hint of anger in his eyes.\nLyanna shrank back and lowered her head.\nWilliam walked off the plane quickly, explaining to Alice on the phone, \"We just ran into each other.\"\nLyanna watched him walk ahead and hurried to follow.\nAlton, seeing William leave, finally dared to speak. \"Victoria, let's get off too.\"\nVictoria nodded, and they exited the plane together.\nOutside the airport, a luxury car was already waiting for Alton.\n\"Victoria, which hotel are you staying at? I'll give you a ride!\" Alton offered warmly.\n\"No need to trouble you, I'll just take a cab.\" Victoria politely declined.\n\"You're my friend, and Harborview City is my hometown. It's no trouble at all. Or do you not consider me a friend?\" Alton pretended to be upset, pouting.\n\"That's not what I meant.\" Victoria smiled helplessly. \"I just don't want to be a bother.\"\n\"It's no bother at all,\" Alton insisted, gently taking her arm to guide her into the car.\n\"Ms. Carter, where are you headed?\" A cold voice cut through the air.\nVictoria turned to see William, dressed in a sharp black suit, his tie perfectly in place, exuding an air of elegance and authority.\nWith one hand in his pocket, he looked at Victoria with a faint, mocking smile, a hint of coldness in his eyes.\nVictoria shivered involuntarily.\nAlton immediately released her arm and stepped back slightly.\nWilliam's demeanor was indeed intimidating.\n\"I, I'm going to the hotel,\" Victoria managed to say.\nWilliam responded indifferently, then looked up, his tone laced with sarcasm. \"Moving fast, aren't you? Already heading to the hotel together?\"\n\"No, no, no,\" Alton quickly explained. \"I'm just giving Ms. Carter a ride to the hotel.\"\nWilliam glanced at Victoria. \"Is that so?\"\nVictoria gritted her teeth. \"Yes!\"\nWilliam smirked, then turned to Alton. \"In that case, no need to trouble you, Mr. Bridges. Ms. Carter is staying at the same hotel as me. I'll take her.\"\nAlton looked at Victoria, hesitated for a moment, then reluctantly agreed. \"Alright.\"\nWilliam, not wanting to waste more words, turned to Victoria. \"Let's go.\"\nHe started walking, and after a moment's hesitation, Victoria followed.\nShe could tell William was angry. Defying him now would only lead to trouble. It was better to go along with him and avoid future issues.\nThey got into the Lincoln Town Car that had come to pick up William. Harry sat in the front seat, and Lyanna, seeing Victoria, was surprised. \"Ms. Carter, are you coming with us?\"\nVictoria forced a smile, trying to think of a response, when she suddenly felt a sharp pain in her waist. She turned to glare at William.\nHe had sneakily slipped his hand under her shirt and pinched her!\nWilliam raised an eyebrow, a mischievous smile playing on his lips.\nVictoria clenched her teeth, suppressing her anger, and glared at William before turning back to Lyanna. \"I'm staying at the same hotel as you. Mr. Scott kindly offered me a ride.\"\nLyanna blinked, looking between Victoria and William, then nodded suspiciously.\nThe car fell silent. Harry glanced at Lyanna and Victoria through the rearview mirror, his lips twitching. He silently cursed William for being shameless.\nVictoria kept her head down, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible.\nWilliam didn't make things difficult for her and didn't speak to her during the ride.\nEach lost in their own thoughts, they soon arrived at the hotel.\nWilliam got out, glanced at Victoria, and then walked toward the hotel entrance.\nVictoria understood his look and, thinking of their one-month agreement, reluctantly followed.\nLyanna watched their backs with displeasure.\nAt the front desk, Lyanna smiled and said, \"Ms. Carter, this place isn't cheap. Your company must be generous to book you a room here.\"",

Since Alvin's accident, she hadn't stayed in such a nice hotel.\nThe room had spacious, bright floor-to-ceiling windows, a massage bathtub, a leather sofa, and a large, soft waterbed.\nVictoria rolled around on the bed, feeling incredibly comfortable.\nShe filled the bathtub with water, scattered the petals provided by the hotel, turned on some music, and finally slipped into the tub, closing her eyes to enjoy the rare moment of relaxation.\nSuddenly, she felt the water ripple beside her, and a cold body pressed against her.\nShe opened her eyes abruptly and saw a pair of deep, dark eyes staring back at her.\n\"William? What are you doing here?\"\nWilliam leisurely took off his jacket and sweater, revealing his strong, muscular chest.\n\"What, am I not welcome here?\" he asked, raising an eyebrow, his long fingers trailing along her neck and chest.\nVictoria felt flustered by his touch and shrank back into the water. \"Of course not.\" As soon as she spoke, she found herself spun around, her body pressed against the side of the tub by William.\nHis tall, muscular frame was right next to her, his hot breath on her ear.\nA faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips.\nVictoria's body stiffened, and she struggled slightly, only to be held tighter.\n\"Don't move!\" His voice was low and sexy. \"Be good and take a bath with me.\"\nWith that, he guided her right hand down to touch his hard, hot erection, making Victoria's face flush with embarrassment.\nWilliam looked at her, his Adam's apple bobbing, and kissed her forehead before grabbing the body wash to lather her up.\nThe warm, slippery sensation made Victoria shiver.\nWilliam's large hands felt like they were on fire.\nShe squirmed, unsure of what to do, which only made him more aggressive. She finally let out a soft whimper, almost begging.\nWilliam's eyes grew darker, his deep, magnetic voice barely restrained.\n\"Call me 'honey.'\" He commanded.\nVictoria stared at him, stunned.\nWilliam frowned slightly. \"Or you will see what happens!\"\nA dangerous glint appeared in his eyes, and Victoria quickly fell silent.\nAfter a moment, she softly said, \"Honey.\"\nWilliam nodded in satisfaction and continued washing her, the soft bath sponge covered in bubbles, rubbing against her delicate skin, causing her to shiver.\nAs he washed her, he teased her with his fingers, the sensation so ticklish that Victoria couldn't help but squeeze her legs together.\nShe let out a soft moan, her voice sweet and lingering.\nWilliam chuckled lowly, dipping his finger in the body wash, and slid his hand between her legs, easily finding her tight, sensitive spot, gently rubbing it, making Victoria moan.\n\"Victoria, does it feel good?\" he asked teasingly, his voice seductive.\nVictoria's mind went blank, her cheeks flushed, her eyes watery and captivating.\n\"Yes, it feels good,\" she stammered.\nWilliam smirked, quickening his pace.\nVictoria was almost out of breath from his teasing, but the pleasure coursing through her body made her crave more.\nShe let out a muffled groan.\nWilliam glanced at her flushed, alluring face, his throat tightening, and he spoke in a rough voice, \"Victoria, do you want to feel even better?\"\nHis deep voice was filled with intense desire, like a catalyst, making Victoria feel lightheaded.\nBiting her lip, she nodded shyly.\nWilliam's eyes darkened, and he leaned closer to Victoria, his voice low, \"Then enjoy it.\"\nBefore Victoria could react, he lifted her legs around his waist and slowly entered her wet, eager body, expertly finding her sensitive spot.\nIn an instant, every pore in her body opened up, and Victoria arched her back, her face full of longing.\nSeeing her desperate expression, William's lips curled into a playful smile.\nHe pulled out and entered again, slowly thrusting.\nVictoria couldn't help but moan.\nHis movements were just right, each thrust hitting her most sensitive spot, making her squirm as if trying to merge with him.\nWilliam's eyes grew darker, and his grip tightened.\nVictoria's body convulsed with pleasure, her arms wrapped around his neck, her legs tightly around his lean waist.\nShe couldn't control her screams, her voice sweet and seductive, making William's blood boil, his movements becoming more frantic and urgent, as if he wanted to devour her.\nVictoria was left weak and dazed, clinging to his shoulders, letting him have his way.\nAfter a while, Victoria collapsed in his arms.\nBut William's erection was still inside her, feeling the foreign object connecting them, Victoria couldn't help but protest, \"Get out.\"\nWilliam didn't respond, tightening his arm around her waist, his lips brushing her ear, \"Move again, and I promise you won't be able to get out of bed tonight.\"\nVictoria froze, not daring to move.\nSeeing her finally calm down, William slowly pulled out, and Victoria sighed in relief.\nWilliam smiled at her, \"I helped you with your bath. Aren't you going to help me with mine?\"\nHis tone was teasing, making Victoria's face turn bright red.\nWilliam's lips curled into a wicked smile, and he pinched her earlobe, \"Victoria, help me.\"\nHis voice was low and husky, almost hypnotic, tempting her.\nVictoria swallowed hard and picked up the bath sponge, lathering it with body wash to clean him.\nEven though they had done this many times, Victoria had never looked at his body so closely.\nWilliam was perfect!\nHis body was incredible, with firm, even muscles, a tight eight-pack, and a perfectly shaped, firm butt. Even though his erection had subsided, it was still intimidating, exuding a powerful masculine charm.\nVictoria glanced at his penis and quickly looked away.\nIt was too much.\nVictoria forced herself to focus, carefully washing him.\nWilliam enjoyed her attention, a faint smile on his lips.\nAs they were busy, there was a sudden knock on the door.",

        "content": "\"Ms. Carter.\" Lyanna's voice cut through the room.\nVictoria froze, her face turning awkward.\nWilliam frowned. What did Lyanna want now?\nOutside the door, Lyanna, puzzled by the silence, raised her voice a bit. \"Ms. Carter, you there?\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together, glanced at William, and called out, \"Yeah, I'm here. What's up?\"\nIgnoring William's darkening expression, she answered while getting dressed.\n\"Ms. Carter, could you open the door?\" Lyanna asked politely.\nVictoria hesitated for a moment, then walked over and opened the door.\nLyanna looked surprised to see Victoria standing there in bathrobe.\n\"I was just taking a shower,\" Victoria explained, noticing Lyanna's gaze lingering on her neck. She quickly covered it, a hint of panic on her face.\nLyanna awkwardly looked away.\n\"I was just wondering if you've seen William. He's not in his room, and I can't reach him by phone,\" Lyanna said, glancing around the room but seeing nothing.\nVictoria stammered, then feigned ignorance. \"I don't know. Maybe Mr. Scott had something to take care of.\"\nA flash of disdain crossed Lyanna's eyes as she looked at Victoria. Her tone turned harsh. \"Ms. Carter, you're just William's former secretary. You should keep your distance from him. Not everyone can cling to William.\"\nVictoria's expression turned cold.\n\"How I interact with Mr. Scott is our business, not yours!\" She shot Lyanna a frosty look and slammed the door shut.\nLyanna clenched her fists in anger as she stared at the closed door.\n'Damn Victoria, how dare you disrespect me like that!' she cursed under her breath.\nLyanna stomped her foot in frustration and ran off.\nAs soon as Victoria closed the door, William pinned her against it.\n\"Ms. Carter, you're quite bold!\" He lifted her chin, his gaze intense.\nVictoria pouted, displeased. \"You know she likes you. Why do you keep her around?\"\n\"She likes me?\" William sneered. \"Lots of people like me. I'm only tolerating her because of my uncle.\"\n\"Well, you sure tolerate a lot of women,\" Victoria muttered.\nWilliam found her disgruntled tone amusing.\nHe pinched her cheek and laughed. \"Are you jealous?\"\nVictoria swatted his hand away, scoffing. \"Jealous? Are you kidding?\"\nShe was just a mistress he paid for. She had no right to be jealous of the women around William.\nWilliam's eyes narrowed dangerously as he stared at her.\nVictoria felt a bit scared under his gaze and took a step back.\nShe nervously adjusted her collar and asked cautiously, \"Mr. Scott, do you have any other instructions?\"\nWilliam didn't respond, just continued to look at her with an unreadable expression.\nAfter a long moment, he suddenly bent down and scooped her up.\nVictoria screamed in surprise as he tossed her onto the bed.\nThe next moment, he was all over her, kissing her face, neck, and collarbone.\nBy the time William was done, Victoria's body was covered in hickeys, her skin flushed, looking particularly enticing.\nWilliam bit her ear gently. \"Now do you see how powerful I am?\"\nVictoria's face was flushed, her eyes slightly red. She glared at him. \"Jerk!\"\nWilliam laughed, a low chuckle. \"Jerk?\" He traced her face with his long fingers. \"Well, I'll take that as a compliment.\"\nVictoria grabbed his hand, wary, as if facing a great enemy.\nWilliam found it amusing, kissed her on the cheek, and got out of bed. \"Hungry? Let's grab a bite.\"\nVictoria was indeed starving. She sat on the edge of the bed for a moment before getting up to change and put on makeup to cover the marks on her neck.\nWilliam watched her busy figure, his gaze deepening.\nDownstairs in the restaurant, Harry and Lyanna were already dining. When they saw the two of them come down, they immediately approached.\nVictoria felt Lyanna's intense gaze as soon as she sat down at the table. She frowned.\nLyanna glanced at Victoria with a look of disdain.\nVictoria felt a surge of irritation.\nWilliam gave Lyanna a brief glance before sitting down and sipping the soup in front of him.\n\"William, where did you go?\" Lyanna asked sweetly.\nWilliam put down his spoon. \"Had some business to take care of.\"\n\"Then how did you run into Ms. Carter?\" Lyanna asked tentatively. She had been shocked to see Victoria with him earlier.\nVictoria's heart skipped a beat. She looked at William, who was calmly drinking his soup, showing no intention of responding.\nVictoria quickly answered, \"It was an old client. Mr. Scott asked me to come along.\"\nLyanna's eyes darted around, then she smiled. \"But Ms. Carter, you've resigned. It's more appropriate for me to handle such matters since I'm William's secretary now.\"\nHer words were clearly laced with hostility.\nWilliam set down his spoon and looked at Lyanna coldly. \"Do I need your permission to decide who accompanies me?\"\nHis tone was calm but carried a strong sense of authority.\nLyanna's body trembled, and she lowered her head. \"I didn't mean it that way.\"\nWilliam smirked. \"If that's the case, then stay quiet.\"\nThough his words were light, they carried an undeniable command. Lyanna bit her lip, tears welling up but held back due to the setting.\nShe hated Victoria! Why did William always side with her?\nVictoria initially thought William was too harsh on Lyanna, but seeing Lyanna's hateful glare, she felt she deserved it.\nIt wasn't Victoria who was being harsh. If Lyanna wanted to blame someone, it should be William, not her. It was absurd!\nLyanna ate a few bites of her meal, then excused herself, glaring at Victoria one last time before leaving.\nVictoria pretended not to notice and continued eating.\nThe dinner was lavish, with a variety of dishes, but Victoria had no appetite.\nWilliam ate gracefully, his movements slow and deliberate, making him a pleasure to watch.\nVictoria couldn't help but steal a few glances, finding him more and more handsome.\n\"Have you seen enough?\" William suddenly stopped eating and looked at her.\nVictoria quickly averted her gaze, shoveling a few bites of food into her mouth. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\nWilliam's smile grew more mischievous.\nAs they ate, a woman at a nearby table suddenly exclaimed, \"It's snowing!\"",

        "content": "Victoria gazed out the window, and sure enough, she saw snowflakes drifting down, swirling beautifully.\nWatching the snowflakes dance, Victoria was momentarily stunned. Suddenly, she remembered it was snowing the day Alvin was arrested.\nIn the blink of an eye, Alvin had already been in prison for two years.\nTime flies so fast, and Christmas was just a month away.\nVictoria's nose tingled with a hint of sadness.\nWilliam noticed the subtle change in Victoria's expression, his eyes flickering thoughtfully.\nHe then stood up, pulled Victoria from her seat, and helped her into a thick coat and scarf. \"Come on, let's go for a walk.\"\nVictoria was taken aback, not understanding why William suddenly wanted to go for a walk tonight.\nShe nodded and followed William outside.\nThe night wind blew, messing up Victoria's hair.\nThe dim streetlights illuminated their clasped hands.\nVictoria's hand was cold and soft, but touching it brought a sense of warmth.\nWilliam tightened his grip on her hand, walking forward with steady steps, not looking back.\nThey walked side by side, William glancing at her. She walked with her head down like a docile little kitten, her long eyelashes covering her eyes.\nWilliam suddenly laughed, his laughter filled with joy.\nVictoria looked up at him in confusion. \"What are you laughing at?\"\nWilliam chuckled and ruffled her hair. \"Nothing.\"\nHe seemed to be in a very good mood.\nVictoria blinked and didn't ask further.\nThis moment was too beautiful, so beautiful that it made one forget the passage of time.\nShe didn't want to break it.\nColorful lights twinkled, and the surroundings were filled with a strong Christmas atmosphere. The store windows were adorned with vibrant decorations.\nThey walked side by side on the wide street, a thin layer of snow underfoot, making a rhythmic crunching sound.\nWalking in the cold wind, Victoria couldn't help but shiver. William considerately took off his coat and draped it over her shoulders.\n\"Put it on,\" he said softly.\nVictoria shook her head. \"It's okay.\"\nWilliam frowned slightly and forcefully wrapped the coat around her, his tone leaving no room for refusal. \"You must wear it!\"\nHis tone was so domineering that Victoria eventually gave in, letting William wrap the coat around her.\nThey continued walking. When they passed a coffee shop, Victoria stopped.\nIt seemed like a long time since she had enjoyed her time in a café. The last time was back in college when she still had a bright future ahead.\nWilliam followed Victoria's gaze to the coffee shop and said lightly, \"Want to go in?\"\nVictoria hesitated for a moment but couldn't resist her inner desire. \"Okay, thank you.\"\nThey entered the shop, which was quite crowded. Many people were holding steaming cups of coffee, enjoying the warmth.\nVictoria ordered two lattes and pushed one in front of William. \"You should try it. It's really good.\"\nWilliam glanced at her, then picked up the straw and took a sip.\nAfter tasting it, he stared at her with a complex expression for a few seconds before finally speaking. \"It's too sweet.\"\nVictoria was momentarily speechless and silently sipped her latte.\nHolding their warm lattes, they continued strolling and arrived at a square where a giant Christmas tree was set up, adorned with exquisite lights, shining brightly under the falling snow.\nVictoria was captivated and couldn't help but look at it a few more times.\nWilliam took the opportunity to wrap his arm around Victoria's shoulders, leaning close to her ear. \"Christmas is coming soon. If you have any wishes, just tell me. This year, I'll be your Santa Claus.\"\nVictoria's heart skipped a beat, and she looked up at him in surprise. \"You want to grant my wish?\"\n\"Yes,\" William said with a gentle smile.\nVictoria bit her lip, sighed, and smiled bitterly. \"My wish is impossible to fulfill.\"\n\"Is there a wish I can't fulfill?\" William raised an eyebrow.\nVictoria smiled but didn't say anything.\n\"Tell me,\" William urged with interest.\nVictoria hesitated for a moment but finally mustered the courage to voice her wish. \"I wish my dad could be released from prison so our family could spend Christmas together.\"\nWilliam fell silent after hearing this.\nVictoria knew this wish was difficult to achieve. Seeing William's silence, she didn't press further.\nThe mood between them grew quiet.\nThe snow fell heavier, and William hailed a cab, taking Victoria back to the hotel. They went to their respective rooms.\nWilliam didn't come to see her again.\nVictoria knew that her relationship with William couldn't be exposed.\nIt was impossible that William didn't have any feelings for her.\nBut they both knew that the gap between them was too wide, with too many issues beyond just their family backgrounds.\nWilliam maintained a physical relationship with her, helped her pay off debts, covered Nora's medical bills, and protected her when she was in trouble. But he would never publicly acknowledge her as his girlfriend.\nVictoria could never become his wife.\nWilliam might like her, but that affection hadn't reached the level of love, let alone the point where he couldn't live without her.\nTheir current warmth or intimacy was fleeting; they had no future together.\nThe next day, Victoria checked out of the hotel and moved to the one arranged by Starry Studio Gallery.\nAlthough it was much less luxurious than the one William had booked, at least she could stay there quietly without so many worries.\nVictoria stood in the center of the exhibition hall, her heart surging with excitement.\nIt was empty now, waiting to be transformed into a creative and cozy home display area by her.\nShe took a deep breath and prepared to start her layout work.\nVictoria sketched her initial ideas on the blueprint. She envisioned an open-plan living and dining area to showcase the fluidity and flexibility of modern home design.\nAs she focused on marking the blueprint, Alton arrived.\nThe exhibition was hosted by the Bridges Group, and Alton, as the heir to the Bridges family, was naturally involved.\nSeeing Victoria, he smiled warmly. \"Victoria, are you working on the design?\"\nVictoria put down her pen and nodded politely. \"Yes.\"\nAlton walked over, his gaze falling on the design draft on the table. He smiled and praised, \"It looks great. As expected of Joshua's student.\"\n\"You're too kind,\" Victoria said modestly.\nVictoria began directing the staff to move in the furniture and arrange it according to her design. Alton helped out on the side.\nAfter finishing all the work, Victoria breathed a sigh of relief, stretched, and looked at the clock on the wall. It was already 8:30 PM.\nSeeing the fatigue on her face, Alton smiled and said, \"You must be exhausted. Let me take you back to rest.\"",

Victoria leaned back in the seat and closed her eyes, pretending to nap.\nAlton glanced at Victoria through the rearview mirror. She seemed asleep with a faint smile, looking serene and charming.\nHe turned his attention back to the road and drove towards the hotel.\nThe hotel was only a ten-minute drive from the exhibition center. Before long, Alton's car pulled up in front of the hotel.\nHe turned to look at the still-sleeping Victoria and gently called, \"Victoria, wake up. We're here.\"\nHearing this, Victoria opened her eyes, rubbed her throbbing forehead, and prepared to get out of the car.\nJust then, her phone rang. The caller ID showed it was William.\nShe swiped to answer.\n\"Where are you?\" William's voice was cold.\n\"At the hotel,\" Victoria replied honestly.\n\"Who are you with?\" His tone was low, with a hint of anger.\nVictoria frowned, disliking his aggressive attitude, but given their current relationship, she patiently explained, \"A colleague.\"\n\"Male or female?\"\n\"Female,\" Victoria lied quietly, turning away.\nThe call ended abruptly.\nVictoria held the phone, stunned for a moment, then snapped out of it and smiled apologetically at Alton as she prepared to get out of the car.\nAlton, ever the gentleman, opened the car door and helped her out.\n\"Thanks,\" Victoria said, taking a step forward when suddenly, someone grabbed her arm, pulling her back.\nStartled, she didn't have time to react before she was enveloped in William's embrace, his firm chest pressing against her, his unique scent filling her nose.\n\"What are you doing here?\" Victoria looked up at William, her almond-shaped eyes wide with surprise.\nShe felt the heat radiating from William, transferring through their contact, making her whole body tense.\n\"If I hadn't come, would you have run off with another man?\" William's voice was low and hoarse, filled with restraint.\nVictoria blinked her wet eyes, looking innocent. \"I wouldn't.\"\nAlton, also startled by William's sudden appearance, quickly greeted, \"Mr. Scott!\"\nWilliam shot him a cold glance. \"Aren't you leaving?\"\nAlton awkwardly cleared his throat, touched his nose, and wisely stepped aside, waving to Victoria. \"I'm leaving now.\"\nWith that, he quickly got into his car and drove off.\nOnly after Alton's car disappeared did William shift his gaze back to Victoria.\nHis eyes were like magnets, making Victoria feel like she was being roasted. She struggled to break free. \"William, can you let go of me?\"\nHe didn't budge, holding her tightly, his tone lazy. \"No.\"\nVictoria frowned, trying to reason. \"Alton's gone.\"\n\"So what? It doesn't concern us, does it?\"\n\"But...\"\nWilliam's gaze turned menacing, his voice icy. \"Didn't you say you were with a female colleague?\"\nVictoria fell silent, feeling a chill. Now she wished she could slap herself for lying.\nVictoria looked up, timidly explaining, \"I was just afraid you'd be mad.\"\nWilliam snorted, his expression softening a bit. \"Victoria, do you really not know what Alton's intentions are?\"\nVictoria was taken aback, then nodded. \"He did pursue me, but I clearly rejected him. Now we're just colleagues!\"\nAs soon as she finished speaking, William kissed her hard, silencing her.\nAfter a long time, William finally let her go.\nHis lips were red from the kiss, his eyes deep, burning with anger.\n\"I've told you many times to stay away from other men. Are you ignoring me?\"\nVictoria bit her lip, stubbornly replying, \"I'm not. Do you expect me to limit my work interactions? William, we only have a one-month deal. Don't you think you're overstepping?\"\n\"Say that again.\" His tone dropped to freezing.\nVictoria pressed her lips together, meeting his gaze without fear.\nWilliam stared at her for a long time before finally giving in. He grabbed her chin, speaking harshly. \"Don't let me catch you getting close to other men again, or else...\"\n\"I'm hungry!\" Victoria suddenly interrupted.\nWilliam stared at her, saying nothing.\nVictoria continued, \"I'm starving.\"\nHer pleading look made it impossible for William to stay angry. He finally relented.\nHe took out his phone, made a quick call, and then hung up.\n\"Come with me.\"\nHe turned and walked ahead, his long strides quickly putting distance between them. When he noticed Victoria wasn't following, he stopped and waited.\nVictoria pointed to her legs, looking pitiful. \"I'm too tired to walk.\"\nWilliam frowned, walked back to her, and crouched down. \"Get on. I'll carry you.\"\nHis back was broad and strong, exuding a sense of security.\nVictoria hesitated for a moment before slowly climbing on, wrapping her arms around his neck.\nWilliam stood up, supporting her, and strode forward.\nVictoria clung to his back, inhaling his scent, feeling reluctant to let go.\nHis body was much warmer than hers, with a faint smell of tobacco mixed with the sweet scent of his body wash.\n\"Victoria, if you keep moving, I'll throw you off,\" he threatened.\n\"Okay.\" Victoria obediently stayed still, lying quietly on his back.\nWilliam's lips curved into a smile.\nVictoria, resting on his shoulder, could feel her breath on his face, tickling him.\nShe couldn't resist touching his smooth, firm cheek.\nWilliam raised an eyebrow, his voice cold. \"Victoria, what are you doing?\"\n\"Nothing.\" Victoria quickly withdrew her hand, staying silent.\nWilliam, seeing her guilty look, didn't pursue it further and continued walking.\nThey remained silent until they reached the restaurant. William gently set Victoria down.\nA waiter approached.\n\"Welcome! Do you have a reservation?\" the waiter asked respectfully.\n\"Yes, a window seat on the third floor,\" William replied coolly, then led her towards the stairs.",

The rustic elegance made it feel particularly cozy.\nShe couldn't help but think to herself that the designer of this place must have great taste.\nVictoria sat down.\nWilliam didn't stand on ceremony either, pulling out a chair and sitting next to her.\nThe waiter quickly brought out the dishes, which looked and smelled amazing, making her mouth water.\nVictoria looked at the exquisite dishes on the table and swallowed hard.\n\"Go ahead and eat.\"\nVictoria nodded, picking up her utensils to start, but she paused mid-air, looking at William in confusion. \"Aren't you eating?\"\nHe glanced at her. \"I've already eaten. Don't worry about me.\"\nVictoria pouted and started eating. Her stomach was growling with hunger.\nWilliam watched her devour the food and couldn't help but chuckle. He picked up his wine glass and took a sip.\nHis gaze drifted to the window, and he suddenly noticed a familiar figure downstairs. His eyes locked onto the person through the crowd.\nThe person seemed to notice his gaze and smiled at him.\nWilliam nodded and smiled back, raising his wine glass in a greeting.\nThe person said something to their companion and then entered the restaurant.\nVictoria, focused on her food, missed the entire exchange.\nAfter she was full, Victoria planned to leave.\nAs soon as she stood up, William pulled her back down to sit beside him.\nHe took a napkin and gently wiped the corner of her mouth, whispering, \"No rush.\"\nA moment later, there was a soft knock on the door of their private room. A middle-aged man walked in, looking friendly in his well-tailored suit, with a sharp glint in his eyes.\n\"William! What a surprise to see you here!\" Wayne's voice was loud and warm.\nHe walked over, patting William on the shoulder with a kind smile.\n\"Uncle Wayne, long time no see.\" William nodded politely.\n\"Indeed, it's been a while.\" Wayne looked William over, nodding in approval. \"I heard your media and advertising company is doing exceptionally well. You must be a business genius!\"\n\"You're too kind, Uncle Wayne,\" William replied modestly.\nVictoria stayed silent, listening to their conversation.\nWilliam's uncle? So it was Wayne Scott, the current chairman of Infinity Unity Group, the most powerful company under the Scott family.\n\"William, who is this?\" Wayne finally noticed Victoria, scrutinizing her for a moment.\nWilliam glanced at Victoria. \"My former secretary.\"\n\"Really? A secretary?\" Wayne was surprised for a moment, then laughed heartily. \"You sure know how to have fun.\"\nVictoria awkwardly forced a smile. Could she pretend she hadn't heard that?\n\"What brings you here today, Uncle Wayne?\" William asked.\n\"I just got back to the country and arranged a dinner with some friends, so I came here. Didn't expect to run into you.\" Wayne smiled warmly.\nWayne looked at William with affection. \"Your grandfather has been asking about you. When will you visit him at the nursing home?\"\n\"I was planning to go today, but something came up. I'll go tomorrow.\"\nWayne nodded in satisfaction. \"Good, make sure to go early so he doesn't get upset waiting.\"\n\"Got it.\"\nAfter a few more words, Wayne left.\nHis assistant was waiting outside. Seeing Wayne come out, he quickly approached. \"Mr. Scott.\"\n\"Look into that woman,\" Wayne whispered with a serious expression.\n\"Yes, sir,\" the assistant replied, following Wayne out.\nAs soon as he left, Victoria let out a sigh of relief, finally feeling free.\nWilliam glanced at her. \"Are you afraid of my uncle?\"\nVictoria shook her head. \"Not exactly afraid, but the way he looked at me was unsettling.\"\n\"Why do you say that?\"\nVictoria shrugged, looking uneasy. \"I don't know how to describe it. He was smiling at you, but it gave me a creepy feeling, like something sinister.\"\nWilliam seemed thoughtful, his gaze deepening.\n\"William?\" Victoria called out, puzzled.\n\"It's nothing,\" William replied, snapping out of his thoughts. \"Since we're done eating, let's go.\"\n\"The hotel I'm staying at is nearby. I can go back on my own.\"\n\"Let me take you back,\" William said.\n\"Isn't that inconvenient?\" Victoria hesitated.\n\"What's inconvenient?\" William chuckled. \"What, are you afraid I'll try something?\"\nVictoria glared at him. \"Who knows? You might.\"\n\"Really?\" William leaned in closer, his warm breath brushing against her face, making her cheeks flush.\nHe bent down, his nose almost touching hers, the air between them charged with tension.\nHer heart raced, and she couldn't meet his gaze. He was too close, and she couldn't escape. Their lips brushed.\nShe stared at him, her face turning a deep shade of red, looking stunning.\nHe smiled, his voice husky and teasing. \"Since you think so, should we give it a try?\"\nHis warm breath tickled her face, sending shivers down her spine.\nVictoria pushed against his chest, moving back a bit, watching him warily.\nWilliam laughed softly at her tense expression. \"Just kidding.\"\nHe ruffled her hair affectionately. \"Silly girl, let's go. I'll take you back.\"\nVictoria bit her lip, looking at him with a mix of frustration and resignation.\nWilliam, seeing her expression, sighed and took her hand, leading her out.\nThe hotel was just a few minutes away. When they reached her room, William showed no intention of leaving.\nVictoria glared at him. \"Why aren't you leaving?\"\nWilliam looked down at her, his eyes twinkling with mischief. \"Do you want me to leave?\"\n\"Of course I do.\" She was exhausted and didn't want to deal with him any longer. She had work tomorrow.\n\"If you want me to leave, then I won't.\"\nVictoria was stunned. Was he really being this stubborn?\n\"I don't care. I'm staying here tonight.\" With that, he opened the door, lay down on the soft bed, and closed his eyes.\nVictoria was at a loss for words. Could William be any more shameless?\nShe had no choice but to give in.\nShe sighed. \"Fine, you win.\"\nShe tossed her bag on the couch and headed to the bathroom. \"I'm taking a shower.\"\nHearing the bathroom door close, William opened his eyes, a satisfied smile playing on his lips, his eyes filled with joy.",

I promise I won't try anything,\" William said, his gaze soft and a slight smile on his lips.\nVictoria eyed him skeptically, hesitating.\nWilliam's smile grew. \"Come on, it's more comfortable.\"\nStill unsure, Victoria knew William's promises in these situations were often unreliable. What if he tried something while she was asleep?\nWilliam didn't push, just watched her with that same smile.\nAfter a long pause, Victoria swallowed hard and slowly moved to the bed.\nAs soon as she lay down, a long arm wrapped around her waist. The strong scent of his cologne filled her nostrils, and his warm breath sent shivers through her, making her heart race.\nVictoria lay stiffly, not daring to move, feeling the heat from his touch on her back. She gritted her teeth and growled, \"William, don't even think about it!\"\n\"Okay,\" he murmured, his voice restrained but compliant, not moving any closer.\nVictoria sighed in relief and turned her back to him.\nShe thought she wouldn't be able to sleep, but soon, exhaustion took over, and she gradually closed her eyes.\nWilliam held her close, his chin resting against her neck, inhaling her scent as he drifted off.\nThe next morning\nWhen William woke up, Victoria was still asleep. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a serene glow on her delicate profile, making it hard to look away.\nHe watched her, a slight smile playing on his lips, feeling unusually content.\nVictoria woke up groggily, her eyes meeting William's deep gaze. His intense stare made her feel exposed.\nWilliam propped his head on one hand, lazily gazing at her.\nHis features were sharp and refined, even in a casual pose, he looked dazzlingly handsome.\nHe had a playful and teasing smile as he looked at Victoria.\nVictoria sat up abruptly, her face flushed.\nWilliam couldn't help but laugh, his eyes full of amusement. \"Morning.\"\n\"Good, good morning,\" Victoria stammered, turning her head away awkwardly.\nFor some reason, she felt more uncomfortable with this intimate, non-sexual closeness than with physical intimacy. It made them seem like a loving couple rather than something more secretive.\nShe felt it just wasn't meant for her, and she didn't like this feeling.\n\"Not getting up? Expecting something?\" William raised an eyebrow, his eyes twinkling with mischief.\nVictoria looked up, glaring at him before quickly lowering her gaze, muttering, \"I'm not like you, ready to get frisky anytime, anywhere.\"\nWilliam laughed, flipping over to pin her beneath him.\nVictoria panicked, struggling instinctively. \"What are you doing? I haven't brushed my teeth, it's gross.\"\nWilliam laughed harder. \"It's fine, I don't mind.\"\nWith that, he kissed her soft lips.\nVictoria was stunned, momentarily forgetting to push him away.\nAfter a long while, he reluctantly let her go, his voice hoarse. \"If you don't get up, I can't promise I won't do something frisky.\"\nVictoria felt something hard pressing against her, her face turning red with embarrassment and anger. She glared at him, pushed him away, and ran to the bathroom.\nWith a loud bang, she slammed the door shut.\nWilliam shook his head with a smile, feeling a strange emotion rising in his heart.\nHe suddenly thought that if life could always be like this, it wouldn't be so bad.\nAfter breakfast at the hotel restaurant, William drove Victoria to the exhibition center before heading to the nursing home.\nWilliam's grandfather, Garth Scott, lived in a nursing home in the suburbs. It was spacious, elegant, and quiet, with top-notch facilities, perfect for recuperation.\nWhen William arrived, Garth was exercising in the yard.\nSeeing William, Garth's face turned cold, and he ignored him.\nWilliam didn't mind, standing quietly by.\nWhen Garth finished exercising, William stepped forward.\nGarth glanced at him, his tone unfriendly. \"You've been gone so long, do you even remember you have a grandfather?\"\nWilliam responded indifferently, \"The company has been busy.\"\nGarth sneered, clearly not believing him. \"Busy dating your girlfriend?\"\nWilliam remained silent.\nSeeing his admission, Garth's anger flared. He struck the ground with his cane, shouting, \"I didn't agree with you marrying Ella from the Garcia family. What are they compared to the Scott family?\"\nWilliam frowned, patiently explaining, \"Grandpa, the Garcia family is a prestigious family in Silvermist City. Marrying them is mutually beneficial.\"\n\"Mutually beneficial? They're just upstarts,\" Garth scoffed, disdainful. \"But you're no better, canceling the wedding at the last minute, making both families a laughingstock. You embarrassed me in front of my old friends.\"\nWilliam said nothing.\nGarth grew angrier, raising his cane to strike William.\nWilliam didn't dodge, letting the cane hit his leg.\nSeeing William not avoiding, Garth hesitated, retracting his cane. He looked at William's stubborn, pain-enduring face, a hint of softness in his eyes. \"You're still so foolish.\"\nWilliam pressed his lips together. \"I was wrong, I shamed the Scott family.\"\n\"Enough,\" Garth sighed, shaking his head. \"But if you canceled the wedding, why are you entangled with Alice Garcia, causing such a scandal? Your actions are inappropriate.\"\nWilliam frowned. \"Grandpa, you know she suffered greatly for me. I wanted to marry Ella for her sake. Now that she's back, I must marry her.\"\nGarth pondered, seemingly considering.\n\"Fine, I can't control you young people. Decide for yourself,\" Garth said, waving his hand tiredly. \"But besides these sisters, I heard you keep a woman named Victoria?\"",

        "content": "William's eyes narrowed at the words. \"Grandpa, where'd you hear about this?\" he asked, frowning.\n\"Doesn't matter where I heard it. A guy being a bit of a playboy is no big deal, but this woman is Alvin's daughter,\" Garth said seriously. \"Have you forgotten how your parents died?\"\nAt the mention of his parents, William's fists clenched. After a moment, he spoke, \"Grandpa, don't worry. I'm only doing this to get back at Alvin.\"\n\"I hope that's the case,\" Garth said, squinting slightly. \"My health's getting worse, and I don't know how much longer I have. When are you coming back from Silvermist City?\"\nWilliam thought for a moment before replying slowly, \"New media is advancing rapidly. Silvermist City, as the economic hub of the country, has a lot of potential. Once things settle here, I'll consider other options.\"\nGarth was moved by William's words. He patted William's shoulder excitedly and praised, \"That's my grandson, always ambitious.\"\nWilliam smiled and then changed the subject, asking about Garth's health.\n\"Don't worry about me. I'm as strong as ever. You don't need to worry,\" Garth replied with a hearty laugh.\nWilliam spent the entire day at the nursing home, taking care of Garth.\nOnce the furniture was in place, Victoria started working on the soft furnishings.\nShe picked out some soft-colored throw pillows and blankets, and some modern art pieces to hang on the walls.\nBesides these soft furnishings, lighting was crucial to the success of the exhibition.\nShe bought various types of light bulbs to test and see which worked best.\nThe workload was enormous, and she was exhausted every night.\nBut thanks to her efforts, the lighting setup in the entire exhibition hall was completely transformed.\nDuring the final adjustment phase, Victoria worked at the exhibition hall during the day and holed up in her hotel room at night, drawing design plans and looking for areas to improve.\nWilliam hadn't contacted her in the past few days. While Victoria felt a sense of relief, she also felt a bit lost.\nShe understood that to William, she was just a temporary fling.\nOnce they returned to Silvermist City, everything would go back to the way it was.\nSo, although she felt a bit disappointed that he hadn't contacted her, she wasn't heartbroken.\nVictoria gathered her things and decided to go shopping.\nMost of the exhibition hall's setup was complete, and she wanted to buy some gifts for Wendy, Elara, and Samuel.\nLast time, during the art association incident, Samuel had helped clear her name, and her award was reissued. She had to thank him properly.\nHarborview City's malls were bustling and lively, filled with crowds. Victoria weaved through the shops.\nShe bought some pastries and small accessories first, then went to a skincare store to buy sets for her friends.\nAlthough the prices were high, Victoria gritted her teeth and bought them.\nShe had given most of her savings to Bobby, but she had just received her salary and bonus, which was enough for her expenses.\nPassing by a handmade crafts store, she saw some unique and cute items inside. An idea struck her-maybe she could make a handmade gift for Samuel.\nIt would show her gratitude and sincerity.\nAfter thinking it over, Victoria walked into the store.\nA few hours later, she left with her handmade gift in hand.\nAs she continued shopping, she passed a men's loungewear store. A set of pajamas on a mannequin caught her eye.\nThe pajamas were simple in design, with a slightly open neckline, silver embroidery on the cuffs, and a simple belt, exuding a sense of understated luxury.\nVictoria stared at the pajamas for a long time, a thought suddenly popping into her head.\nWilliam would look really sexy in these.\nA blush crept onto her cheeks, and her heart beat faster.\nAfter a moment of hesitation, she reached into her pocket for her wallet.\n\"Miss, these pajamas are beautiful. Are you buying them for your boyfriend?\" the sales assistant asked enthusiastically.\n\"No,\" Victoria replied, feeling a bit embarrassed.\n\"Don't be shy,\" the sales assistant said with a smile.\nVictoria was about to say something when a familiar, slightly surprised voice called out, \"Ms. Carter?\"\nVictoria looked up to see Lyanna pulling William's sleeve as they walked toward her.\nVictoria's expression instantly became awkward.\n\"What a coincidence! I didn't expect to run into you here,\" Lyanna said with a smile.\nVictoria forced a stiff smile. \"Yeah, what a coincidence.\"\nHarborview City was so big, with so many people, and yet they had to run into each other today.\nWilliam stood next to Lyanna, his gaze sweeping over the shopping bags in Victoria's hand, his eyes flickering slightly.\n\"Ms. Carter, are you buying lingerie?\" Lyanna asked.\nVictoria lowered her eyes and nodded.\n\"I'm planning to buy some too,\" Lyanna said, turning to William and affectionately linking her arm with his. \"William, let's go in and take a look.\"\nWilliam glanced at Victoria a few times, a slight smile playing on his lips. \"Sure.\"\nVictoria's grip tightened on her shopping bags.\nWilliam's \"sure\" carried a lot of weight.\nSeeing her standing still, Lyanna asked, \"Ms. Carter, what's wrong? Aren't you going in?\"\nVictoria quickly replied, \"Yes, I'm going in.\"\nThe three of them walked into the store, and the sales assistant approached them. \"How can I help you?\"\n\"Both this lady and I want to buy some lingerie. Could you recommend something?\" Lyanna said with a smile.\nShe was always proud of her bust size and glanced at Victoria.\nAlthough she was bundled up in winter clothes, making it hard to see their figures, Victoria's slender frame suggested she was probably flat-chested.\nThe sales assistant nodded and asked, \"What size do you usually wear, miss?\"\nLyanna had been waiting for this question. She smiled and replied, \"D cup.\"\nThe sales assistant nodded and went to the counter, bringing out some lingerie for Lyanna, along with a nightgown to wear over it.\nLyanna took the lingerie and threw a flirtatious glance at William. \"William, I'm going to try these on.\"\nVictoria stood nearby, watching the two of them display their intimacy, and couldn't help but roll her eyes.\nLyanna emerged from the fitting room, looking stunning. She had a great figure, with delicate features and a voluptuous chest, and the sexy nightgown only accentuated her beauty.\nWilliam's gaze lingered on her curvaceous figure for just a few seconds before he looked away indifferently.",

        "content": "\"Hey William, how do I look?\" Lyanna twirled around, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.\nShe shot a glance at Victoria, her expression a mix of showing off and challenging.\nWilliam barely looked up, muttering, \"It's fine.\"\nLyanna's face fell slightly, not getting the reaction she wanted. But she quickly masked her disappointment with a sweet smile and turned to Victoria. \"Ms. Carter, why haven't you picked anything yet? Is it too pricey? Don't worry, William's super generous. Since we're here, it's meant to be. He'll cover it for you, right, William?\"\nWilliam glanced at Victoria, a small smile tugging at his lips. \"Sure.\"\nLyanna's smile faltered for a moment, but she quickly recovered. \"See, William's got you covered. What are you waiting for?\"\nVictoria knew that refusing any further would seem awkward. The sales assistant asked for her size, and Victoria, feeling a bit self-conscious, mumbled, \"E cup.\"\n\"Wow, you have a great figure!\" the sales assistant complimented, handing the lingerie to Victoria.\nVictoria took the lingerie, avoiding eye contact, and hurried into the fitting room.\nWilliam watched her retreating figure with a hint of amusement in his eyes.\nLyanna snorted softly upon hearing Victoria's size, not believing her figure could be that good.\nVictoria took her time in the fitting room before finally coming out.\nLyanna was stunned, her face turning sour as a wave of insecurity washed over her.\nVictoria's E cup chest was full and perfectly shaped, her curves alluring and almost flawless.\nWilliam's gaze lingered on Victoria, intense and admiring. \"It looks great on you.\"\nLyanna's face twisted in anger and jealousy.\nWhy? Why did Victoria have to have a better figure and face than her?\nWhile Lyanna went to change, William asked the sales assistant to bring Victoria a few more sets, including some more provocative pieces.\nHe swiped his card, paid for everything, and left an address for the items to be delivered.\nHe leaned close to Victoria's ear and whispered, \"I'll call you tonight.\"\nHis warm breath on her ear made Victoria shiver, her neck flushing red.\n\"No need, I have a dinner with colleagues tonight,\" Victoria stammered.\nWilliam raised an eyebrow, his voice lazy and teasing. \"Cancel it.\"\nVictoria frowned, about to refuse, but Lyanna emerged from the fitting room.\nAs they left the lingerie store, Victoria said goodbye to the two.\nLyanna, not wanting to let her go so easily, smiled brightly at Victoria. \"Ms. Carter, don't leave yet. William is buying me some gifts. You have a good eye for art, help me pick something.\"\nVictoria sighed, \"Sorry, I really have plans today.\"\n\"Please, Ms. Carter, just a little while,\" Lyanna pleaded softly.\nVictoria pressed her lips together and finally nodded, knowing exactly why Lyanna insisted on dragging her along. It was all about showing off how generous William was to her.\nThey arrived at the jewelry counter, and Lyanna pointed to a diamond necklace. \"William, I really like this one. Can you put it on me?\"\n\"Sure,\" William nodded.\nLyanna beamed, clinging to his arm. \"Thank you, William! I knew you were the best!\"\nShe wrapped her arm around William's muscular one, leaning affectionately on his shoulder. William's expression remained unchanged, though a flicker of impatience crossed his eyes as he patted her head.\nLyanna picked out several more pieces of jewelry, and William paid for everything without blinking, the total exceeding a million dollars, drawing the attention of passersby. People wondered which wealthy man was spending so lavishly.\nVictoria sat on a nearby sofa, yawning several times. Growing impatient, she stood up and told them she needed to use the restroom.\nLyanna, still trying on jewelry, waved her off dismissively. \"Go ahead.\"\nAs Victoria exited the restroom, someone suddenly pulled her into the fire escape. She was about to struggle when a familiar scent hit her, and she found herself pressed against a hard, warm chest, strong arms encircling her waist. Her back was against the cold wall, her spine rigid.\n\"What are you doing? Let go of me,\" she panted, fear in her voice.\nWilliam's hand caressed her smooth skin, his breath heavy, eyes dark with desire. He leaned in, licking her earlobe, his voice husky. \"What do you think?\"\nVictoria gasped, trembling as she felt his arousal. \"William, calm down.\"\nWilliam lifted her chin, kissing her deeply, his tongue invading her mouth, tasting her sweetness. Victoria whimpered, unable to resist his dominant advance.\n\"William, stop,\" she protested weakly, her hands pushing against his chest, but he held her tighter. In their struggle, William had hiked up her dress, exposing her long, slender legs. He gripped her waist with one hand, the other cupping her rear, pulling her closer. Their proximity made Victoria's breathing erratic.\n\"William!\" Victoria's eyes widened in fear. What was he doing?\nHe made a shushing gesture, trying to control his desire. \"Be good, don't make a fuss.\"\nHis voice was so rough it seemed to come from deep within, filled with longing. Victoria froze, her cheeks burning, hands clutching his jacket.\nWilliam held her close, his eyes dark with lust. \"Not here,\" Victoria whispered, her voice trembling.\n\"No one's around, it's fine,\" William's voice was even raspier.\nVictoria shook her head, unwilling. This was a public place. What if someone saw them?\n\"I don't want to,\" Victoria bit her lip, pushing against his chest.",

It took everything he had to keep his sanity in check.\n\"Come back to the hotel with me?\" William asked, his voice rough.\nVictoria, despite feeling the same pull, shook her head and bit her lip. \"Your Lyanna is still here,\" she said softly.\nWilliam looked down at her, a smile tugging at his lips. \"Are you jealous?\"\n\"No!\" Victoria denied firmly.\nWilliam's smile widened, a hint of mischief in his eyes. \"Really?\"\nVictoria's body tensed. She knew William's tone was teasing.\nSeeing her stunned silence, William's hand slipped under her shirt, caressing her breast. \"You look way cuter like this than usual.\"\nHis bold move made Victoria feel a wave of heat. She pushed against his chest, embarrassed and annoyed. \"That's enough!\"\nWilliam's hand stilled, and he chuckled softly. \"What kind of reaction is this? Playing hard to get?\"\nVictoria's face turned bright red.\nWilliam's gaze darkened as he looked at her flushed face, feeling a painful tightness in his lower body.\nBut this wasn't the right place.\nHe released Victoria and pulled out a cigarette from his bag, lighting it to ease his discomfort.\nAfter taking a few deep drags, he managed to suppress his desire. \"In a few days, we have a family gathering. I need to pick out gifts for my uncle's kids. Lyanna overheard and insisted on helping me choose.\"\nVictoria stared at him in surprise. Was he explaining himself to her?\nAs they stood in silence, Lyanna's voice called from outside, \"William! Where are you?\"\nWilliam squinted, extinguished his cigarette, and tossed it in the trash. He kissed Victoria on the cheek and left.\nThe door closed behind him.\nVictoria stood there, dazed, for a long time.\nAfter a while, she composed herself, waiting for the heat in her face to subside before opening the door to the fire escape.\nLyanna and William were gone. Victoria grabbed a sandwich at the mall to fill her stomach and decided to head back to the hotel. On second thought, she went back and bought the set of men's pajamas.\nWhen Victoria returned to the hotel, the lingerie William had bought for her had already been delivered to her room.\nSeeing the lace, thongs, and various other items, Victoria's face turned crimson.\nAs she stood there, lost in thought, William swiped his key card and walked in.\nVictoria quickly hid the items under the bed and turned to face him, trying to stay calm. \"How did you get in?\"\nWilliam raised an eyebrow and smiled. \"The first time I brought you here, I had the front desk give me a spare key.\"\nHis words left Victoria speechless. He was so cunning.\nWilliam took off his suit jacket and draped it over a chair. He walked to the bed, picked up a piece of lingerie, and seemed pleased. Then he extended his hand to Victoria. \"Come here.\"\nVictoria bit her lip and slowly moved towards him.\nWilliam handed her the lingerie and said, \"Put it on.\"\nVictoria glanced at the delicate, enticing lingerie in her hand, her face flushing again. \"I'm not used to wearing this.\"\nWilliam scoffed at her hesitation. \"It's not like you have to wear it outside. You'll be taking it off soon anyway. What's there to be shy about?\"\nVictoria remained silent, ultimately unable to resist William's insistence. She went into the bathroom and reluctantly changed into the lingerie.\nWilliam sat on the sofa, legs crossed, watching her with interest.\nVictoria wore a light purple slip dress adorned with rhinestones at the hem. A layer of sheer fabric at the waist hinted at the curves beneath, making her look especially alluring.\nHer skin was smooth and delicate, now tinged with a pink hue, making her appear even more enchanting.\nWilliam's gaze traveled down her body, lingering on her exposed collarbone.\nHer smooth skin, framed by the purple sheer fabric, looked like a poppy flower.\nWilliam suddenly wanted to taste it.\nHe stared at her delicate features for a moment before standing up and walking towards her.\nHe cupped the back of her head and leaned down, gently capturing her soft lips.\nHis lips were cool but carried a burning heat. Victoria's face felt like it was on fire, almost melting.\nHe lightly licked her lower lip, then moved to her neck, nibbling affectionately. A tingling sensation spread through her body, and she dug her nails into her palms to keep from making any noise.\nWilliam's kiss didn't stop. His hand roamed over her skin, causing her to shiver.\nShe couldn't help but moan softly.\nWilliam looked up, his deep eyes darkening. He released her lips and whispered in her ear, \"Baby, let me hear you.\"\nVictoria bit her lip, refusing to make a sound. His breath against her ear sent a shiver through her, and she let out a small whimper.\nWilliam's lips curled into a wicked smile. He suddenly lifted her skirt, his hand exploring upwards, gently kneading her soft breast.\nVictoria was already weak from his teasing, her body limp and unable to resist.\nWilliam felt his blood boiling. He cursed under his breath, lifted Victoria, and laid her on the bed, pressing down on her.\n\"William,\" Victoria panted, calling his name.\nWilliam's eyes flickered. He leaned down and captured her lips again.\nThey kissed passionately, their breathing growing heavier. William urgently tore away her clothes, his hand sliding down to her most intimate area, rubbing it through the thin fabric.\nVictoria's body tensed at his touch, instinctively writhing.\nWilliam's body was on fire. Victoria clung to his neck, her head thrown back to meet his fervor.\nHis kisses grew more intense. Victoria felt like she was suffocating. She gripped the bedsheets, trying to stifle her sounds.\nWilliam noticed her distress and looked up, seeing tears in Victoria's eyes. He immediately asked, \"Victoria, why are you crying?\"",

He gently wiped away the tears at the corner of her eyes with his thumb. \"It's okay, don't be scared,\" he said softly.\nHis voice was low and husky, carrying a seductive charm that was incredibly alluring.\nVictoria's heart raced uncontrollably. William was her Achilles' heel, and she couldn't resist him at all.\nShe closed her eyes tightly, her long eyelashes trembling like butterfly wings.\nWilliam's throat went dry. His kisses trailed down to her soft, firm breasts, and he gently nibbled and sucked on them.\nFinally, he couldn't hold back any longer. With a low growl, he thrust into her, hitting the deepest part.\nThe intense impact made Victoria's whole body stiffen. She clung to William's shoulders, cold sweat breaking out on her forehead.\nFeeling Victoria's tense body in his arms, William lowered his head and whispered in her ear, \"Victoria, open your eyes and look at me.\"\nVictoria opened her misty eyes, meeting William's burning, deep gaze. His eyes reflected her blurred face, making her feel even more captivated, as if she were drowning in them.\nTheir young, healthy bodies intertwined, colliding repeatedly.\nVictoria felt like the world was spinning. The pain in her body gradually faded, replaced by a strange tingling and excitement.\nThey held each other tightly. Victoria felt like she was floating, her soul leaving her body.\nHer mouth was dry, and it seemed like there was less and less oxygen in her chest. Her head felt dizzy and swollen, her body trembling uncontrollably.\nWilliam's movements became rougher. His large hands gripped Victoria's hips as he thrust continuously. Each movement sent shivers through her, her toes curling up.\nWilliam's lips and tongue moved from her nose down to her slender neck, lingering there before continuing downward.\nVictoria was overwhelmed by his intense thrusts, her body weak and helpless, relying on him to endure the passion he brought.\nAfter what felt like an eternity, he finally released. His forehead rested against hers, whispering, \"Victoria, call me honey.\"\nHe loved it when she called him Honey, loved the shy, charming way she said his name, making him want to keep her by his side forever.\nVictoria was too exhausted to resist, weakly calling out, \"Honey!\"\nWilliam's heart fluttered. He flipped her over, pinning her beneath him, once again having her.\nThat night, all the lingerie Victoria had just bought was put to use, leaving her exhausted and asleep.\nWhen she woke up, it was already late morning.\nSunlight streamed into the room, filling it with a warm glow.\nShe moved slightly, feeling sore and weak.\nLifting the blanket, she saw the stained sheets, a wave of shame washing over her.\nWhat had she done last night?\nWilliam emerged from the bathroom, freshly washed. Seeing Victoria still lying in bed, he smirked.\nHe walked over, sat on the edge of the bed, and pinched her cheek playfully. \"What, you don't want to get up?\"\n\"Who doesn't want to get up!\" Victoria glared at him, struggling to sit up.\nWilliam's smile widened. He leaned down and scooped her up in his arms.\nVictoria gasped, wrapping her arms around his neck.\nWilliam's deep, pleasant voice sounded, \"Alright, let's get you cleaned up and then have some breakfast.\"\nHe carried her to the bathroom, squeezed toothpaste onto her brush, and handed her the cup, signaling her to brush her teeth.\nVictoria pursed her lips, taking the toothbrush and starting to brush her teeth.\nHer movements were slow, too tired to stand steadily.\nWilliam supported her, saying, \"Let me help you.\"\nVictoria quickly shook her head. \"No, no, I can do it myself.\"\nThough she had to treat him like her husband for a month, she wasn't used to such intimate contact.\nWilliam didn't insist. He sat on the couch, waiting for Victoria to finish.\nHe propped his head on one hand, his gaze fixed on her profile.\nVictoria was focused on brushing her teeth, her delicate skin tinged with a faint pink.\nHe watched her intently, a gentle look in his eyes.\nAfter breakfast, as they were about to leave, Victoria hesitated before finally deciding to give him the bag of pajamas.\n\"For me?\" William looked at the pajamas in the bag, a smile tugging at his lips.\nVictoria nodded awkwardly. \"I just bought them on a whim. If you don't like them, you can throw them away.\"\nShe wasn't sure if William would wear them, considering he probably had plenty of pajamas at home.\nWilliam opened the bag and took out the pajamas.\nHe unfolded them, glancing at them with a faint smile. \"They look great. I like them a lot. Thanks, babe.\"\nVictoria blushed at his words, quickly gathering her things and running off.\nWilliam stood at the door, watching her retreating figure, a satisfied smile on his face.\nVictoria arrived at the exhibition center. The main setup was already done, so she started adjusting the details.\nAs she worked, her phone rang, displaying an unfamiliar number.\nVictoria answered, \"Hello.\"\nA rich, elegant male voice came through the line. \"It's me, Robert.\"\nRobert? Victoria thought for a moment before remembering. Robert was Elara's son, a lawyer.\nShe responded politely, \"Mr. Davis, what can I do for you?\"\nRobert's tone was serious. \"Victoria, you asked me about the lawyer for your father's case. I've found out. His name is Maximus Tate.\"\nVictoria's heart skipped a beat. \"Really? Thank you so much.\"\nRobert continued, \"I heard from my mom that you're in Harborview City. That lawyer is also in Harborview City. If you have time, you should contact him.\"\n\"Really? Where is he?\" Victoria asked urgently.\nRobert replied, \"Maplewood Avenue. His phone number is...\"\nVictoria quickly jotted it down in her notebook, thanking him repeatedly. \"Mr. Davis, thank you so much. When I get back to Silvermist City, I'll treat you to dinner.\"\nRobert chuckled. \"Don't mention it. I have other matters to attend to, so I'll hang up now.\"\nVictoria ended the call and immediately dialed Maximus's number.\nAfter a few rings, a clear voice answered, \"Hello.\"\n\"Hello, is this Mr. Maximus Tate?\" Victoria asked.",

I have some questions about his case.\"\nMaximus responded with a friendly tone, \"Sure thing. I'll be in the southern part of Harborview City tomorrow. Let's meet at 9 AM.\"\nVictoria was excited. \"Okay, I'll be there on time.\"\nThey agreed on a meeting spot, and Victoria hung up the phone.\nVictoria took a deep breath and asked Alton for some time off. Alton didn't even ask why and granted her request immediately.\nEver since William had seen him dropping Victoria off at the hotel, Alton had been too embarrassed to face her again. However, he had been keeping an eye on her work at the exhibition center.\nKnowing how hard she worked every day, Alton felt a pang of sympathy and agreed without hesitation. If he could, he would rather share some of her burden.\nThe next day, Victoria arrived at the agreed-upon café half an hour early.\nMaximus was already there. In his early forties, he was tall, handsome, and a very charismatic and successful man.\nHe shook hands with Victoria and greeted her, \"I'm Maximus. You must be Ms. Carter? Nice to meet you.\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Tate. It's a pleasure to meet you.\"\nAfter a brief introduction, Victoria got straight to the point. \"Mr. Tate, do you remember my father's case?\"\nMaximus took a sip of his coffee and nodded. \"Of course, I remember it very well.\"\nVictoria asked eagerly, \"Can you tell me more about it?\"\nMaximus sighed softly and began, \"W took on this case because Mr. Carter was internationally renowned as a master architect. But once we started, things felt very...\"\nMaximus chose his words carefully, \"Strange.\"\nVictoria frowned and pressed, \"What exactly seemed strange to you?\"\nMaximus thought for a moment and then explained, \"First, the timing. Why did no one question your father's design when the bridge collapsed ten years ago, but suddenly, after a sports complex collapsed, it all came out? Second, the evidence was weak. Apart from the testimony of the head of the design institute, there was no other documentation or proof.\"\nMaximus furrowed his brow and continued, \"And your father himself was odd. Initially, he was adamant that his design was flawless. But then, out of nowhere, he changed his stance and admitted there were flaws, which led to his conviction.\"\n\"So, there must be underlying reason!\" Victoria exclaimed.\n\"You could say that. But as for who framed him, there's one person who seems suspicious,\" Maximus said.\nVictoria was puzzled. \"Who?\"\n\"The head of the design institute who testified against your father, Lachlan Everest,\" Maximus replied after a moment of thought.\n\"Why would he frame my father?\" Victoria murmured to herself.\nMaximus shook his head. \"We couldn't find out. Maybe only he can explain it.\"\n\"Do you know where he is now?\"\n\"No,\" Maximus admitted. \"Shortly after the case ended, he was transferred out of Silvermist City.\"\nVictoria's spirits sank, and she looked down in disappointment.\n\"Don't lose hope. The truth will come out eventually,\" Maximus reassured her.\nVictoria forced a small smile. \"Thank you for your help.\"\n\"If there's nothing else, I'll be on my way.\"\nAfter leaving the café, Victoria returned to her hotel and sat on her bed, lost in thought.\nHer mind was swirling with thoughts of Alvin's case and Maximus's words.\nWhen William opened the door, he saw Victoria sitting on the bed, looking pale and dazed.\nSeeing her like this, William felt an inexplicable pang of sorrow.\nHe walked over, gently touched her pale face, and asked softly, \"What's on your mind?\"\nVictoria snapped out of her daze and looked up into William's deep, dark eyes, suddenly flustered. \"Why are you here again?\"\nWilliam raised an eyebrow and countered, \"Why shouldn't I be here?\"\nHe sat on the edge of the bed, wrapped an arm around Victoria's slender waist, and pulled her into his embrace, leaning down to gaze into her slightly panicked eyes.\nHis warm breath brushed against Victoria's ear, his deep voice magnetic and alluring. \"Didn't sleep well last night? You look terrible.\"\nVictoria tried to avoid touching his warm chest, scooting away to put some distance between them.\n\"I'm fine.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" William's tone hinted at disbelief.\nVictoria bit her lip and mustered the courage to look into his deep eyes. \"I need to ask you for a favor.\"\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\"My father's case...\"\nBefore Victoria could finish, she felt her body tense as he held her tightly.\nWilliam's voice turned icy. \"What does your father's case have to do with me?\"\nTears welled up in Victoria's eyes as she pleaded, \"William, please help me.\"\nHer tears fell onto William's hand, the heat making him frown.\nHe withdrew his hand and said coolly, \"Your father's case was settled two years ago. The court has already ruled. Even if you come to me, it won't change anything.\"\nVictoria bit her lip harder. \"But I believe he was framed.\"\nWilliam narrowed his eyes and stared at Victoria. \"Framed? By whom?\"\nVictoria met his gaze. \"I don't know how to explain it, but I am certain my father was wronged!\"\nVictoria's firm tone angered William. He stood up abruptly, looking down at her. \"What makes you so sure your father was framed?\"\nVictoria stood up as well, looking up at him defiantly. \"I just know.\"\nShe then recounted everything Maximus had told her, adding, \"I think the design institute head, Lachlan, is the key. If we find him, we can uncover the truth.\"\nWilliam listened quietly, his expression calm.\nHe already knew everything Victoria had said, including who Lachlan was.\nTwo years ago, he had learned from one of his father's former subordinates that the bridge collapse ten years ago, which had killed his parents, was not an accident but a deliberate act.\nHe had been investigating ever since but had found nothing.\nThen, when the sports complex Alvin designed collapsed, Lachlan testified that Alvin's design had a fatal flaw, failing to account for the building's static load, leading to the collapse.\nAlvin had later confessed, admitting his design had serious errors, causing severe consequences.\nWhat was there to argue?\nBut Victoria's mention of Alvin's initial denial and sudden confession caught his attention.\nStill, he couldn't believe Alvin was innocent.\nLooking at the sorrowful, tear-streaked Victoria, William finally agreed to help her find Lachlan.",

        "content": "Victoria was over the moon when she heard that William had agreed. She immediately threw herself into his arms, wrapping her arms around his neck and exclaiming excitedly, \"This is incredible! I didn't think you'd help me! William, thank you, thank you!\"\nWilliam gently patted her back and said calmly, \"Don't worry, I'll have someone look into Lachlan's background.\"\nVictoria nodded eagerly, \"Okay!\"\nShe stood on her tiptoes and planted a kiss on his lips.\nWilliam was stunned for a second, then quickly took control, deepening the kiss until she was breathless and he reluctantly let her go.\nVictoria's cheeks were flushed, and she lowered her head shyly, afraid to look at him, worried he might see through her thoughts.\nWilliam gently stroked her soft, long hair, his voice seductive, \"I haven't had enough today. Are you sure you want to run away?\"\nWith that, he pounced again, pressing Victoria onto the couch, his large hand covering her breast, gently kneading.\n\"Ticklish,\" Victoria squirmed, trying to escape, but her efforts were futile against his strength. A soft moan escaped her lips, making the air around them sizzle.\n\"Be good, I just want to kiss you,\" William murmured, lightly pecking her luscious red lips.\n\"William!\" Victoria's voice changed pitch.\nShe looked down to see William's soft brown hair brushing against her chest. He first sucked hard, then gently licked, teasing her.\nHer nipples, wet with saliva, felt cold in the air, and the rough texture of William's tongue sent shivers down her spine, causing her to release a flood of arousal.\nWilliam finally turned his attention back to Victoria, who now clearly sensed the 'trouble' signal. She tried to roll away.\nWilliam accurately grabbed her ankle, pulling her back into his arms.\nVictoria's arousal left a clear mark on the leather couch as William dragged her.\n\"William!\" Victoria screamed, feeling his fully erect member pressing against her through his suit, soaking the fabric.\n\"Sorry,\" William whispered, kissing her neck gently, \"I lied. I don't just want to kiss you, I want...\"\nWilliam impatiently pulled down his pants, his hard member springing free.\nThe head of his penis, wet and eager, rubbed against Victoria's entrance, teasing but not entering.\nVictoria was so aroused by his actions that she felt like she was about to climax even without him inside.\n\"Why aren't you struggling? Weren't you trying to run just now?\" William teased, kissing her cheek. As soon as she relaxed a bit, he suddenly thrust into her, his skill preventing any pain from registering in her mind.\nHer cry of pain was replaced by pleasure, and William, seemingly annoyed by her earlier attempt to escape, moved with deliberate intensity, his member hitting her sensitive spots, making her unable to speak.\nJust a few thrusts had Victoria's toes curling in pleasure.\n\"Slower, please,\" Victoria gasped, her face flushed. She clung to William's neck, seeking support against his powerful movements.\nWilliam's arm muscles bulged with effort as he held her waist with one hand, the other kneading her breast. The pleasure shot through her nerves, and William bit her earlobe, \"Say my name.\"\n'When does he get so good at this?' Victoria briefly wondered before she was overwhelmed by pleasure.\nWilliam lifted her from the couch, still joined, and carried her to the bed.\nWith each step, his member rubbed inside her, driving her to tears. By the time he laid her on the bed, Victoria was ready to beg for mercy.\nWilliam knelt on the bed, still inside her, and began undressing.\nHe unbuttoned his shirt with one hand, then tossed it aside, leaning over her.\nVictoria's breasts were roughly handled, and she had no time to think of anything else. She only felt his member pushing deeper, expanding inside her, while William's strong arms caged her in, his unique scent enveloping her.\nWilliam was overwhelmed by the tight, slick feel of her, wanting to stay inside her forever.\n\"Say my name,\" he demanded, his voice low and husky.\nVictoria, having lost all dignity, immediately complied, \"William, please, slower.\"\nShe was pinned to the bed by his powerful thrusts, his member repeatedly hitting her sensitive spots, the mix of pain and pleasure overwhelming her.\nWilliam, too, was struggling to hold back, his breathing heavy as he tried to stave off his climax. He pulled out slightly, then thrust back in.\nVictoria arched her back, sobbing uncontrollably.\nToo good.\nShe clung to William's neck, biting down hard. William pulled out, almost clumsily, ejaculating in the air, a thick white line trailing.\n\"Damn it.\"\nWilliam's chest heaved as he lay on Victoria, eyes closed, savoring the afterglow, muttering a curse.\nThey tangled for a long time before William finally let her go, exhausted on the couch.\nWilliam carried her to the shower, then to the bedroom.\nLying on the soft bed, Victoria watched William's broad, muscular back, her mind racing.\nShe slowly crawled closer, her delicate arms wrapping around his shoulders.\nVictoria closed her eyes, pressing her cheek to William's firm chest, listening to his strong heartbeat.\nIn this place far from Alice, she would allow herself to have him for a short while.\nWhen the month ended, she would draw the line with William.\nVictoria rested her hand on William's arm, drifting to sleep, vaguely hearing him say, \"Sleep.\"\nShe fell into a deep, peaceful sleep.\nWith William's promise, Victoria no longer worried about finding Lachlan.\nAs the exhibition date approached, her work became increasingly hectic, and she barely had time to eat, spinning like a top every day.\nWilliam attended a family dinner with Lyanna and Wayne.\nWayne's eldest son, Dorian Scott, was only a few years younger than William, married and managing a branch in the Kalashea Empire. The younger son, Cassius Scott, had just turned 18 and was in his wild phase, frequenting nightclubs and bars.\nWilliam had little interaction with Dorian and Cassius, hardly knowing them.\nLyanna, however, often hung out with them in the Kalashea Empire. Now back home alone, her father asked Wayne to find her a reliable internship.\nWayne entrusted her to William.\nAt the dinner, Wayne, as the host, raised his glass first. Smiling at William, he said, \"William, I heard from your father that you're planning a big move in the new media field in Silvermist City. Do you need my support?\"\nWilliam smiled slightly, clinking glasses with Wayne, \"No need, Uncle Wayne. I want to build my career on my own.\"\nWayne raised an eyebrow, seemingly impressed, \"Good, you're truly the most capable of the Scott family's younger generation!\"\nHe turned to his sons, \"Dorian, Cassius, learn from William and strive to stand on your own soon.\"\nCassius pouted, \"Dad, you favor William. I'm your real son.\"\nWayne pretended to be angry, \"So what? My brother only has him left. Who else should I favor?\"\nCassius immediately quieted down, shrinking back and drinking obediently.\nDorian held back a laugh at Cassius's sulking.\nLyanna, sitting nearby, felt embarrassed by Cassius's behavior and pinched him hard.\nCassius yelped, looking at Lyanna with a pained expression, \"Lyanna, what did I do to deserve this?\"\nLyanna glared at him, \"Keep talking, and I'll cut your tongue out.\"\nCassius quickly covered his mouth, shaking his head to show he wouldn't speak.\nEveryone laughed, the atmosphere warm and friendly.\nEven William, usually serious, couldn't hide his smile.\nJust then, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen.\nIt was a message from Harry: [Mr. Scott, Lachlan is currently in Harborview City, and I discovered that Wayne met with him after returning.]",

        "content": "The text message also included a photo of Lachlan.\nIt was the same guy who was with Wayne when William saw them at the restaurant last time.\nWilliam stared at the photo, his eyes deep and unreadable.\nWhy did Wayne know Lachlan?\nWhy did Wayne meet him right after returning to the country?\nWilliam glanced at Wayne, who was sitting at the head of the table with a kind smile, and suddenly felt a chill down his spine.\nHe clenched his fists, trying to hide the coldness on his face.\nWayne noticed his unusual behavior and frowned in confusion. \"William, is something wrong?\"\nWilliam lifted his gaze slightly and said calmly, \"It's nothing, Uncle Wayne. Just some issues at the company.\"\nWayne, hearing this, showed concern. \"Are you in trouble? If you can't handle it, remember to let me know. We're family, after all. I won't stand by and do nothing.\"\nWilliam forced a slight smile. \"Thanks, Uncle Wayne. I can handle it.\"\nWayne nodded. \"Good, I know you can.\"\nAfter dinner, William took the drunken Lyanna back to her room in the hotel and was about to call Harry to come over.\nJust as he turned to leave, Lyanna suddenly grabbed his arm. \"William, I have a headache.\"\nWilliam stopped, looking at her with clear, cold eyes. \"You're drunk.\"\nHis tone was steady but left no room for argument.\nLyanna felt uneasy but pretended to be nonchalant, mumbling, \"Uncle Wayne said you should take good care of me.\"\nHer voice trailed off, clearly lacking confidence.\nWilliam initially didn't want to continue dealing with her, but hearing her mention Wayne, he suddenly had a change of heart.\n\"You want me to take care of you?\" he asked, his tone calm.\nLyanna, overjoyed, nodded quickly and pulled William towards the bedroom.\nOnce inside, William closed the door behind them.\nVictoria had come to ask William if he had found any information about Lachlan, but she didn't expect to witness such a scene.\nAlthough she knew he had many women around him, seeing it so blatantly in front of her was a first.\nVictoria's heart felt like it was being pricked by needles, a faint pain spreading through her chest.\nShe bit her lip, forcing herself to leave.\nBut she couldn't move her feet. Her legs felt like they were filled with lead, heavy and immovable, and tears began to flow uncontrollably.\nVictoria kept telling herself, \"William and you only had a physical relationship. You shouldn't fall in love with him. Believe in yourself. You're smart and won't be foolish.\"\nHowever, despite her self-reassurance, the tears wouldn't stop, quickly soaking the front of her shirt.\nA passing janitor noticed and called out in surprise, \"Miss, are you okay?\"\nThe silence was broken.\nVictoria hurriedly wiped her tears, nodded at the janitor, and said lightly, \"I'm fine.\"\nAfter that, she turned and quickly left, as if being chased by a wild beast.\nShe had just reached the hotel lobby when she saw Harry coming in through the main entrance.\nSeeing Victoria's tear-streaked face, Harry was momentarily stunned, then quickly approached her with concern. \"Ms. Carter, what happened? Why are you crying? Did someone mess with you?\"\nVictoria wiped her face haphazardly and shook her head. \"I'm fine.\"\nHarry looked at her worriedly. \"Did something happen? If you have any difficulties, just tell me.\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together and shook her head. \"Harry, I'm really fine. I came to ask if Mr. Scott found any information about Lachlan.\"\nHarry was taken aback, not expecting Victoria to be looking for William for this.\nHe hesitated and said, \"There is news, but...\"\nVictoria immediately became anxious, grabbing his arm and looking at him with pleading eyes. \"Harry, please, you have to tell me. I'm begging you.\"\nHarry sighed and decided to tell the truth. \"Lachlan is in Harborview City. He's now the director of the Institute of Architectural Standard Design at Crystalia.\"\nHearing this, Victoria felt like her blood had frozen.\nThe Institute of Architectural Standard Design!\nThat's a national-level design institute.\nLachlan was the director there!\nNo wonder his testimony led the court to determine that Alvin's design was flawed, resulting in his conviction and imprisonment!\nVictoria clenched her fists, the pain in her chest so intense it nearly made her collapse.\nAfter a long while, she managed to regain her composure and hoarsely said to Harry, \"Thank you, Harry. I need to go.\"\nWith that, she turned and quickly left.\nShe needed to calm down and think about what to do next.\nHarry watched her leave, a look of worry flashing across his face. After hesitating for a moment, he took out his phone and called William.\nThe call was quickly answered, and William's deep voice came through.\nHarry lowered his voice and said, \"Mr. Scott, Ms. Carter seems to be in a bad state.\"\nWilliam, holding back Lyanna's wandering hands with one hand and the phone with the other, replied indifferently, \"Oh? What happened?\"\nHarry thought for a moment and said, \"I saw her crying as she left the hotel. She wouldn't say what was wrong. Then she asked me about Lachlan, and since you asked me to look into it for her, I told her.\"\nWilliam's eyes darkened, and he quietly ordered, \"From now on, don't tell her anything without my permission.\"\nAfter hanging up, William glanced at Lyanna, who was still moaning in his arms, feeling a surge of disgust.\nHe let go of her and stood up. \"I have to go. Tonight's over.\"\nLyanna opened her hazy eyes, pitifully tugging at his shirt. \"William, don't go.\"\nShe had taken off her jacket, revealing her sexy lingerie underneath, her ample chest almost spilling out.\nWilliam frowned impatiently. \"Okay. I won't leave if you tell me why you wanted to be my secretary.\"\nLyanna blushed, shyly staring at William's handsome profile. \"Because I like you.\"\nWilliam sneered, his mocking gaze falling on her smooth skin. \"So what? I don't need a secretary, and I certainly don't need a sex partner.\"\n\"Then I'll be your sex partner, William.\"\nShe was flushed, her forehead covered in sweat, her face red.\nShe kept calling William's name, her breathy voice enough to arouse most men.\nLyanna stood on tiptoe, trying to kiss William.\nBut William remained unmoved, turning his head to avoid her kiss, a cold sneer on his lips.\nHe grabbed her delicate chin, leaning in close, his voice filled with danger. \"Tell me, how did you know I didn't have a secretary in Kalashea Empire?\"\nLyanna froze, instinctively avoiding William's gaze.\nShe nervously twisted her skirt, stammering for a while before whispering, \"Uncle Wayne told me.\"",

Or did you tell him where I was?\"\nLyanna looked up at him, biting her lip, and nodded. \"Yeah.\"\nWilliam narrowed his eyes and let out a cold snort. \"What did he ask you?\"\nLyanna hesitated for a long time before lowering her head and slowly saying, \"Not long after I became your secretary, he asked me about the company and...\"\n\"And what else?\"\nLyanna kept her head down, not daring to look at William, and stammered, \"He also asked about Victoria.\"\nWilliam's fists clenched suddenly, his gaze sharp as he glanced at Lyanna. \"What did you say?\"\nLyanna trembled all over, \"I-I said Victoria was just a slut, always trying to seduce you.\"\nAfter she finished speaking, she sneaked a glance at William, only to see his eyes dark, his lips pressed into a thin line, and his demeanor chilling. She quickly shut her mouth, not daring to say another word.\nWilliam suppressed his anger, calmly adjusted his tie, and said indifferently, \"Let's not talk about this for now. From now on, just do your job for me. Remember, if I find out you're reporting to Uncle Wayne behind my back again, you'll face the consequences.\"\nHis tone was extremely calm, but it sent a chill through Lyanna's entire body.\nWith that, William slammed the door and left.\nLyanna stood there in a daze, her eyes gradually filling with tears.\nVictoria returned to the hotel, her mind occupied with thoughts of Lachlan and the image of William being pulled into a room by Lyanna.\nThinking about it, she felt a faint pain in her chest.\nShe sat on the sofa, burying her face in her knees, her eyes stinging, but she forced herself not to cry.\n'You're just a mistress, what right do you have to be jealous?' she thought.This churned in Victoria's mind, growing stronger and stronger.\nShe kept repeating it to herself, warning herself.\nAfter a while, Victoria slowly lifted her head, her eyes red, her expression dazed, like a soulless puppet, staring blankly ahead.\nA crisp knock on the door startled her.\nVictoria quickly adjusted her expression and wiped away her tears.\n\"Who is it?\" she asked, sniffling.\nThe door opened, and William stood there holding two cups of warm cocoa.\nHe handed one to Victoria. \"Drink this.\"\nVictoria stared blankly at the steaming warm cocoa in her hand, her eyes red, her throat choked up.\n\"Why are you here?\" she sniffled, her voice muffled.\nWasn't he supposed to be with Lyanna in the room? How did he have time to come find her?\nWilliam set down the other cup of hot cocoa and approached Victoria, wrapping his arm around her slender shoulders and pulling her into his embrace.\nVictoria's body stiffened, and she immediately began to struggle. \"Don't touch me!\"\nWilliam held her tighter, as if afraid she would escape if he let go.\n\"Stop it, let's talk.\" William's voice was gentle.\n\"There's nothing to talk about between us. Let go of me now!\" Victoria struggled, tears streaming uncontrollably down her face.\n\"Don't move.\" He grabbed her wrist, his warm, broad hand gently patting her slender arm, his magnetic voice filled with a soothing charm.\nVictoria's body went limp, and she stopped resisting.\nWilliam rested Victoria's head on his shoulder, letting her lean against him.\n\"Did you see me go into Lyanna's room earlier?\" he asked softly.\n\"Yeah,\" Victoria replied sullenly.\n\"Nothing happened between us. I'm not interested in her at all. I just had something to ask her. Don't overthink it, okay?\"\nVictoria kept her head down, not responding to his words.\nWhether he was telling the truth or not, what right did she have to question him?\nThey only had a month left on their contract. What right did she have to accuse him?\nSeeing her disbelief, William sighed and tugged at the corner of his mouth. \"Didn't I tell you? I can only get hard for your body!\"\nVictoria's face turned bright red at his blunt words, and she punched him hard. \"You jerk!\"\nWilliam caught her small fist and pressed it against his chest, laughing. \"Don't believe me? Feel for yourself!\"\nThen, he moved her hand down to his lower abdomen.\nVictoria felt his heat and blushed furiously.\nHe was actually hard!\n\"William, you!\" Victoria was both embarrassed and angry, trying to pull her hand back, but William suddenly leaned in and covered her lips with his, kissing her deeply and passionately.\nCaught off guard, Victoria almost suffocated from his kiss, clutching the buttons of his shirt tightly, enduring his wild and domineering kiss.\nAfter a long time, they finally separated, both panting heavily as they stared at each other.\nWilliam's eyes were filled with desire. He licked Victoria's swollen, red lips, his voice hoarse. \"Still doubting me?\"\nVictoria's heart raced, and she swallowed nervously, turning her head away and pretending to be calm. \"No.\"\n\"Good girl.\" William ruffled her hair and brought the hot cocoa to her. \"Open your mouth.\"\nVictoria obediently opened her mouth, letting him feed her a big sip. She couldn't help but frown. \"Where did you get this hot cocoa? It's so sweet it's sickening.\"\nWilliam couldn't help but laugh at her puffed-up cheeks. \"Someone was jealous, so I asked the shop to add extra sugar.\"\nVictoria's cheeks burned, and she quickly changed the subject. \"Thanks for finding out about Lachlan so quickly.\"\nWilliam smiled. \"I've always taken your matters seriously.\"\n\"Thank you. I'll handle the rest myself. No need to trouble you.\"\nHearing this, William's smile faded, and he frowned. \"Don't rush. Let me investigate further. I warn you, don't act on your own.\"\nSeeing his serious expression, Victoria knew this matter wasn't simple.\nBut for Alvin's sake, she didn't want to back down. She forced a smile and said, \"Got it. I won't do anything rash.\"\n\"Good girl.\" William stroked her long hair, satisfied.\nVictoria promised William she wouldn't act rashly, but she was too anxious to just wait around. She couldn't suppress her inner urge.\nEven if she didn't go directly to Lachlan, she had to check out his workplace.\nMaybe she'd get lucky and find some clues.\nFortunately, the Institute of Architectural Standard Design wasn't far from the exhibition center. Taking advantage of her lunch break, she took a cab to the design institute.",

        "content": "The Institute of Architectural Standard Design might not be huge, but it covers a vast area, with towering buildings and renowned designers gathered there.\nVictoria stood at the corner of the bus stop, scanning the area for any sign of Lachlan.\nSuddenly, she heard footsteps passing by her side.\nShe turned her head and was shocked to see Wayne.\nWhat was he doing here?\nCould it be a coincidence?\nVictoria thought she was seeing things and blinked hard, but it was definitely Wayne.\nShe quickly bent down, pretending to tie her shoelaces, and sneaked a glance at Wayne.\nWayne seemed unaware of her presence and walked straight into the building with his assistant.\nVictoria breathed a sigh of relief.\nThe building had security, requiring either a pass or someone inside to let you in. Wayne was clearly let in by someone inside, as a group of people greeted him as soon as he entered.\nFrom her distance, Victoria couldn't make out who was welcoming him.\nShe pretended to be a passerby, sneaking a few glances inside.\nShe thought she was being discreet, but Wayne had already noticed her every move.\nVictoria waited at the entrance for a long time, but Wayne didn't come out. Feeling the urge to use the restroom, she headed to the nearby public bathroom.\nAs she approached, she saw a middle-aged man in shabby clothes anxiously looking around.\nWhen Victoria walked by, the man nervously approached her. \"Miss, can you help me?\"\n\"Help?\" Victoria looked at him, feeling something was off.\nThe man hesitated, then blushed and handed her something. \"Miss, my daughter is in the last stall. She just got her period. Could you please give her this sanitary pad?\"\nHe handed her the pad, smiling awkwardly.\nVictoria was momentarily stunned but then understood. This was a common situation for girls, and she had experienced it herself.\nShe took the pad and smiled at the man. \"Don't worry, I'll take care of it.\"\n\"Thank you so much.\"\n\"No problem.\" Victoria walked into the last stall with the pad.\nAs soon as she opened the door, a spray hit her face, and she lost consciousness.\nWilliam knew Victoria wouldn't just sit around, so he had Harry assign someone to follow her early in the morning.\nWhen he learned she was heading to the Institute of Architectural Standard Design, he suspected trouble and immediately rushed there with Harry.\nThe bodyguard protecting Victoria saw her enter the women's restroom but didn't dare to follow, waiting outside instead.\nUnexpectedly, she didn't come out for a long time, and the middle-aged man who had asked her to deliver the pad was gone.\nThe bodyguard, worried, entered the restroom, only to find it empty.\nPanicked, he called William to report.\nWilliam's face darkened as he ordered the bodyguard to keep searching the area.\nWith a cold, menacing aura, William called for surveillance footage from the area.\nMinutes later, he received a crucial lead. After Victoria entered the restroom, someone left through the back door with a large suitcase and got into a black van.\nThe van's license plate and current location were sent to William, who immediately drove there.\nWhen William and Harry arrived, the van was parked in a remote area, but the occupants were gone.\nHarry, a former special forces member skilled in tracking, examined the surroundings.\nHe quickly found some clues.\nWorried about Victoria's safety, William couldn't wait for backup. After calling for a helicopter, he and Harry headed into the wilderness.\nVictoria slowly regained consciousness, her head throbbing.\nAs she became more aware, she realized she was in a dilapidated house, the air thick with dampness and mold.\nThe place seemed abandoned for a long time, with water stains and moss on the walls and cobwebs in the corners.\nFear gripped her, and she trembled uncontrollably.\nShe struggled against the ropes but couldn't break free.\nVictoria knew fear wouldn't help. She had to stay calm.\nTaking a deep breath, she tried to steady her breathing and began to survey her surroundings for an escape route.\nJust then, her captors entered the room.\nThey wore masks, revealing only their cold, menacing eyes, staring at Victoria like she was prey.\nOne of them approached, grabbed her hair, and yanked her head up. \"What were you doing at the Institute of Architectural Standard Design?\"\nVictoria winced in pain but held her ground. \"I don't know what you're talking about!\"\n\"Don't play dumb! You better start talking!\" The man slapped her hard, making her head spin.\n\"Last chance. Tell me why you were at the Institute of Architectural Standard Design, or else!\"\nVictoria bit her lip, knowing she had to say something.\n\"I was looking for Lachlan. I wanted to ask him about my dad's design plans from years ago.\"\nThe man frowned, thinking it over, then pressed her again. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, absolutely.\"\nThe man scrutinized her, seeing sincerity in her eyes, and believed her somewhat.\nHe asked, \"How did you find Lachlan?\"\nVictoria didn't want to involve Maximus or William.\nHer instincts told her these people would harm William.\nShe shook her head, trying to stay calm. \"I was looking for inspiration online and found out Lachlan is now the director at the Institute of Architectural Standard Design, so I went to see him.\"\nHer explanation seemed plausible, and the man believed most of it.\nHe then asked, \"One last question. What does William, the man keeping you, know?\"",

        "content": "Victoria froze for a moment when she heard the words, then quickly lowered her head to hide the shock in her eyes.\nThis guy actually knew William! And he knew she was William's mistress.\nDespite her surprise, Victoria kept a calm front and said, \"I haven't told him anything. He hates my dad. If I even mention him, he loses it, so I don't dare.\"\nThe man scoffed, clearly not buying Victoria's story.\nHe stood up and signaled to the other two men in the room.\nOne of them left and came back with a big basin of water, placing it in front of Victoria.\n\"What are you gonna do?\" Victoria shouted, panic in her voice.\nThe man didn't waste any time. He shoved Victoria's head into the basin, holding her down despite her frantic struggles.\nVictoria choked on the water, her throat burning with pain.\nShe fought desperately, her hands flailing against the water's surface. Just as she felt she was about to suffocate, the man yanked her out of the water.\nVictoria's face was flushed red, her mouth filled with water, her throat in agony, unable to even cough.\nThe man disdainfully tossed the basin aside and lit a cigarette. \"I'm warning you one more time. If you try any tricks, I have plenty of ways to make you suffer.\"\nVictoria clutched her throat, gasping for air.\nThe man took a drag from his cigarette, exhaling a thick cloud of smoke, and said slowly, \"I'll ask you again. What does William know? If you don't tell the truth, I'll rape and kill you.\"\nVictoria's body trembled involuntarily at his words. She looked at the man with tear-filled eyes, her lips quivering as she said, \"He really doesn't know anything. He just uses me for his pleasure. The one he loves is Alice. He doesn't care about me at all.\"\nAt the mention of Alice, the man's eyes flickered briefly but quickly returned to normal.\nHe glanced at his watch, not wanting to waste any more time with Victoria, and ordered the others, \"Take her outside.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nTwo men responded and grabbed Victoria, dragging her out.\n\"What are you gonna do?\" Victoria screamed in terror.\nThe man ignored her and left the small house.\nOutside, there was a barren field with a large pit already dug in one corner.\n\"Bury her!\"\nWith that, the man turned and left. The remaining two men immediately taped Victoria's mouth shut and dragged her to the pit. No matter how much she struggled, they pushed her into the pit.\nVictoria watched as the dirt slowly swallowed her. She thrashed wildly.\nBut it was no use.\nThe dirt piled higher, and her movements grew weaker.\nVictoria felt her body grow cold, her breathing labored, as despair and fear consumed her.\n'No, save me! Help!' she could only whimper through the tape over her mouth.\nThe dirt covered her chest, her nose, and ears, making it hard to breathe.\nVictoria's pupils dilated, her eyes bloodshot, tears streaming down her cheeks as she closed her eyes in despair.\nThe men finished filling the pit and were about to tamp down the dirt when a lookout called through the walkie-talkie, \"Hurry, someone's coming.\"\nHearing this, the leader stopped and ordered, \"Let's go. We can't get caught.\"\nThe others quickly left, and the leader disappeared into the night with an iron rod.\nJust as they left, William and Harry followed the trail to the house.\nHarry saw the door ajar and kicked it open.\nThe house was small, and they quickly searched it, finding no one.\nIn the middle of the room was a basin and some water stains, evidence that someone had been there recently.\nWilliam squinted, a bad feeling gnawing at him.\nHe clenched his fists, trying to control his anxiety, and ordered Harry, \"Send out a search party. We must find her today!\"\nHarry nodded and rushed out.\nWilliam was about to leave when he noticed a splash of red in the corner, his pupils contracting.\nHe walked over and stared at the vivid red stain.\nIt was blood!\nHe ran to the spot, shouting, \"Harry, come back!\"\nHarry had just stepped outside when he heard William's shout and quickly returned.\nWilliam looked at the freshly dug earth, his eyes wide with rage.\nA voice in his head told him-Victoria was buried there.\nHe couldn't wait for tools and began digging with his bare hands.\nSweat beaded on William's forehead from worry, his fingers bleeding as he dug, but he didn't care, continuing to dig frantically.\nHarry, seeing William's desperation, was terrified and tried to stop him. \"Mr. Scott, calm down.\"\nWilliam pushed Harry away, continuing to dig, muttering, \"Victoria, wait for me. I'll find you.\"\nHarry had no choice but to help dig.\nWilliam's well-manicured fingers were torn and bloody, but he seemed oblivious to the pain, relentlessly digging.\nFinally, their combined efforts revealed a strand of hair.\nWilliam was overjoyed, clearing the dirt to uncover Victoria's body.\nVictoria lay in the filthy dirt, her clothes disheveled, her hair a mess, her lips pale, and she wasn't breathing.\n\"Victoria.\" William felt his mind go blank, then vomited a mouthful of blood.\nHe reached out, trembling, to touch Victoria's cold, pale face, murmuring, \"Victoria, wake up.\"\nHe knelt, holding Victoria's body, sobbing like a child.\nHarry, unable to bear William's pain, shouted, \"Mr. Scott, she's still warm. Try CPR!\"\n\"Yes, CPR.\" William clung to this last hope and immediately began.\nWilliam knelt over Victoria, performing CPR, his eyes red, tears streaming down his face, dripping into the dirt.\nSuddenly, a violent cough erupted, and Victoria spewed out a mouthful of filth.",

        "content": "William ignored the foul smell and quickly stood up to help Victoria lie down on the ground, administering CPR.\nVictoria's eyes fluttered open, her vision blurry. She struggled to speak, using all her strength to call out, \"William.\"\nHer voice was faint and unclear. William leaned closer to her, softly reassuring, \"Don't worry, I'm right here, Victoria.\"\nVictoria's panic subsided as she took in William's strikingly handsome features, and tears streamed down her face. \"William, I thought I'd never see you again.\"\nWilliam wiped away her tears and kissed the corner of her eyes, his voice hoarse, \"Shh, it's okay. You're safe now.\"\nAt that moment, the sound of a helicopter's rotors filled the air.\nWilliam looked up to see the helicopter landing in a nearby clearing.\nHe lifted Victoria in his arms and walked towards the helicopter.\nAfter about a half-hour flight, they finally arrived at the hospital. The doctors examined Victoria and found that aside from being severely frightened and having a minor lung infection from nearly drowning, she was otherwise unharmed.\nThe doctor instructed the nurse to take Victoria to a room to rest.\nWilliam stayed by her side, watching her pale face as she slept, his heart aching.\nHe gently brushed his hand over Victoria's brow, his voice filled with fear, \"Victoria, thank goodness you're okay. What would I have done if something happened to you?\"\nHarry approached, ready to report his findings.\nWilliam stopped him and led him into the hallway, asking, \"What did you find out?\"\nHarry frowned, his expression serious and uneasy. \"The car's license plate was fake, and the people who kidnapped Ms. Carter have all disappeared.\"\nHearing this, William clenched his fists, his knuckles turning white. He growled through gritted teeth, \"Useless!\"\nHarry remained silent, accepting the reprimand.\nAs the head of security, it was his failure to prevent Victoria's kidnapping, and he hadn't found any leads. William's anger was justified.\n\"Mr. Scott, I'm sorry.\"\nWilliam's face was dark, his anger barely contained. \"Forget it, it's not your fault. If it was his doing, it's normal you couldn't find any clues.\"\nHarry felt even more guilty hearing this. \"Mr. Scott, I failed in my duty. I'm willing to accept any punishment!\"\nWilliam sighed and shook his head. \"It's not your fault. This was my oversight.\"\nWilliam knew it wasn't Harry's fault. The perpetrator had planned this meticulously, leaving no trace. But he hadn't expected Victoria to be harmed.\n\"Now, find out where Lachlan is. If possible, 'invite' him over!\" William's tone was chilling.\nHarry nodded and left.\nMeanwhile, at The Scott Manor, Wayne slapped Dorian hard across the face. \"Idiot! You're getting dumber by the day! How did I end up with such a foolish son? You can't even handle a simple task!\"\nDorian clutched his swollen cheek, lowering his eyes to hide his resentment and hatred. \"Father, believe me, I didn't think she could survive that. She got lucky this time, but next time...\"\nWayne wasn't having it. His anger flared, and he kicked Dorian's knee. \"Next time? Do you think William is as stupid as you?\"\nHe kicked Dorian again, harder this time.\nDorian grunted in pain, falling to one knee. He bit his lip, enduring the pain without making a sound.\nWayne, shaking with rage, grabbed a golf club and struck Dorian's back. \"You useless fool! If William finds out, I'll kill you myself!\"\nDorian pressed his lips together, enduring the blows.\n\"Father,\" Dorian called weakly, \"he won't find out. I was very discreet.\"\nWayne, panting, put down the club and sat, drinking some tea to calm his anger. \"What about Lachlan? How did you handle him?\"\n\"I've sent him abroad. We have his daughter; he won't talk,\" Dorian replied respectfully.\n\"If killing him wasn't so obvious, I'd have done it already. Keeping him is a risk,\" Wayne's eyes gleamed with malice.\n\"Don't worry, Father. I'll have him watched around the clock. He won't ruin our plans,\" Dorian said quietly.\nWayne waved him off, and Dorian left the room.\nThe next day, Victoria woke up to a dimly lit room, the curtains drawn.\nShe slowly sat up, rubbing her aching head. The nightmare of the previous day still haunted her, making it hard to breathe.\n\"Victoria, are you okay?\" William opened the curtains, letting warm sunlight flood the room, dispelling the darkness and making Victoria feel much better.\nVictoria turned to William, smiling. \"I feel a lot better.\"\nWilliam noticed she still looked pale but seemed more spirited.\nHe sighed in relief, smiling at her. \"Hungry?\"\nVictoria nodded. \"I'm starving.\"\nWilliam chuckled and brought over a tray of food.\nThe meal was simple: a bowl of oatmeal, a vegetable salad, and some fried shrimp. The fresh ingredients made it look appetizing.\nVictoria couldn't help but swallow, taking a spoonful of oatmeal. It was soft and flavorful, soothing her taste buds.\nEven her fears and pain seemed to fade.\n\"This is delicious,\" Victoria praised.\n\"Eat as much as you like,\" William said with a smile.\nWatching her eat heartily, William felt a warm, comforting sensation in his chest.\nAfter eating, Victoria finally had the strength to ask about the previous day's events. \"Did they catch the people who kidnapped me?\"\nWilliam's handsome face darkened, his tone cold. \"No.\"\nVictoria was stunned, then frowned. \"Do you know who did it?\"\n\"I have a good idea, but no proof,\" William replied, his eyes narrowing with complex emotions.\nVictoria paused, then asked, \"What about Lachlan? I think he's involved.\"",

        "content": "\"He got away!\" William growled, clenching his teeth. \"The people I sent to find him came up empty. He vanished without a trace. I bet he skipped the country!\"\nVictoria's face went pale as she listened, her voice shaking. \"It's all my fault. I should've listened to you. I shouldn't have gone looking for clues on my own. I ended up tipping him off.\"\nBy the end, Victoria's eyes were red, tears welling up.\nVictoria was filled with self-loathing. Just when they had found a lead to clear Alvin's name, she ruined it due to her foolishness!\nWilliam's heart ached. He quickly tried to comfort her. \"Don't beat yourself up. I promise I'll find the evidence to clear your father's name.\"\nThis was not just for Alvin, but also to uncover the truth about his own parents' deaths!\nVictoria sniffled, trying to hold back her tears. \"William, thank you for saving me and for helping me.\"\nHer expression was one of sorrow and despair.\nWilliam gently patted her shoulder, speaking softly. \"Don't cry. Focus on getting better first.\"\n\"I feel fine,\" Victoria insisted. \"I was just a bit shaken up. I want to be discharged this afternoon.\"\nWilliam frowned, worried. \"That's not a good idea. You've been through a lot. You should stay in the hospital for a few days.\"\nVictoria was stubborn. \"I'm really okay.\"\nWith the exhibition coming up, she didn't want her condition to delay their work.\nSeeing her determination, William had no choice but to relent.\nThanks to Victoria's meticulous planning, the home design exhibition went off without a hitch and received rave reviews.\nVictoria's work in Harborview City was done, but William needed to stay a couple more days to handle some Scott family matters. Victoria had planned to wait for him so they could return to Silvermist City together.\nUnexpectedly, she received a call from Ryan.\nRyan's voice sounded anxious. \"Victoria, where are you right now?\"\nVictoria was taken aback. \"I'm on a business trip in Harborview City. What's wrong?\"\nRyan angrily replied, \"Samuel's been in an accident and is in the hospital. Come see him right away.\"\nVictoria's heart skipped a beat, her mind going blank. \"How is he?\"\n\"He was in a car accident. He's in critical condition at Dawn Healthcare Center,\" Ryan's voice was hoarse.\nVictoria immediately stood up. \"Okay, I'll book a flight and come right away!\"\nShe hurriedly bought the earliest flight to Silvermist City.\nVictoria arrived in Silvermist City at 8 PM. She quickly hailed a cab to Dawn Healthcare Center.\nWhen she reached the hospital room, Ryan was by Samuel's bedside.\nSeeing her, Ryan looked relieved and grabbed her arm. \"You're finally here!\"\nVictoria anxiously looked at Samuel lying in bed. \"What happened? How did he get into an accident?\"\nRyan sighed. \"It's because of you! Ever since he got back from the Arctic and heard you and William were in Harborview City, he's been out of sorts. I'm really at a loss with him. He's thirty years old but acts like a kid when it comes to you.\"\nVictoria bit her lip, feeling guilty. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\"Alright,\" Ryan said, patting her shoulder in an attempt to comfort her. \"Don't blame yourself. He's not dead, just has a broken leg.\"\nHearing this, Victoria let out a sigh of relief, her heart finally settling.\nShe turned to look at Samuel. His eyes were closed, his face pale, and his forehead wrapped in thick bandages.\nHis handsome face was covered in scratches, and his lips were bruised, making him look pitiful.\nSeeing Victoria's worried expression, Ryan sighed. \"Victoria, you need to think carefully. Who's better for you? William, who keeps hurting you and flirting with others, or Samuel, who's mature and devoted to you?\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes.\nShe knew the difference between William and Samuel.\nNo matter how sweet things were with William in Harborview City, once they returned to Silvermist City, William would go back to Alice.\nShe was just a thief, stealing a few days of happiness.\nThinking of this, Victoria softly said, \"Thank you. I'll think about it. I have a few days off. I'll stay and take care of him.\"\n\"Good,\" Ryan nodded. \"He'll be happy to see you. Take care of him for now.\"\nWith that, he left the room, giving Victoria and Samuel some space.\nVictoria walked to Samuel's side and sat down. She gently touched his forehead, whispering, \"Samuel.\"\nFeeling the heat from his forehead, Victoria was startled. He had a fever!\nShe quickly called for a doctor to check his temperature and start an IV.\nAfter everything was settled, Victoria leaned back in the chair by the bed, closing her eyes in exhaustion.\nSo much had happened recently. She needed rest.\nAs she was drifting off, she faintly heard Samuel's weak voice: \"Victoria, don't leave me. Don't go.\"\nShe opened her eyes and looked at the bed.\nIn the dim light, Samuel's face looked even paler. He was clutching the blanket, his expression pained, his brows furrowed.\nSeeing him like this, Victoria felt her heart ached.\nShe held his hand, gently stroking it. \"Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere. I'll stay with you.\"\nSamuel seemed to hear her; he calmed down and gradually fell asleep.\nVictoria sighed softly, leaning against the bed, slowly closing her eyes.\nThe next morning, Victoria felt someone touching her forehead.\n\"Are you awake?\" Samuel's voice was deep and soothing.\nVictoria opened her eyes to see Samuel gazing at her, his eyes filled with deep affection.\n\"Are you feeling better?\"\nSeeing Samuel's bandaged ankle, Victoria looked down, feeling guilty, unable to meet his gaze.\nSamuel smiled and gently ruffled her hair. \"Silly, I'm fine. But why did you come?\"\nVictoria bit her lip. \"Ryan called me yesterday and told me about your accident. I was so scared. How could I not come?\"\nHer eyes reddened, tears threatening to fall.\n\"Ryan always talks too much. Don't take it to heart,\" Samuel comforted her.\n\"No...\" Victoria started to say, but her phone rang, interrupting her.",

        "content": "Victoria pulled out her phone. It was William calling. She hesitated for a moment, gave Samuel an apologetic smile, and stepped into the hallway before answering.\nAs soon as the call connected, William's voice, cold and furious, erupted from the other end. \"Victoria, where the hell did you go? Why didn't you come back to the hotel last night?\"\nVictoria was taken aback but quickly composed herself. \"Sorry, something urgent came up. I had to get back to Silvermist City.\"\nWilliam struggled to contain his anger. \"What was so urgent?\"\nVictoria hesitated. She wasn't sure how to explain to William that she had come back to Silvermist City for Samuel.\nWilliam's patience wore thin. \"Victoria!\"\nHearing the change in his tone, Victoria quickly replied, \"A friend of mine was in a car accident. I came to Silvermist City to visit them.\"\n\"Your friend?\" William scoffed. \"Wendy? Or is it that Samuel guy?\"\nVictoria's heart skipped a beat. \"How did you know?\"\nOn the other end, William's voice dripped with sarcasm. \"Victoria, you're something else. One minute you're all lovey-dovey with me in Harborview City, and the next, you can't wait to run back to Silvermist City to throw yourself at another man!\"\nVictoria, who had felt a twinge of guilt, now felt her eyes sting with unshed tears as she listened to his accusations.\nShe fought to keep her voice steady. \"William, our one-month agreement is almost up. I don't need to report my every move to you, do I? Don't forget, your fiancée Alice is still waiting for you in Silvermist City.\"\nWilliam's eyes narrowed at the mention of Alice. \"What do you mean? Are you saying that as soon as you return to Silvermist City, you're done with me?\"\nVictoria took a deep breath, holding back her tears. \"Yes. After all, she's your fiancée, the one you love the most. I have no reason to keep holding onto you. Do you expect me to remain the hidden lover forever?\"\n\"Don't you dare!\" William's voice was filled with rage. \"Victoria, I'm warning you, don't push my limits.\"\n\"Am I pushing your limits, or are you pushing mine? William, tell me, who do you choose: Alice or me?\" Victoria's voice was firm, unyielding.\nShe knew asking this was setting herself up for heartbreak, but she had no choice. She needed to break free from this situation.\nShe couldn't continue being just a mistress.\nWilliam's lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes dark and unreadable.\nAfter a long pause, he finally spoke. \"You know, between you and her, there's only ever been one choice.\"\nHearing this, the last bit of hope in Victoria's heart vanished.\nOf course, no matter how much they acted like a normal couple in Harborview City, it was all an illusion.\nHow could she expect William to give up Alice for her?\nAlice, the one he had once fled a wedding for, the one he cherished above all.\nVictoria took a deep breath, calming herself. \"I understand. In that case, I wish you and Alice all the happiness.\"\nJust as she was about to hang up, William's voice came through urgently. \"Victoria, what if I said that even if I marry her, I'd still take care of you? Would you believe me?\"\nVictoria was momentarily stunned, then let out a bitter laugh. \"William, don't you think that's ridiculous? Are you asking me to stay your secret mistress forever? What do you take me for?\"\nHer voice was filled with anger, but more than that, it was filled with sorrow.\n\"No, you misunderstand.\" William's voice was desperate. \"I mean...\"\n\"William, is there anything else? If not, I'm hanging up.\"\n\"Wait.\" William's voice softened. \"Victoria, let's talk when I get back...\"\n\"William, I'm exhausted. I'm really tired.\" Victoria's voice broke. \"Since you've chosen Alice, please, don't disturb me anymore. I've decided to be with Samuel.\"\nVictoria said everything she needed to in one breath.\n\"Don't you dare!\"\nBefore William could finish, the call was disconnected.\nWilliam stared at the phone in his hand, his face growing darker by the second, his eyes filled with a storm of emotions.\nHe threw the phone against the wall, shattering it, his teeth clenched in fury.\nVictoria wiped away her tears, composed herself, and walked back into Samuel's hospital room.\nSamuel saw her red eyes and immediately knew who had upset her. He felt a pang of helplessness but managed a gentle smile.\n\"Victoria, come sit and rest for a bit.\"\nVictoria nodded, sitting down beside him and forcing a smile. \"Sorry, Samuel, for making a fool of myself in front of you.\"\nShe lowered her head, trying to hide her vulnerability.\n\"Don't say that. I'm more worried about you than anything else.\" Samuel patted her hand gently, comforting her.\n\"Thank you, Samuel.\"\nSamuel shook his head and reached out to smooth her hair.\n\"Samuel, I made you something. I hope you don't mind.\" Victoria suddenly remembered the gift she had made for him at the craft store. She quickly retrieved it from her bag and handed it to him.\nSamuel's eyes lit up with surprise. He hadn't expected her to get him a gift.\n\"Thank you, Victoria.\" Samuel opened the box.\nInside was a wooden palette with his name carved into it.\n\"You made this yourself?\" Samuel's eyes sparkled with joy as he held the palette.\nVictoria nodded, a bit embarrassed. \"After the art competition, you helped clear my name. I didn't know how to thank you, so I made you a gift. I hope you don't mind.\"\nIt was her first attempt, so it wasn't perfect, and the colors were plain. But it was heartfelt.\n\"I love it! I really do!\" Samuel looked at her, his eyes filled with warmth.\nVictoria sighed in relief. \"I'm glad you like it.\"\nAs they chatted, a nurse came in to change Samuel's bandages.\nNot wanting Victoria to see his wounds, Samuel looked at her awkwardly. \"Victoria, you must be hungry. Why don't you go get something to eat?\"\nVictoria suddenly remembered that neither of them had eaten breakfast. She felt a bit guilty. \"I'll go get us some breakfast. There's a new restaurant nearby that has great food.\"\n\"Thank you, Victoria.\"\nAfter Victoria left, the smile on Samuel's face disappeared completely.",

        "content": "Over the next few days, Victoria stayed at the hospital to take care of Samuel. She brought him tea, fetched his medication, and generally acted like a dedicated caregiver.\nThe only thing she felt too embarrassed to help with was assisting Samuel to the bathroom, so she left that to the hospital staff.\nWhen they had free time, Victoria and Samuel would each take a sketchbook and draw together.\nSamuel would give Victoria tips on her technique, and she listened intently, always eager to learn. These peaceful days brought her immense joy.\nVictoria even started to think that life should be this simple and pure.\nBut then her vacation ended, and she had to return to work.\nShe patiently explained everything to the caregiver who would be taking over.\nSamuel watched her quietly as she went over the details with the caregiver.\nWhen she finished, he asked the caregiver to leave before speaking to Victoria. \"Victoria, you don't need to worry about me. Just take care of yourself.\"\nVictoria nodded. \"You focus on getting better. I'll come visit whenever I can.\"\n\"Victoria.\" Samuel grabbed her arm, looking at her intently. \"I...\"\nVictoria's heart skipped a beat. She quickly pulled her hand back and changed the subject. \"I need to go pack. I have work tomorrow.\"\nSamuel gave a bitter smile. \"Don't be scared. I just have some good news for you.\"\nVictoria looked puzzled. \"What good news?\"\nSamuel lowered his gaze and said softly, \"You've been upset about dropping out of college, right? Because you won the gold medal at the art association last time, I applied for you to take the entrance exam at the University of Aesthetics Shine. If you pass, you'll be a full-fledged student there.\"\nVictoria was stunned. She could hardly believe her ears. \"Samuel, is this for real?\"\nSamuel smiled faintly and held her hand. \"Have I ever lied to you?\"\nVictoria shook her head vigorously. \"No!\"\nThen she seemed to remember something. \"But what about my job at Starry Studio Gallery?\"\n\"Don't worry. This entrance exam is for outstanding talents in the community. You just need to take online courses, attend a few mandatory classes on weekends, and pass the exams at the end of the term.\"\nVictoria hugged Samuel tightly, her eyes brimming with excitement. \"That's amazing! Thank you, Samuel!\"\n\"You're silly.\" Samuel ruffled her hair. \"You don't need to thank me. I just want you to be happy.\"\nVictoria stared at Samuel.\nHis handsome face was filled with deep care and affection.\nFrom the beginning, he had always been there for her, looking out for her, thinking of everything.\nAnd she had been wasting her time being sad over William, who never loved her and always mistreated her.\nThinking of this, her eyes reddened, and she felt a sharp pang in her nose. She couldn't help but throw herself into Samuel's arms.\n\"Samuel, why are you so good to me?\"\nFeeling the wetness on his chest, Samuel stiffened, then gently patted her back to comfort her. \"Don't cry. I hate seeing you cry.\"\nVictoria sniffled, as if making a firm decision. She looked up, trying to hold back her tears. \"Samuel, let's be together.\"\nSamuel's eyes widened in disbelief.\nHis deep voice broke the silence. \"Victoria, did you just say...\"\nVictoria bit her lip and nodded firmly. \"Yeah, I want to be with you.\"\nSamuel was taken aback for a moment, then he responded with a bitter smile. \"You don't have to be with me just because you feel grateful.\"\nVictoria looked at him steadily and shook her head. \"I'm not forcing myself. Besides my dad, you're the only one who truly cares about me and looks out for me.\"\nShe paused, her voice a bit hoarse. \"You know I once sold myself for money, but you never judged me. You stood by me when I needed help the most. Samuel, if I miss out on you, I'll regret it.\"\nSamuel's eyes darkened as he gazed into Victoria's eyes, remaining silent for a long time.\nFor a moment, his heart raced inexplicably.\nHe knew that the connection between Victoria and William wouldn't be easily severed.\nBut right now, he wanted to take a chance, even if the outcome wasn't what he hoped for.\nHe slowly pulled Victoria into his arms, his deep voice gentle. \"Alright, let's give it a try. If you find that you still don't like me, you can leave anytime, and I won't stop you.\"\n\"Okay.\" Victoria nestled obediently in his arms.\nThey held each other in silence, neither saying a word.\nAfter a while, Victoria was the first to let go. \"I have to go. You get some rest.\"\n\"Alright, take care.\"\nLyanna glanced at William, who was sitting in first class with a dark expression, and cautiously asked Harry, who was sitting next to her, \"Harry, what's wrong with William? He looks really upset.\"\nHarry looked at William's grim face.\nOf course, he knew what was going on.\nHis \"kitten\" had run off to \"someone else's house\", and it had infuriated him.\nBut Harry wasn't about to tell Lyanna that! \"Probably some tough issues at the company. Don't ask too much.\"\nLyanna nodded and didn't dare ask more.\nEver since William had confronted her in her room last time, she had been too scared to get close to him.\nThe plane landed smoothly at Silvermist City International Airport.\nWilliam disembarked with a scowl on his face.\nHe walked out of the airport with a cold expression, not letting Harry follow him. He simply ordered, \"Find out what she's been up to since she got back!\"\nThe \"she\" he referred to was none other than Victoria.\nHarry sighed and nodded respectfully. \"Yes, Mr. Scott.\"\nThen he got into another car.\nSeeing William about to leave, Lyanna hurried after him, asking tentatively, \"William, will you take me home?\"\nWilliam ignored her, flooring the gas pedal.\nThe black Maybach roared away like a gust of wind.\nLyanna was left standing awkwardly in the cold wind.\nShe bit her lip, her eyes red as she watched the car speed away.\nBefore William's car even reached Victoria's building, Harry had already gathered the information.\nIn Silvermist City, where he worked in the media industry, information was easy to come by.\nTracking Victoria's movements was a piece of cake.\nHe found out everything, including how Victoria had been diligently taking care of Samuel in the hospital and even the hug they shared in the hospital room.",

She pulled it out and saw an anonymous email.\nHer brow furrowed slightly, a sense of unease washing over her.\nShe opened the email and saw an attached video file. After a moment of hesitation, she clicked on it.\nThe video sent a chill down her spine.\nIn the footage, Lyanna was dragging a suitcase, clearly just off a plane.\nSuddenly, an angry mob surrounded her, shouting insults and accusing her of being a homewrecker.\nLyanna's face went pale as she tried to explain, her voice trembling and urgent, \"No, it's not like that, you've got it all wrong.\"\nBut the furious crowd didn't give her a chance to explain.\nLyanna looked around desperately, searching for an escape, but all she heard were more accusations and insults.\nSomeone reached out and shoved her hard. Lyanna stumbled, nearly falling.\nShe struggled to keep her balance, but more hands reached out, pushing her.\n\"Listen to me, I really didn't...\" Lyanna tried to defend herself again, but before she could finish, a slap landed hard on her face.\nThe crowd's insults grew louder, and someone started tearing at her clothes.\nLyanna screamed, trying to shield herself with her arms, but she was overpowered.\nHer coat was ripped open, and her shirt was torn.\n\"Stop! Please stop!\" Lyanna fell to her knees, trying to cover herself with her hands.\nVictoria watched the video, feeling a cold chill run through her body.\nShe stared at the screen, horrified by the violence inflicted on Lyanna.\nShe knew that with Lyanna's background, there was no way she would be someone's mistress.\nThis had to be a setup.\nAnd there was only one person crazy enough to do something like this.\nBut who sent her this email?\nShe tried replying: [Who are you?]\nThe response came quickly: [Guess.]\nVictoria: [Ella?]\nElla: [You're smart!]\nVictoria frowned and replied: [Why did you send this to me?]\nElla: [Wanted to see you scared. How does it feel? Exciting?]\nVictoria clenched her fists. [What do you want?]\nElla: [I sent the video, but I didn't do this. You should know who did, right?]\nVictoria: [Besides your sister Alice, I can't think of anyone else.]\nElla: [Exactly. I just wanted to show you what that lunatic Alice is capable of. Lyanna was just William's secretary for a few days, but you're different. Be careful.]\nWith that, Ella closed the email, leaving Victoria with no further response.\nVictoria knew Ella wasn't warning her out of kindness. She just wanted to stir up trouble between her and Alice, hoping to benefit from the chaos. But Victoria wasn't foolish enough to charge ahead because of this threat. Alice had become dangerously unhinged. And now that Victoria had decided to be with Samuel, she didn't want to get involved in the mess between Alice, Ella, and William.\nTaking a deep breath, Victoria headed home. As soon as she opened the door, she sensed something was off. She turned to run, but a powerful force slammed into her, pinning her against the door. A distinct male scent filled her nostrils, and she looked up to see William towering over her. A strong, oppressive aura emanated from him.\nShe looked up, meeting William's icy gaze. William stood in the doorway, one hand pinning Victoria against the door, the other holding a cigarette, its tip glowing in the dim light. He wore a light brown sweater, his expression as cold as a winter frost.\nHe spoke with a chilling tone, \"Why are you running?\"\nVictoria froze, then struggled to break free, but William's grip was too strong. \"William, let me go. You're hurting me.\"\nWilliam's deep, raspy voice carried a mocking tone, \"Do you know how excited I get every time you say it hurts in bed?\"\nHis breath brushed against Victoria's skin, sending a shiver through her body. Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment, and she gritted her teeth, \"William, don't you dare.\"\nWilliam scoffed, \"What if I do?\"\nWith that, he hoisted Victoria over his shoulder and strode towards the bedroom. Victoria was terrified, \"No! William, put me down! You're crazy, put me down.\"\nShe struggled, but William's strength was overwhelming. He threw her onto the soft bed, leaving her dizzy. In the next moment, William was on top of her, one knee pinning her down, his hand gripping her wrists, holding her in place.\nHis gaze was sharp as a knife, \"Victoria, didn't I tell you not to see other men this month? Yet here you are, rushing back from Harborview City to take care of another man.\"\nWilliam's hot breath on her neck made her body heat up. She turned her face away, not answering.\nWilliam sneered, \"Even a streetwalker has some professional ethics. You have none!\"\nHis words cut deep, and Victoria's eyes filled with tears. She stopped struggling, biting her lip, \"Yes, I'm just a whore. Do what you want.\"\nWilliam's eyes narrowed, and he felt an inexplicable irritation seeing her tear-streaked face. He released her wrists, standing up and stepping back. He wiped the sweat from his forehead with a tissue, his expression dark, \"You think I want to touch you? You're nothing but a used-up toy to me.\"\nVictoria's tears fell again at his words. She pressed her lips together, saying nothing.",

        "content": "William stared at Victoria's stubborn, restrained expression, feeling an inexplicable anger rise within him.\nHe walked over and grabbed her chin roughly, his voice harsh as he warned, \"You better behave, or when I get tired of you, let's see who'll want you then!\"\n\"Whether anyone wants me or not is none of your business!\" Victoria finally spoke, her voice weak, her eyes red and swollen.\nHe narrowed his eyes and sneered coldly, \"You better remember, we're still under contract. If you dare defy me, aren't you afraid I'll take back all the money I gave you?\"\nVictoria's eyelashes trembled. She looked up at him, biting her lower lip. \"If that's what you think, I have nothing more to say.\"\nWith that, she lowered her head, unwilling to waste any more words.\nSeeing her unyielding attitude, William laughed angrily. \"Victoria, you really don't know what's good for you!\"\nHe leaned down and kissed her lips roughly, prying open her teeth with urgency.\nVictoria's eyes widened, her pupils contracting.\nWilliam showed no mercy, his kiss leaving her lips red and swollen.\nShe tried to push him away, but he grabbed her wrists tightly.\nWilliam let out a cold laugh, increasing his grip. \"Victoria, the more you resist, the more I want to take you!\"\nWith that, he flipped her onto the bed.\n\"William.\"\nIgnoring her, he tore at her shirt, exposing her smooth shoulders.\nVictoria pressed her hands against his broad chest, trying to avoid his touch.\n\"William, don't do this.\"\nHe spread her legs, forcing her to kneel on the bed. She twisted and turned, trying to escape his invasion.\nSeeing this, William said coldly, \"You better behave tonight. My patience is limited.\"\nHe then kissed her lips again, ravaging her with intensity.\nVictoria felt dizzy from his kiss.\nSeeing her dazed expression, William smiled cruelly and removed her last piece of clothing.\nThe next moment, he entered her without hesitation.\nWilliam's movements were forceful.\nShe bit her lower lip, refusing to make a sound, letting him take what he wanted.\nHe seemed like a madman, showing no mercy as he tormented her.\nVictoria endured his fierce assault, her helpless whimpers the only sound she made.\nHer body gradually went limp, lying on the bed, letting William do as he pleased, refusing to beg or resist.\nShe had long since gotten used to this. She knew better than to expect gentleness from him.\nShe closed her eyes, tears slowly streaming down her face.\nSeeing her tears, William furrowed, his movements suddenly slowing.\nVictoria noticed his pause and opened her eyes slightly, meeting his deep gaze.\nShe stared at him in a daze.\nWilliam asked coldly, \"Why are you crying? Does being with me make you that miserable?\"\nWith that, he thrust into her a few more times.\nHer body tensed instantly.\nHe shouted, \"Scream! Why won't you scream?\"\nVictoria bit her lower lip hard, refusing to make any sound.\n\"I'll count to three. If you don't scream, I'll make you stay in this bed all night!\"\nHis tone was icy, devoid of any warmth.\nVictoria's tears flowed even more, her body trembling uncontrollably. Her voice was broken. \"William, you've helped me many times, and I'm grateful. But I'm only twenty. If it weren't for my dad's accident, I'd still be a student. My first time was with you. We've been together, but do you have to call me a whore every time you're angry? I have feelings, I have dignity too.\"\nAs she spoke, her tears flowed like a river, spilling from her eyes.\nWilliam was stunned, clearly not expecting Victoria to cry so pitifully.\nHe frowned, a complex emotion flashing in his eyes. He stared at her small face for a moment, then lost interest and withdrew from her body.\nVictoria ran into the bathroom, locking herself inside.\nWilliam stood outside, lighting cigarette after cigarette.\nThe smoke blurred his handsome, devilish features.\nHalf a pack of cigarettes later, Victoria still hadn't come out.\nWilliam kicked open the bathroom door, finding Victoria curled up on the floor, her back against the wall, trembling.\nVictoria hugged her arms, refusing to look at him.\nHe looked down at her, her body covered in marks, her skin cold to the touch.\n\"You're too old to be sulking like a little girl.\"\nWilliam turned on the shower, washing the marks from her body with warm water.\nVictoria's body stiffened. She grabbed his hand on her hip, her voice hoarse. \"Get out!\"\nIgnoring her, William gave her a hot shower, wrapped her up, and put her in bed.\nHe then found a hairdryer and roughly dried her hair.\nHis actions filled Victoria with an indescribable sadness and grievance, her tears falling continuously.\nSeeing her pitiful state, William sighed, turning her to face him. His deep eyes stared into hers. \"Do you really want to be with him?\"\nHe was referring to Samuel, his tone more serious than ever.\nVictoria stared at him, trying to understand if he was serious or testing her.\nShe knew it wasn't just her words that had an effect. William had likely seen the video Ella sent.\nEven though Alice had done such things to Lyanna to warn them, he couldn't just give up on her.\nAlice was a madwoman.\nIf they continued their entanglement, who knew what crazy things Alice would do next.\nThat's why William asked her.\nWould she choose to give up her reputation and stay with him, or be with Samuel?\nShe saw a hint of hope in his eyes. He was waiting for her answer.\nThis was her only chance.\nVictoria thought she would choose the latter without hesitation.\nBut seeing the hope in William's eyes, she felt a pang of hesitation and struggle.\nEven her heart ached a little.\nAfter all their entanglements, now that it was time to sever ties completely, she felt an inexplicable reluctance.",

        "content": "But when she thought about the video of Lyanna being beaten and humiliated as a mistress, Victoria finally made up her mind.\nLyanna was only falsely accused, but Victoria was indeed the mistress.\nVictoria's struggle vanished from her eyes with that thought.\nShe pressed her lips together and said firmly, \"Yes.\"\nWilliam's grip on her body suddenly loosened. After a long silence, a faint, indifferent smile appeared on his lips.\n\"Alright, since you've made up your mind, I'll grant your wish!\"\nWith that, he turned and walked towards the door.\nA loud bang echoed as the door slammed shut.\nVictoria stared blankly at the empty bedroom, a thin mist gradually clouding her vision.\nHe finally agreed to separate from her. She should be happy, right? But somehow, besides happiness, she felt a tinge of sadness.\nVictoria couldn't sleep. Early in the morning, she got up and made some soup to take to Samuel at the hospital.\nSamuel was still asleep.\nThe room was quiet, with only him inside.\nVictoria gently pushed the door open and walked in, placing the thermos on the counter.\nHearing the noise, Samuel looked up.\nWhen he saw her, his eyes lit up with surprise. \"Victoria.\"\nVictoria gave him a reassuring smile and walked to the bedside, speaking softly, \"How are you feeling today?\"\nSamuel smiled and exaggeratedly said, \"It hurts so much.\"\nVictoria chuckled, \"Stop pretending. It's not that bad.\"\nShe opened the thermos.\nShe poured out the chicken soup and handed it to him, speaking gently, \"Have some soup to fill your stomach. We'll do the check-up after you eat.\"\n\"Alright!\"\nHe laughed heartily, his smile bright and pure. Victoria, however, felt a faint ache in her heart.\nShe lowered her eyes, hiding the unusual look in them.\nAfter he finished the soup, Victoria prepared to leave.\nSamuel quickly grabbed her hand, \"Victoria, tonight...\"\nVictoria saw his concern and held his hand in return, smiling, \"Don't worry. I'll come see you after work. How could a girlfriend leave her boyfriend alone in the hospital?\"\nSamuel grinned, feeling warm inside, \"Alright, I'll wait for you!\"\nAfter leaving the hospital, Victoria headed straight to Starry Studio Gallery.\nWendy saw her return and greeted her with a big hug, \"Victoria, you're finally back! I missed you so much!\"\nVictoria smiled and hugged her back, handing her a gift, \"I brought you a present. See if you like it.\"\nWendy's eyes sparkled with excitement as she quickly opened the box.\nInside was a beautiful, exquisite necklace with a unique pendant design, adorned with small pink diamonds that shimmered brightly.\nThough not very expensive, it was unique and beautifully crafted.\nWendy loved it immediately, holding the necklace with delight, \"Thank you, Victoria!\"\nVictoria was happy to see her friend pleased, \"I'm glad you like it!\"\nWendy put the necklace in her bag and pulled Victoria to the desk, speaking seriously, \"Victoria, there's something I need to tell you.\"\n\"What is it?\" Victoria asked, puzzled.\nWendy gritted her teeth, \"While you were away, your mom and brother came looking for you almost every day.\"\nVictoria's eyes widened. After the last dramatic scene at the hospital, she had given all the money in her account to Nora and blocked their contacts before leaving on a business trip.\nShe hadn't expected them to come to Starry Studio Gallery to cause trouble when they couldn't reach her.\nClearly, they were dissatisfied with the few thousand dollars and came to the gallery to demand more.\nVictoria unconsciously grabbed Wendy's hand, \"Are they still coming?\"\nWendy winced in pain and pulled her hand back.\nVictoria quickly apologized, \"Sorry, Wendy, I didn't mean to hurt you.\"\nShe didn't know why she had hurt Wendy; she hadn't used much force.\n\"It's okay! It's not your fault.\" Wendy shook her head and continued, \"Don't worry. I told your mom and brother that you were fired. They didn't believe it at first and came looking for you for over half a month. They didn't see you, so they finally believed it. They haven't come in the past few days. But you should still be prepared. They won't give up easily.\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together, her hands clenched tightly.\nThey hadn't given up and still wanted to exploit her.\nShe thought for a moment and said, \"Alright, I'll be careful.\"\nAfter their conversation, Victoria was about to get some water when she noticed bruises on Wendy's wrist.\nRemembering Wendy's earlier wince, Victoria's eyes narrowed. She quickly lifted Wendy's sleeve.\nSure enough, there were red and purple bruises all over her arm.\n\"What happened? Who did this?\" Victoria frowned.\n\"It's nothing!\" Wendy hurriedly pulled her sleeve back down, explaining, \"I accidentally hit the wall! It's no big deal!\"\nAfraid Victoria might misunderstand, she added, \"I'm really fine, Victoria. Don't worry.\"\nVictoria's face turned cold, \"That's impossible. Who are you trying to fool? These are clearly finger marks, not from hitting a wall. Who did this?\"\nWendy's face turned pale instantly.\nSeeing her friend's pale face, Victoria became more determined. She gritted her teeth, \"Tell me who did this. I'll get revenge for you!\"\nShe wouldn't allow anyone to bully her friend. She would fight to the end if necessary.\n\"Victoria, I'm really fine!\" Wendy forced a bitter smile, which looked worse than crying, \"Go to work. Don't waste too much time.\"\n\"You won't tell me?\" Victoria took out her phone and dialed a few numbers, \"If you don't tell me, I'll call the police!\"\n\"No!\" Wendy was terrified and quickly stopped Victoria, pleading, \"Please don't call the police. I'll tell you!\"\nVictoria put her phone away, raising an eyebrow for her to continue.\n\"It was my mom!\" Wendy murmured, lowering her head.\n\"Your mom? Your biological mom?\" Victoria's eyes widened in shock. She hadn't expected it to be Wendy's mother.\nThen she asked, \"Why did she hit you?\"\nWendy smiled bitterly, \"Because she needs me to bring my father back home!\"",

        "content": "Victoria frowned and asked, \"What do you mean?\"\nWendy spoke with a hint of sadness, \"My dad's got a mistress, so he barely comes home anymore. Only if I'm sick or hurt.\"\nVictoria was completely stunned.\nAfter a moment, she asked again, \"So your mom makes you sick or hurt on purpose to get your dad to come home?\"\nWendy nodded bitterly, \"Yeah, I can't eat peanuts, but she puts them in my food and tells my dad I was craving them. Sometimes she even pours oil on the bathroom floor to make me slip and fall.\"\nVictoria was furious, slamming the table in anger, \"How can your mom be so cruel to her own daughter?\"\nShe could hardly believe a mother could treat her daughter this way.\nSuddenly, Victoria laughed at herself, thinking of Nora.\nThey say motherly love is instinctive, but some mothers just don't have it for their daughters.\nVictoria held Wendy's hand, asking with concern, \"But you're grown up now, why don't you leave your mom and live on your own?\"\nWendy looked up, tears streaming down her cheeks, \"Victoria, I can't leave home.\"\nVictoria was taken aback and tentatively asked, \"Is it because your mom won't let you move out?\"\nWendy lowered her eyes and nodded, \"She has severe depression. If I leave, I can't imagine what would happen. No matter how badly she treats me, she's still my mother who gave birth to and raised me. I can't just watch her die.\"\nTears glistened in Wendy's eyes as she finished speaking.\nVictoria was silent for a moment, then comforted her, \"There has to be a way.\"\nBut looking at the injuries on Wendy's hands, she felt helpless.\nThis situation seemed impossible to resolve. How could it be fixed?\nVictoria was still deep in thought when she left work.\nSamuel noticed her troubled expression and asked with concern, \"Victoria, is something wrong?\"\nVictoria sighed and said helplessly, \"It's nothing.\"\nAfter all, it was Wendy's family matter, and she didn't feel right spreading it around.\nSeeing that she didn't want to talk about it, Samuel didn't press further and changed the subject, \"Remember I told you about the University of Aesthetics Shine entrance exam?\"\nVictoria nodded, \"Of course I remember.\"\nSamuel smiled slightly, \"I confirmed with the school today. The exam is in three months, at the start of the spring semester. You need to be prepared!\"\nHearing this, Victoria's face lit up with excitement, \"Great! What subjects will be tested?\"\n\"Basic reading and writing, math for sure, and then sketching, watercolor, and quick drawing. Additionally, because it's a special admission, there's also an art appreciation test.\"\nVictoria carefully noted down each subject Samuel mentioned.\nShe had always been a good student, and although she hadn't been in school for two years, she regularly read academic materials. Reading and writing wouldn't be a problem.\nMath might be a bit challenging, though. She needed to find a way to improve.\nSeeing Victoria's eager expression, Samuel chuckled, \"Feeling confident?\"\n\"I'm not worried about the other subjects, just math. But I don't have time to attend a tutoring class,\" Victoria said, troubled.\nSamuel smiled, \"I'm pretty good at math. If I hadn't pursued art, I might have become a math teacher. How about I tutor you?\"\nVictoria's eyes lit up, and she nodded eagerly, \"Sure!\" Then she hesitated and asked, \"But with your busy schedule, how will you have time to tutor me?\"\n\"I only have two classes a day, so I have plenty of free time. Besides, you're my girlfriend now. I'd love to spend more time with you!\" Samuel said, his joy evident.\nVictoria blushed, shyly agreeing, \"Okay, then I'll come to the hospital after work for tutoring.\"\n\"Sounds good,\" Samuel replied with a warm smile.\nFor the next few days, Victoria's routine was working at Starry Studio Gallery during the day and going to the hospital for tutoring after work.\nThis continued for a week, and today Samuel was being discharged from the hospital.\nVictoria packed up her things after work, ready to go to the hospital to help with his discharge.\nBut as soon as she stepped out of Starry Studio Gallery, someone blocked her path.\nStartled, Victoria instinctively took a step back.\n\"Victoria, I need to talk to you. Can we go somewhere else to chat?\" the man said.\nVictoria frowned, looking at the man standing in front of her, \"Bobby, what is there left to say between us?\"\nBobby stared at Victoria, a slight smile playing on his lips as if he had expected her refusal, \"I've arranged to go abroad. I'll be leaving in a month. Before I go, Mom wants us to have a family dinner.\"\nVictoria's expression grew complicated as she looked at Bobby.\nSeeing her hesitation, Bobby continued, \"I know Mom and I have done a lot of wrong things to you, but I hope you can consider that we're family and that Mom is seriously ill. Please grant her this wish.\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together and finally agreed.\nBobby smiled in satisfaction and led Victoria to a mansion.\nLooking at the luxurious mansion, Victoria asked in confusion, \"Where is this?\"\nBobby forced a smile and said nonchalantly, \"This is a property Mom bought.\"\nVictoria was taken aback, then let out a sarcastic laugh.\nShe had always wondered why Nora and Bobby, despite getting so much money from Ella and Alice by exploiting her, kept crying and asking her for more money. Now she knew they had secretly bought such a big house.\nMeanwhile, she had been living in a small rental, struggling to pay for their medical and tuition fees, and relying on the subway and bus for her daily commute.\nHow ironic!\nVictoria let out a cold laugh and followed Bobby into the house.\nThe interior was lavishly decorated, no less grand than their previous home.\nNora was sitting in the living room.\nThe moment she saw Victoria, a cold glint flashed in Nora's eyes but quickly disappeared.\nNora spoke gently, \"Victoria, you're here. Come in and sit.\"\nVictoria glanced at Nora indifferently, said nothing, and walked in to sit on the couch.\nNora looked at her and said softly, \"Victoria, where have you been these days? We've been looking for you so many times but couldn't find you.\"\nHearing this, Victoria felt a surge of disgust.\nShe looked at Nora coldly and retorted, \"Where I am is none of your business. Are you still trying to ask me for money? Didn't I tell you that the money in that account was all I had?\"\nA flash of anger crossed Nora's eyes, but she quickly smiled and said, \"What are you talking about? We're family. Isn't it natural to help each other?\"",

Stop using 'family' to guilt-trip me!\"\nNora's face twisted with rage, her fingers trembling as she pointed at Victoria. \"Victoria, don't forget, I'm your mother! Without me, you wouldn't be here! How dare you speak to me like that? Watch how I teach you a lesson!\"\nBefore she finished speaking, she raised her hand and slapped Victoria hard across the face.\nThe sharp sound of the slap echoed through the living room. Victoria clutched her burning right cheek, staring blankly at Nora, then stood up to leave.\nBobby quickly stepped in, holding Nora back and whispering, \"Mom, what are you doing? We invited Victoria here for a family reunion today.\"\nHe emphasized \"reunion,\" which seemed to calm Nora down a bit.\nNora took a deep breath, steadying herself, and spoke softly, \"I just got too emotional. Are you okay? Does it hurt?\"\nBobby also tried to soothe Victoria, \"Victoria, you know Mom's health isn't great. Don't hold it against her. We're about to leave Silvermist City and go abroad. Let's not argue and just have a nice family meal.\"\nVictoria's eyes stung with unshed tears.\nBobby gently coaxed her towards the dining room.\nThe table was laden with a feast, including several of her favorite dishes.\nVictoria's anger slowly dissipated. She forced a smile and sat down next to Bobby.\nSeeing this, Nora's expression softened considerably.\nOnce all the dishes were served, Bobby picked up a piece of fish and placed it in Victoria's bowl. \"Here, Victoria, try your favorite fried fish.\"\nVictoria hesitated for a moment but eventually took it and ate.\nA glint of something flashed in Bobby's eyes, gone in an instant.\nThe meal was tasteless, and no one spoke much.\nVictoria ate in silence, not noticing that Bobby and Nora hadn't touched any of her favorite dishes.\nNora watched Victoria eat with a cold smile, a flash of malice in her eyes, but it was quickly hidden.\nVictoria had only eaten a little when she suddenly felt dizzy. She frowned, rubbing her forehead, feeling her head grow heavier.\nVictoria propped her head up, trying to keep her eyes open, looking at Bobby, who was smiling at her strangely with a glass of wine in hand.\nA chill ran down Victoria's spine. She tried to get up and run, but her body felt weak and unresponsive.\nBobby's smile widened in triumph. \"Victoria, don't struggle. Just have a good sleep.\"\nVictoria shook her head desperately, trying to stay awake, but no matter how hard she tried, she fell into unconsciousness.\nSamuel waited at the hospital, but Victoria never showed up.\nThis wasn't like her. If something had come up, she would have called.\nA sense of foreboding filled Samuel. He pulled out his phone and dialed Victoria's number.\nThe phone rang endlessly, and Samuel's brow furrowed.\nUnwilling to give up, he called again, with the same result.\nHe called Starry Studio Gallery and learned she had left work hours ago.\nA strong sense of unease gripped Samuel. Something must have happened to Victoria.\nBut with his right leg unable to support him, he could only call Ryan, asking him to send people to look for her.\nMeanwhile, William also received news of Victoria's disappearance.\nHis face darkened immediately, and he ordered Harry to find her as soon as possible.\nAfter hanging up, William walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, staring into the dark night sky, his brows knitted in worry.\nEven though Victoria had distanced herself from him, he wouldn't allow anyone to harm her.\nRemembering the pain while digging her out of the ground before, William's fists clenched tightly, his knuckles turning white.\nHe would not let Victoria be hurt again!\nWhen Victoria woke up, it was already noon the next day.\nNora had miscalculated the dosage, giving her too much sleeping medication.\nVictoria groggily opened her eyes, momentarily disoriented by the unfamiliar surroundings.\nShe tried to rub her aching head but found her hand shackled by a long chain, securing her to the room.\nVictoria let out a bitter laugh. Of course, it had come to this.\nBut she had to play her part convincingly!\nVictoria feigned terror, struggling to free herself from the chains, but it was futile.\nShe pounded on the door, shouting, \"Help! Let me out! Let me out now!\"\nThe loud banging echoed through the room.\nAfter a while, she heard the sound of a key turning in the lock, followed by the door opening.\nNora and Bobby stood in the doorway.\nSeeing Victoria awake, Nora smiled and walked slowly towards her.\nVictoria looked at them in disbelief, her eyes wary. \"Mom, what are you doing? I'm your daughter! You drugged me and locked me up!\"\nShe had thought their betrayal and threats were the worst they could do, but now they had resorted to kidnapping and confinement.\nNora sneered, \"You defied me.\"\nBobby chimed in, \"I told you last time, give me more money, and I won't bother you again. But there was only a couple of thousand dollars in the account. Is that really all you have? You tricked me, so don't blame me for being ruthless!\"\nVictoria shouted angrily, \"Bobby, you know how much Mom's medical bills cost, and Dad's debts-William paid for all of it! It's too shamelessly to ask for more. I have no money now!\"\nBobby's face darkened, his eyes cold as he glared at Victoria. \"I had to drop out of the University of Aesthetics Shine and go abroad because of you! Fine, I believe you have no money. But you know how much it costs to go abroad, and you could have found a way to get it. Why didn't you?\"\n\"You're a jerk! I should never have helped you! You falsely accused me, and now it's my fault?\" she snapped back.",

As his sister, shouldn't you be thinking about him? Just ask William for more money, and we'll let you go right away. You know William spoils you; if you ask, he'll definitely give it to you.\"\nVictoria's chest rose and fell with fury. \"William has never liked me, let alone spoiled me! Stop dreaming. He won't give it!\"\nNora's eyes narrowed, her tone suddenly sharp. \"Victoria, are you forcing me to use other means to make you comply?\"\nVictoria wasn't afraid of her threats. \"You wouldn't dare!

Nora's tactics were too despicable, leaving her with no way to fight back.\nShe took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down.\nShe couldn't afford to get agitated now, or she would be even more at their mercy.\nVictoria closed her eyes, slowly calming her emotions before reopening them. She looked at Nora and Bobby with indifference, her voice hoarse. \"Fine, I'll ask him for money. How much do you want?\"\nVictoria's sudden change in attitude caught Bobby and Nora off guard.\nThey exchanged glances, and Bobby quickly said, \"Twenty million dollars!\"\n\"Twenty million dollars?\" Victoria gasped, then scoffed. \"You're really asking for the moon!\"\nBobby sneered at Victoria, speaking as if it were only natural. \"For people like them, twenty million dollars is nothing. Besides, studying abroad costs hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Will you care about me in the future? I have to ask for more at once. And twenty million dollars is already a bargain for you. After all, you're his mistress. William wouldn't want to shortchange you, right?\"\n\"You're shameless and greedy. How could I have a brother like you!\" Victoria was so furious that her chest heaved even more violently.\nSeeing Victoria's reaction, Bobby angrily rushed over, grabbed her collar, and slapped her hard across the face.\nVictoria was thrown to the ground, blood trickling from the corner of her mouth.\nBobby wasn't done. He grabbed Victoria's hair, threatening her viciously. \"Bitch, if you don't get the twenty million dollars, I'll lock you up until you die!\"\nVictoria clutched her scalp in pain, her anger erupting like a volcano.\nShe forgot her original plans and schemes. She had had enough of their threats and torment. At this moment, she only wanted to take them down with her!\nShe suddenly got up, wrapping the chain around Bobby's neck and pulling with all her might. \"Even if I die, I'll take you with me!\"\nNora screamed in terror, \"Victoria! Let go!\"\nBobby was stunned by Victoria's sudden action but quickly started struggling desperately.\n\"Let go, you psycho! When I get my hands on you, you'll wish you were dead!\" Bobby gasped, his face turning red.\nVictoria couldn't believe he was still threatening her at this point!\nHer eyes were bloodshot, and she gritted her teeth, pulling the chain tighter, wanting to strangle him.\nBobby began to feel breathless, his body weakening, and his vision blurring.\nNora's face turned pale with fear, shouting, \"Victoria, let go! You'll kill him!\"\nVictoria ignored her, not loosening her grip at all.\nSeeing Victoria's determination, Nora panicked. She grabbed a nearby bottle and smashed it over Victoria's head.\nThe sound of the bottle shattering echoed through the room. Victoria felt a hot sensation on her head, blood streaming down her face, blurring her vision.\nVictoria finally let go, collapsing weakly to the ground.\nBobby coughed violently, spitting out a mouthful of water.\nHe kicked Victoria over and over again. \"Damn it! You bitch! How dare you hurt me! I'll cripple you today!\"\nVictoria lay on the ground, letting Bobby kick her. She stared at the ceiling, feeling empty and desolate inside.\nShe didn't cry or scream, lying there quietly like a soulless shell, unresponsive to Bobby's beating.\n'Bobby, Nora, you forced me to this.' \nSuddenly, the door was kicked open, and a swarm of police officers rushed in.\nBobby was taken out of the villa, surrounded by flashing cameras that nearly blinded him.\nHe stared wide-eyed in terror, his hands cuffed in front of him, red marks on his wrists. His legs trembled so much that he could barely move without the police's support.\nIt wasn't until he was shoved into the police car that he snapped out of it, screaming, \"I didn't do it! I'm being framed! Someone set me up!\"\nBobby was taken away, and the reporters followed him to the police station.\nWilliam leaned against his Maybach, the cigarette in his fingers glowing and fading, casting sharp shadows on his face. He watched the commotion at the villa gradually die down, then stubbed out his cigarette and floored the gas pedal, crashing through the police barricade.\n\"Mr. Scott, you can't go in.\"\nHe rolled down the window, tugging at his tie, his eyes cold as ice. \"I'm the victim's family.\"\nThe warehouse door creaked open, the smell of mold and blood hitting him.\nWilliam's pupils contracted.\nVictoria crouched in the corner, her ankle raw and bloody from the chain, her forehead wound crudely bandaged.\nShe held a cup of water, sipping it slowly.\nHe shrugged off his coat, striding over to wrap it around her trembling body, his voice tight with suppressed rage. \"You risked your life to make them pay?\"\n\"Life?\" She suddenly grabbed his collar, her nails digging into his skin. \"They framed me, humiliated me, and took my money, and I could overlook all of it!\"\nHer eyes burned with madness. \"But they shouldn't have deceived my father. Bobby isn't even my dad's child.\"",

        "content": "Tears streamed down her face, staining his expensive shirt with blotchy marks.\n\"What?\" William's frown deepened. He reached out to wipe the tears from her cheeks, his voice gentle, \"Come on, get up.\"\nVictoria shook her head, her gaze distant as she murmured, \"I always wondered why my mom hated me so much. Then your aunt told me that my parents had a huge fight about a divorce over a decade ago. I started digging and found out my mom had been cheating. Bobby is her child with that man. She stayed married to my dad only for the money. My dad knew about her infidelity, but she used my custody to threaten him, so he never divorced her.\"\nShe choked up, her eyes brimming with tears, as if recalling something painfully despairing.\nWilliam's heart clenched, his dark eyes fixed on her.\nVictoria continued, tears falling like broken pearls, \"They treated my dad and me like fools.\"\nSo, even though she knew Bobby had bad intentions, she still followed him into their trap.\nShe had already contacted Elara's son, Robert, to have him report to the police as a lawyer the next day.\nIt was all her plan; she should have been happy.\nVictoria laughed bitterly, hysterically, her eyes full of despair, \"It didn't have to end this way.\"\nWilliam couldn't stand seeing her like this. He leaned down and hugged her frail shoulders, his deep voice comforting, \"They got what they deserved.\"\nHer body stiffened, then she slowly lifted her head, her clear eyes staring at William with a complex emotion.\nVictoria looked at William's handsome face and smiled bitterly, \"I've become just as despicable as them. It's really frustrating!\"\nScheming, setting traps-how was she any different from Bobby and Nora?\nImprisonment, extortion, intentional harm-Bobby's life was ruined.\nWilliam just looked at her, understanding all her thoughts and emotions.\nSuddenly, he stepped forward and pulled her into his arms.\nVictoria trembled, slowly raising her hands to wrap around his waist, holding tighter and tighter.\n\"Victoria!\"\nA scream came from the doorway. Nora, disheveled and haggard, rushed in. Seeing Victoria, her eyes flared with anger, and she raised her hand to strike.\nWilliam's eyes flashed coldly, and he quickly grabbed her hand, forcefully pushing it aside.\nHarry arrived with others, hurriedly restraining the out-of-control Nora.\nDue to her severe illness, she hadn't been arrested but was under house arrest for medical treatment.\nNora lost her balance and fell to the ground. She tried to get up twice but couldn't, and she shouted at Victoria with hatred, \"Victoria, why did you do this? He's your brother! Your own brother! He was my pride and hope! Why did you destroy him?\"\nNora cried hysterically, completely losing her usual composure, struggling like a mad beast. \"You've ruined our lives. I hate you! I hate you!\"\nVictoria stood frozen, staring blankly at Nora's hysterical curses.\n\"Victoria, how can you be so cruel? I beg you to spare Bobby, okay? I'm begging you. He did nothing wrong! Kill me instead, let me take his place, okay?\" Nora's voice trembled, her eyes full of pleading. She crawled on the ground, clutching Victoria's leg, desperately begging, \"Victoria, I know I wronged you before, but now, I beg you to spare Bobby, please!\"\nVictoria looked at Nora kneeling at her feet, her eyes stinging, hot tears sliding down her cheeks.\nShe tilted her head back, closing her eyes, her throat dry, \"Even now, you still want to lie to me? He's not even my dad's child.\"\nNora froze, not expecting Victoria to know.\nThen, veins bulged on her forehead, and she pointed at Victoria, cursing angrily, \"The biggest regret of my life is giving birth to you, you jinx! Why don't you just die? Die!\"\nVictoria's heart felt hollow, a faint pain spreading.\nWilliam turned his head, coldly looking at Nora on the ground. \"Take her out.\"\nAs soon as he spoke, he felt a force around his waist. Victoria's hands were tightly wrapped around him.\nHe looked down at Victoria, seeing her use all her strength, her voice faint but firm, \"Don't hurt her.\"\nWilliam's brows furrowed, feeling both helpless and compassionate towards Victoria's kindness.\nNora was her biological mother, so what?\nAll these years, when had Nora ever truly cared for her?\nWhen she needed support the most, Nora only knew how to take from her, never considering her tough situation.\nShe was so young, yet she bore the family's burdens alone.\nAnd Nora? Not only did she not give her any warmth, but she also hurt her so recklessly, which made William incredibly angry.\nBut despite his anger, William signaled to Harry.\nHarry understood and didn't make things difficult for Nora.\nNora seemed to suddenly realize, trying to grab William, but Harry immediately stepped in to stop her.\n\"William! Don't forget, she's Alvin's daughter, the root of all this! Why are you helping her?\"\nWilliam lowered his gaze, looking at Victoria in his arms.\nYes, she was Alvin's daughter. He hadn't forgotten.\nBut so what?\nRight now, all he wanted was to protect her, to keep her from any more harm.\n\"Take her back to the hospital!\" William ordered Harry.\n\"Yes.\" Harry obeyed.\nNora shouted unwillingly, \"William! How can you help her? Her father\"\n\"Shut her up!\" William commanded coldly, his gaze chilling.\nHarry immediately moved, gagging Nora and dragging her out.\nVictoria watched Nora, who kept cursing her, gradually disappear, and tears fell uncontrollably.\nWilliam's heart ached. He bent down, holding Victoria close to his chest, patting her back, his voice soft, \"Don't cry, sweetheart.\"\nVictoria leaned on his shoulder, smelling the faint scent of tobacco on him, feeling a sharp sting in her nose.\nShe sobbed, her voice hoarse as she apologized, \"I'm sorry for troubling you again.\"\nWilliam sighed, shaking his head, wiping the tears from her cheeks.\nVictoria was too kind, always bullied without fighting back.\nHe gently wiped her tear stains, speaking softly, \"No more crying from now on.\"\nVictoria sniffled, her nose red and swollen, nodding.\nHe held her hand, leading her out of the room. Suddenly, Victoria felt the world spinning.\nShe finally couldn't hold on, her body going limp, collapsing into William's arms.\nSeeing her faint, William's face changed drastically. He quickly bent down, lifting her in his arms, and hurried out the door.",

        "content": "As he held her, he was stunned by how frail she had become, her body feeling almost weightless.\nHe cradled her gently, afraid that even the slightest pressure might hurt her.\nVictoria was rushed to the hospital, and it was only then that William learned about the various tortures she had endured while being held captive.\nHer ankle wound, untreated for too long, had become severely infected. She had multiple soft tissue injuries, and a heavy blow to her forehead might leave a scar. The concussion she suffered was also quite serious.\nLooking at the unconscious Victoria on the hospital bed, William's eyes were as cold as ice, his entire presence radiating a chilling aura.\nHe knew she had chosen this path herself, but he couldn't suppress the fury burning inside him.\nNo one who hurt her would escape unscathed.\nSince she had suffered so much, he would make sure Bobby and Nora paid a heavy price!\n\"Get that house under Nora's name transferred to Victoria,\" William ordered Harry in a low voice.\nHarry was momentarily stunned. \"Mr. Scott, you mean...?\"\n\"The money for that house came from framing Victoria. It rightfully belongs to her. As for how to get Nora to agree, figure it out.\"\nWilliam's tone was calm, as if he were discussing something trivial.\nHarry understood and nodded.\nAfter a night of treatment, Victoria felt much better.\nThe door to her hospital room slowly opened, and a figure appeared in the doorway.\nVictoria looked up and saw Samuel.\nSamuel, in a wheelchair, struggled to push himself to her bedside. He looked at Victoria's pale face, his eyes flickering with emotion.\nHis assistant placed a thermos on the table and opened it, revealing steaming oatmeal.\nSamuel quietly watched Victoria for a moment before speaking. \"I brought you some oatmeal. You should eat a little.\"\nVictoria nodded slightly and said softly, \"Thanks, Samuel.\"\nA bitter smile appeared on Samuel's lips. \"Why didn't you contact me first? I had to hear about it from your colleagues.\"\nVictoria lowered her head, feeling a bit guilty. \"I just didn't want to worry you.\"\n\"But you could contact William?\" Samuel's tone was tinged with dissatisfaction and hurt.\nVictoria quickly explained, \"No, I contacted Elara's son, Robert. I didn't reach out to William; he came on his own.\"\nSamuel took a deep breath, a hint of self-mockery flashing across his face. \"You thought of others but not me.\"\n\"It's not like that, Samuel. Please don't misunderstand...\"\n\"Just eat something first.\" Samuel interrupted her, his mood low, but he still carefully serving the oatmeal and handing it to Victoria.\nVictoria took the oatmeal, feeling a bit uneasy.\nShe hadn't contacted Samuel because she didn't want to burden him. The situation she was involved in was complicated, and she would feel even more guilty if he got dragged into it.\nBut now, she felt like she had indeed hurt him.\nSamuel watched Victoria's thoughtful expression, then turned slightly to face her directly. \"Victoria, you said you wanted to be with me.\"\nVictoria had no response. She had let him down.\n\"But when you were in danger, you didn't think of me first and kept me in the dark. Do you know how much that hurt? It shows that I'm not important enough to you, that I haven't done enough to make you trust me.\"\nVictoria hurried to explain, \"It's really not what you think. I was just so panicked at the time, only thinking about how to escape. I didn't consider everything.\"\n\"So, you didn't intentionally ignore me?\"\n\"Of course not, Samuel. You mean a lot to me.\"\nSamuel looked into Victoria's sincere eyes and nodded. \"Alright, I believe you.\"\nVictoria breathed a sigh of relief but still felt a bit uneasy.\nSamuel chatted with Victoria for a while, and the conversation turned to her family.\n\"What are you going to do about your mom?\" Samuel asked.\nVictoria's eyes dimmed. \"I don't know. She's always hated me. This incident might make her hate me even more.\"\nSamuel hesitated before saying, \"I heard her condition has worsened. She might need a kidney transplant.\"\nVictoria's hand trembled slightly as she looked up at him.\n\"If they can't find a suitable donor, they'll have to look for a match among relatives. Your mom doesn't have other close relatives, so...\"\n\"It's just me and Bobby,\" Victoria said calmly.\nShe had anticipated this outcome long ago.\nIn fact, she had already decided that if there was no other way, she would give one of her kidneys to her mother.\nSamuel sat nearby, his brows furrowed, his gaze fixed on Victoria's face, wanting to speak but holding back.\nNora had always been harsh on her, often withholding the care she deserved. But blood ties were hard to sever, and how could he persuade her to give up on saving Nora?\nIf he were in her shoes, he wouldn't be able to make such a choice either.\nHowever, Victoria seemed particularly serene, showing little worry. She said lightly, \"If it really comes to that, maybe it would be a kind of release for me.\"\nShe felt that the suffering she had endured over the years was like a long journey of repaying debts.\nIf she could repay Nora's debt of raising her with her kidney, it might be a good ending.\nSamuel's hospital was elsewhere, and the on-duty doctor had called several times urging him to return.\nHe wheeled himself forward a few steps, then suddenly stopped and turned back, hugging Victoria tightly, his arms closing around her.\nVictoria stiffened, letting him hold her. After a moment, she reached out and hugged him back.\nSamuel's voice sounded in her ear, \"Victoria, I'm your boyfriend. You need to learn to rely on me. I'll always be there for you.\"\nHearing this, Victoria felt a warmth in her heart, her eyes moistening.\nYes, since she had chosen to be with him, she should forget the past and start anew.\nShe closed her eyes, trying to hold back her tears. \"Thank you, Samuel.\"\nSamuel pulled away and tucked her in. \"Get some rest.\"\n\"Okay, be careful on your way back,\" Victoria reminded him.\nSamuel nodded and gave her a bright smile.\nJust then, the door opened.\nIt was William.\nHe held a document in his hand and saw the intimate embrace between the two. His eyes instantly turned cold.\nSamuel looked at him, seemingly oblivious to his dark expression, and smiled. \"Mr. Scott, thanks for bringing my Victoria to the hospital.\"\nHe emphasized \"my Victoria.\"\nWilliam glanced at Victoria, then regained his composure, his indifferent gaze shifting to Samuel. \"It was nothing.\"\n\"Victoria, I'll see you tomorrow,\" Samuel said.\nVictoria nodded, watching Samuel leave.\nWilliam stood by, his face growing darker, the air around him thick with an oppressive tension.\nAfter Samuel left, the room became eerily quiet. Victoria swallowed nervously, sneaking a glance at William.\nShe noticed his fists clenched at his sides, his nails digging into his palms.\nVictoria's heart tightened, feeling inexplicably guilty.\n\"Do you love him?\" William suddenly asked, his voice icy, as if laced with shards of ice.\nVictoria, feeling guilty, avoided his gaze and stammered, \"He's my boyfriend. Of course, I love him.\"\nWilliam stared at Victoria, his pupils contracting, a surge of anger igniting within him.",

She instinctively took a step back, hiding behind the hospital bed.\nWilliam saw the fear and panic in Victoria's eyes, and a dull ache passed through his heart.\nHe struggled to control the anger and bitterness churning inside him, speaking as gently and slowly as he could, \"What about me?\"\nVictoria froze, lifting her head in confusion to meet his dark eyes.\n\"What do we mean to each other?\" he asked.\n\"I...\" Victoria opened her mouth but couldn't form a complete sentence.\nWilliam stepped closer, his large hand gripping Victoria's chin, forcing her to look directly at him.\n\"Speak. Say you like me,\" William commanded forcefully.\nVictoria's eyelashes fluttered, a thousand thoughts racing through her mind, finally condensing into one sentence: \"William, you know it's impossible between us.\"\nWilliam took a deep breath, the anger in his chest nearly exploding. His arm muscles tensed, veins bulging, and his temple throbbed.\n\"But I love you,\" he said hoarsely, revealing the words he'd kept hidden in his heart for so long.\nTears welled up in Victoria's eyes, streaming down her pale, dry cheeks.\nShe never thought she would hear him confess his love to her one day.\nShe always believed he would never say he loved her.\nWilliam's heart softened as he saw her cry. He leaned down and kissed her tears, the salty taste filling his mouth.\nWilliam's movements were gentle, and Victoria gradually stopped resisting. She closed her eyes, letting the tears fall.\nHow could she not know his feelings for her?\nBut there were too many obstacles between them, too deep.\nElla, Alice, and her father, Alvin-each one was a stumbling block between them.\nSensing her acquiescence, William deepened his gaze. He lowered his head and kissed Victoria's swollen, pink lips from crying.\nVictoria's eyes widened, and she struggled to push him away.\nBut William's strength was too great; Victoria couldn't resist at all.\n\"Let go,\" Victoria whimpered, needing to breathe.\n\"Don't call out, or you'll bring the doctors and nurses here. Do you want us to be embarrassed?\" William whispered in her ear, with a hint of coaxing.\nVictoria immediately fell silent, looking at him pitifully.\nSeeing this, William's eyes burned with intensity. He kissed her slender neck, leaving intimate red marks.\nHis kisses grew deeper, his breathing becoming more rapid, his hand slipping under her clothes.\n\"No!\" Victoria's soft moan escaped, her body going limp.\nWilliam's body tensed even more, his lips pressing against her skin, leaving his unique mark on her, ensuring she would always remember his presence.\nVictoria was on the verge of losing her sanity from his teasing.\n\"William, stop,\" she pleaded, squirming.\nInstead of stopping, William became even more brazen.\nHis kisses trailed down her neck, finally landing on her chest, sucking and leaving vivid red marks.\nVictoria's body trembled, a wave of numbness spreading through her, making her moan uncontrollably.\nWilliam's voice was low and husky, seductive enough to captivate, \"Say my name.\"\n\"William!\" Victoria's voice was tinged with desire.\n\"Say it again,\" William urged, his hands not pausing for a moment.\nVictoria had completely lost the ability to think. Her already sensitive body became weak under his teasing, her back arching, one leg wrapping around his waist, allowing him to take what he wanted.\n\"William!\" Victoria called his name softly, her tone filled with intense longing.\n\"Keep saying it,\" William's voice grew even deeper and raspier.\n\"William!\" Victoria whispered, wrapping her arms around William's neck.\nSensing her response, William's eyes flashed with a fiery light.\nHe suddenly flipped her over, pressing Victoria beneath him, proving his decision with his actions.\nWilliam kissed Victoria's soft lips dominantly, his hands skillfully unbuttoning her hospital gown.\nHe had never been so crazed in his desire, wanting to consume Victoria entirely.\nWilliam's tall, muscular body exuded a deadly charm with every curve.\nHis large hands deftly removed all her restraints, entering her body without hesitation.\nHe lowered his head, burying it in her chest, sucking hard on her soft, full breasts.\nIt had been a long time, and Victoria's body felt some pain. She frowned, groaning softly.\nWilliam looked up, seeing her furrowed brows, his eyes filled with worry, his heart aching.\nHe reached out, gently smoothing the wrinkles between her brows, his voice soft, \"Does it hurt?\"\nVictoria shook her head, gritting her teeth to endure his rough invasion, tears welling up in her eyes.\n\"I'm sorry,\" his voice was thick with emotion, \"Victoria, I'm sorry, I can't control myself.\"\nHis words hit her heart like a heavy blow, and Victoria froze.\n\"In this lifetime, I'll only be like this with you,\" William cupped her face, his lips brushing her soft ear, speaking hoarsely.\nVictoria's body instantly stiffened, tears welling up again.\nSeeing her cry, William panicked, quickly grabbing tissues to wipe her tears, \"Victoria, please don't cry.\"\nVictoria slowly opened her tear-filled eyes, gazing at his handsome face.\nShe didn't want to admit it, but even knowing he was just acting on impulse, she couldn't help but feel moved.\nBut there were too many things between them.\nVictoria lowered her eyes, her rationality gradually returning.\nShe stared at William for a long time before speaking hoarsely, \"I'm sorry, William, I'm Samuel's girlfriend now, we can't...\"\nBefore she could finish, William's anger flared.\nHe lifted one of Victoria's legs, hooking it around his waist, thrusting in hard.\nWilliam's well-built body moved with precision, his teeth grazing Victoria's earlobe, sweat dripping from the intense pleasure, \"Victoria, you still owe me a few days from our month together, you have to make it up.\"\nVictoria's struggles were futile, his large member filling her completely, the folds of her inner walls stretching to accommodate him, the fullness spreading from her tailbone to her brain, making her arch her back, exposing her long neck, and letting out soft moans.\nWilliam gripped her slender waist, thrusting forward, his member plunging into her with each movement, pulling out completely before disappearing again.\nVictoria was tormented, her cheeks flushed, her delicate body arching, \"William!\"\nWilliam couldn't bear to let her go, capturing her small mouth, kissing her passionately.\nVictoria felt like she was on a roller coaster, her world spinning.\nWilliam didn't stop, wave after wave of intense pleasure crashing over her.\nHe stood, thrusting upward, his thick member like a giant snake, entering her deeply.\nVictoria felt her waist sink, her upper body arching back, her back forming a beautiful curve.\nVictoria clung to the bedsheet, her nails digging in, leaving five clear marks.\nThe intense pleasure overwhelmed her nerves, making her moan softly.",

Victoria let out a scream before succumbing to the wave of pleasure that washed over her.\nHe couldn't help but quicken his pace, while Victoria was nearly melting, her soft, breathy moans more arousing than the filthiest words.\nWilliam was nearing his limit, feeling himself losing control.\nHis strong waist muscles tensed, his leg muscles bulged, and sweat dripped down his body.\nAs he climaxed, he held Victoria tightly against him, his hot member pulsing inside her.\nAfterwards, their naked bodies lay intertwined on the bed, Victoria's face flushed a deep red.\nWilliam lay on top of her, gently kissing her face.\nSuddenly, Victoria's phone rang, pulling her back to reality.\nIt was Samuel, her boyfriend.\nVictoria's face turned pale, the images of her and William's entanglement still vivid in her mind.\nShe felt utterly despicable. She had Samuel, yet she had slept with William.\nSamuel was her only salvation. How could she betray him?\nWith trembling fingers, she swiped the screen and answered the call.\n\"Victoria, why did it take you so long to answer?\" Samuel's warm, pleasant voice came through the phone, and Victoria could almost picture his smiling face.\nA complex emotion flashed in Victoria's eyes. She bit her lip and whispered, \"I was just drinking some water.\"\nThere was a brief pause before Samuel spoke again, \"You sound strange. Is everything okay?\"\nVictoria gripped the phone tightly, guilt and shame flooding her heart. \"I'm fine, I just choked a little.\"\n\"I see,\" Samuel said, not suspecting anything. \"I'm at the hospital now. Get some rest, goodnight.\"\nSamuel hung up, and two hot tears rolled down Victoria's cheeks.\nIn this relationship, Samuel had given so much more than she had.\nHow could she let a few sweet words from William lead her to betray Samuel?\n\"Do you regret it?\" William's voice drifted over.\nVictoria snapped back to reality, meeting his deep gaze.\nTears glistened in her eyes as she shook her head and choked out, \"William, you need to leave. Don't come looking for me again.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" William's anger flared, and he slammed his hand on the nightstand, shattering the intimate atmosphere. \"We were just making love, and now you want to cut ties?\"\n\"What else can I do?\" Victoria mustered the courage to look up at him. \"Will you break up with Alice?\"\nAt the mention of Alice, William's expression turned cold.\nHe loved Victoria, but he couldn't leave Alice.\nHe owed her.\nVictoria took a deep breath and spoke again, \"I believe you have feelings for me, but William, you're going to marry her. Do you want me to be the mistress everyone despises?\"\nVictoria closed her eyes, waiting for his answer.\nBut William remained silent.\nThe room was deathly quiet, the spring rain tapping against the window.\nAfter a long while, William's hoarse voice broke the silence, \"Victoria, can't you just hang in there for me? I'll try to make it up to you.\"\nMake it up to her? Victoria let out a bitter laugh. Compensation was not what she needed.\nHer heart ached as she slowly opened her eyes, staring at the chandelier on the ceiling. Her voice was distant, \"William, either you break up with Alice,\" she paused, \"or you never show up in front of me again.\"\nWilliam's breath hitched, his grip on her shoulder tightening, veins bulging as if he might explode any second.\nHe gritted his teeth and said, \"Fine, if that's what you want, I'll fulfill your wish!\"\nVictoria exhaled sharply at his words.\nWilliam climbed off her, picked up his clothes from the floor, dressed, and left.\nVictoria watched his broad back disappear through the door, her eyes welling up with tears.\nShe picked up the documents William had left behind. It was the transfer agreement for Nora's house. If she signed it, the house would be hers.\nShe tossed the papers onto the table and covered her face, silently crying.\nWilliam stepped out of the building, a cold wind hitting him, making him shiver.\nHe stood by the roadside, lighting a cigarette and taking a slow drag, exhaling smoke.\nHe squinted, a dull ache in his chest. This feeling was unbearable.\nThe hospital's test results were in. In a twist of fate, Victoria was a perfect match for Nora.\nNora's condition was critical. Without a transplant soon, she would miss the best window for treatment.\nVictoria faced a tough decision: save Nora or bear the burden of guilt.\nAs Victoria was about to enter the doctor's office, she ran into Nora.\nNora looked haggard, a far cry from her once proud self. Her hair was disheveled, her face pale, and wrinkles lined her features.\nSupported by a nurse, she stood weakly, but upon seeing Victoria, a cold glint flashed in her eyes, and a mocking smile curled her lips, her gaze locking onto Victoria.\nVictoria understood her thoughts. Nora was certain Victoria wouldn't refuse to donate her kidney.\nBut if Bobby had been the match, Nora would never have accepted his kidney.\nThe attending physician, Dr. Myers, approached Victoria with the consent form for the surgery.\nHanding it to her, Dr. Myers spoke earnestly, \"Victoria, you're still young. You need to think this through carefully. Maybe talk to your friends and get their opinions.\"\nNora scoffed, \"Dr. Myers, what are you implying? Are you trying to stop my daughter from saving me? Aren't doctors supposed to save lives? Why are you holding me back?\"\nDr. Myers frowned, patiently explaining, \"This is a necessary process. We have to save lives, but we can't harm others in the process.\"\n\"It's just a kidney! I gave birth to her, she owes me! She should give me her life if I ask for it!\" Nora's words grew harsher, and a nearby nurse couldn't help but mutter, \"How can she say that? Is she really her mother?\"",

        "content": "\"I'll sign.\"\nVictoria didn't hesitate for a second.\nThe more Nora pressured her, the more she wanted to end it all quickly and cut ties with her.\nShe picked up the pen and swiftly signed her name. Then she asked Dr. Myers in detail about the surgery schedule and precautions, planning to arrange her work around it.\nBack home, she called Elara and told her everything that had happened.\nElara was furious, stomping her foot. \"Are you out of your mind? You're messing with your health! Even if you have another kidney, this is gonna take a toll on your body. You're not even married yet. What if your future husband finds out you had this surgery? Even if he doesn't care, you wouldn't want to be a burden, would you?\"\nElara tried to talk some sense into her. \"Forget about your mom. After everything she's done to you, why do you still care? If you ruin your health, what about your dad's injustice? He'd want you to live well. If something happens to you because of this surgery, how could you face him?\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes, holding back tears.\nShe thought she was mentally prepared, but when Elara mentioned Alvin, her heart ached sharply.\nShe had indeed overlooked Alvin's feelings and could imagine how heartbroken he would be if he knew.\nAfter a long pause, she said softly, \"Elara, please don't tell Samuel or anyone else about this.\"\nSeeing that she couldn't persuade her, Elara sighed helplessly and turned away.\nElara was both angry and heartbroken. She wanted to scold her, but seeing Victoria's forced strength and lonely helplessness, she just couldn't bring herself to.\nWith a mother like that, what could she do?\nCould she really just watch Nora die?\nIf Victoria refused, Nora would definitely spread it around, using blood tie and morality to guilt-trip her, making her live in guilt and blame for the rest of her life.\n\"What a misfortune!\" Elara's eyes reddened. She stopped trying to persuade her and just asked, \"What about Samuel? Would he agree if he knew?\"\n\"He doesn't agree, but he said he'd respect my decision. He had a car accident recently, and I didn't tell him about the surgery.\"\nElara hesitated but finally said, \"Victoria, if you go through with this surgery, Samuel's parents might not accept you.\"\nVictoria's expression was calm as she nodded. \"I know. If they really oppose it, there's nothing I can do.\"\nThis surgery made her see reality clearly.\nThe ordinary happiness she longed for might never be achievable.\nElara felt sorry for her. \"Samuel truly likes you. He's done a lot for you. It would be a shame to give up now.\"\n\"Elara,\" Victoria forced a smile, \"I don't want this either.\"\nElara's heart ached. Seeing the tears in Victoria's eyes, she hugged her tightly and sighed softly.\nThree days before the surgery, Victoria went to the hospital alone.\nShe had to be admitted with Nora for pre-surgery checks. She felt she could handle these procedures herself and didn't ask Elara to accompany her.\nNora had been released on bail. Occasionally, they ran into each other during the checks, but they acted like strangers, with no interaction.\nOnly when Victoria wasn't looking, Nora would glare at her with cold, venomous eyes.\nVictoria treated her like a stranger, focused solely on repaying the debt of birth and then cutting ties forever.\nThe smell of disinfectant stung her nose as Victoria slowly made her way back to her room after a blood draw, leaning against the wall.\nThe needle marks on her pale skin were bruised. She pulled her sleeve down but froze when she opened the door.\nA tall figure stood by the window, back facing her.\nThe man wore a sharp suit, broad shoulders, and a narrow waist, exuding a cold, unapproachable aura.\nHis hands were in his pockets, and despite the comfortable room temperature, he seemed to bring a chill with him, making the air around him colder.\nHis coat was casually draped over the sofa, and a black suitcase sat on the floor, making him look travel-worn.\nHearing the noise, he turned abruptly, the cold glint from his wristwatch flashing across her terrified face.\nVictoria was slightly taken aback. She hadn't expected to see him again so soon, at least not so suddenly.\nShe walked in slowly, discarding the cotton ball pressed against her arm and pulling down her sleeve to hide the needle marks and bruises.\nSeeing him turn but not speak, Victoria broke the silence first. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\"You're donating a kidney to Nora?\" William leaned against the window, crushing a cigarette between his fingers, the embers falling onto his handmade shoes.\nHis eyes, filled with suppressed anger, bore into her. \"Victoria, do you have a brain in that head of yours?\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together, not answering.\nShe felt it was her decision and didn't need to explain it to anyone.\nWilliam was infuriated by her silence, a cold, humorless smile flashing across his stern face, carrying a sharp edge.\n\"I think you're being incredibly stupid!\"\nHe took a deep breath, but the coldness around him remained, as he stepped closer, his smile dangerous. \"What is Nora to you? How dare she ask for your kidney?\"\nVictoria lifted her chin slightly, watching him approach.\nThis was a side of William she had never seen. Even when angry, he had always been controlled and restrained.\nBut now, he seemed to have lost all reason, driven by a need to vent his fury.\n\"Do you think you're some kind of savior? Or just a pawn to be trampled on?\" William sneered. \"What makes Nora worthy of your sacrifice? Does she deserve it?\"\nHe stopped in front of her, looking down, his eyes dark and menacing.\nVictoria clenched her fists, her chest heaving.\nHis words hit her deepest wounds, and she struggled to hold back her tears.\nWilliam let out a cold laugh, mocking her. \"You always have a sharp tongue with me, never taking any crap. But with Nora and Bobby, you just take it, letting them walk all over you?\"\nHe reached out, roughly grabbing her chin, forcing her to look at him. \"If you want to be this foolish, you need my permission first!\"\nVictoria desperately tried to avoid his touch, struggling to break free. \"Let go! I don't need your permission!\"\nWilliam stared at her coldly, his deep eyes flashing with a terrifying intensity. \"I forbid it! If you donate that kidney, I'll make sure she dies first!\"\nVictoria trembled, biting her lip, her stubbornness evoking pity.\nWilliam's heart softened, and he wanted to pull her into his arms, to kiss away all her pain and sorrow until she gave in.\nBut he couldn't.\nVictoria shouldn't have to endure this suffering.\n\"William, I understand your concern,\" Victoria choked out, \"but she's my mom. No matter how bad she is, I can't just watch her die. If I did, I'd be in agony for the rest of my life. Can you understand that?\"\nSeeing her still so determined, William felt a surge of frustration.\nHe grabbed her frail arm and pushed her away, his tone harsh. \"Victoria! If so, I'll make her disappear right now! Let's see how she can hurt you then!\"\nWilliam, in his rage, seemed like a wild beast out of control. Victoria, frightened by his intensity, instinctively hugged him from behind, her voice trembling. \"Don't go!\"\n\"Let go!\"",

        "content": "William was fuming as he sped back into town, having dropped everything the moment he got the news. He'd completely forgotten Victoria's words about not wanting to see him again.\nThe whole way back, his anger at Victoria's naivety was only outdone by his hatred for Nora's selfishness. His loathing for Nora was even stronger than his desire to see Alvin punished by the law.\nFor Alvin, he just wanted legal justice, but for Nora, he was filled with murderous intent. He knew countless ways to make someone vanish without a trace, ensuring Nora would live the rest of her life in endless regret and pain.\nHe wouldn't let Nora hurt Victoria anymore.\nSensing his determination, Victoria clung to him tighter, her voice trembling with tears, \"Please, don't go!\"\nWilliam narrowed his bloodshot eyes and sneered, \"You're so spineless, not fighting back. Are you just gonna let her keep hurting you?\"\nHe impatiently tried to pry her hands off, but as he glanced down, he saw the needle marks on her arm. The sight of the wounds on her smooth skin ignited his fury even more.\n\"You're such an idiot, putting yourself through this for someone like her!\" He forcefully shook off her hands and stormed out, slamming the door behind him.\n\"William!\"\nVictoria panicked and tried to follow, but she stumbled and fell, hitting her elbow on the corner of the table. The pain made her grimace, and sweat beaded on her forehead.\nShe pulled herself up using the bed for support and chased after him in her slippers.\nNora's room wasn't far.\nAs soon as she reached the hallway, she heard Nora's terrified screams.\nShe saw William dragging Nora by the neck like a ragdoll into the elevator.\nWatching the elevator ascend to the top floor, Victoria's fear peaked.\nIgnoring the pain in her knees, she ran up the stairs like a madwoman.\nWhen she burst through the rooftop door, she saw William standing on the edge, pushing Nora over the railing.\nNora's face was ashen with fear, her hands gripping the metal frame desperately, her head hanging over the edge, ready to fall at any moment.\n\"Help!\" Nora screamed, her voice hoarse with terror. \"Please, let me go!\"\nVictoria, frantic, rushed to the edge and wrapped her arms around Nora's waist, locking her in place.\n\"What are you doing? William, stop this!\"\nWilliam glanced at her coldly, his grip on Nora unrelenting. Nora dangled precariously, ready to drop at any second.\n\"This has nothing to do with you! Get back!\" William's face was twisted with rage. \nHe no longer cared about the law or principles. To him, Nora was no better than a cockroach. How could someone so selfish and vile be worth Victoria sacrificing her health?\nIf it meant keeping Victoria safe, he would make Nora disappear.\nHe couldn't allow anything that threatened Victoria's life, including Nora.\nVictoria gritted her teeth, stubbornly holding onto Nora. \"William, pull her up! Are you out of your mind?\"\nWilliam's eyes were bloodshot, and he barked, \"Let go!\"\n\"No!\" Victoria's eyes reddened with desperation, her voice breaking. \"William, I'm begging you. I'm scared, really scared.\"\nShe cried and pleaded, clinging to him like a drowning person grasping at a lifeline.\nWilliam stared at her face for a long time before finally loosening his grip.\nVictoria, overjoyed, quickly pulled Nora back to safety.\nNora collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath, her voice trembling with fear. \"William! I swear, I won't let this go. I'm calling the police. You'll go to jail!\"\nWilliam looked down at her coldly, squatting beside her, and said slowly, \"You can try. Let's see if I go to jail or if your precious son dies first.\"\nNora's body shook, her eyes wide with shock and fear. She knew William wasn't just making empty threats.\nIf she dared to call the police, William would definitely take her and Bobby out.\nHe was a man who meant what he said.\nNora's face twisted with hatred as she glared at William. \"Fine, I give up!\"\nWith that, she shakily crawled away from the rooftop.\nVictoria sat on the ground, still trembling with fear.\nWilliam knelt beside her, pulling her into a tight embrace, as if trying to merge her with his body. \"I'm sorry I scared you.\"\nHis warm breath brushed her ear, and Victoria's tense body gradually relaxed. She looked up, tears streaming down her face. \"William, I'm not worth you risking yourself.\"\n\"You are worth it,\" he said, his voice hoarse, hiding a deep emotion.\nVictoria stared at him, then suddenly hugged his neck tightly. \"You scared me so much! I was so afraid you'd become a murderer because of me. I was so afraid you'd end up in jail like my dad.\"\n\"Who asked you to do this for me?\" Victoria sobbed against his chest. \"I don't want anything to happen to you. Do you understand?\"\nWilliam's pupils contracted, swallowing her salty tears.\nThe wind blew across the rooftop, and Victoria felt as fragile as glass in his arms.\nWilliam's gaze changed, a fiery emotion welling up inside him, suppressed for too long, now bursting forth.\nHe held her close, his chin resting on her soft hair, gently caressing her pale cheek. \"Don't worry, I won't let anything happen to me.\"\nVictoria looked at him, stunned.\nWilliam cupped her face and kissed her deeply.\nShe closed her eyes, wrapping her arms around his waist, responding to his kiss.\nThey kissed passionately, neither willing to let go, until the door opened.\nHarry saw the scene on the rooftop, paused, and quickly retreated.\nWilliam noticed Victoria's bare feet and sighed, picking her up and carrying her back to the room.\nAs he walked, he gently reminded her, \"Listen to me, give up the idea of donating your kidney to her, okay?\"",

        "content": "Victoria looked up at him, her eyes filled with hesitation. Finally, she softly pleaded, \"William, can you just leave me alone?\"\nWilliam's head snapped down to look at her, his eyes wide with disbelief.\nVictoria jumped off him, her face earnest as she continued, \"Aren't you getting married soon? Stop worrying about me and focus on your big day. My life is my own to handle. You can't protect me forever.\"\nWilliam's brows furrowed as he watched her walk past him with her head down.\nHe quickly stepped forward, blocking her path, his voice tinged with obvious anger, \"What if I insist on being involved?\"\n\"It's my body, my choice. No one gets to decide for me unless you lock me up like those people.\"\nVictoria gently lowered his hand, pushed open the hospital room door, and walked in without looking back.\nWilliam stared at the closed door, knowing full well how stubborn Victoria was. Once she made up her mind, no one could change it.\nFor the first time in his life, William felt powerless. This feeling left him frustrated and without an outlet for his emotions.\nNora was nearly scared to death by William.\nShe could feel that he genuinely wanted to strangle her at that moment.\nWhen had Nora ever suffered such a fate?\nBut that damn William threatened her with Bobby!\nShe couldn't just let it go. She was unwilling to accept it!\nShe thought to herself, even if she couldn't say anything directly, what if someone else spread the word? Then it wouldn't be her fault, right?\nWhen the nurse came to draw her blood for tests, she deliberately cried out in distress, \"I'm as old as his parents, and he bullies me like this. Just because they have money, they think they can do anything! My life is so miserable!\"\nThe doctors and nurses didn't want to get involved, treating her words like a joke, offering a few perfunctory responses before preparing to leave.\nIt was a joke, really. Not to mention that William was a major shareholder in this hospital, everyone knew how Nora treated her biological daughter, Victoria. They had all seen it.\nShe constantly exploited and demanded from Victoria, and now that Victoria was going to give her a kidney, she didn't feel any remorse. Instead, she kept badmouthing Victoria.\nIf it were any other mother, even a foster mother, she wouldn't accept her child's donation, right?\nSo, even though Nora cried her eyes out, the medical staff ignored her, pretending not to hear, completely disregarding her.\n\"You don't understand, he even threatened me! I used to be a respected lady, and he...\"\nThe door suddenly opened.\nVictoria walked in with a dark expression.\nSeeing this, the others quickly finished their tasks and left the room.\nWith no one else around, Nora immediately dropped her pitiful act, replacing it with a look of disdain.\nVictoria closed the door, turned around, and stared at her sharply, \"Shut your mouth! This has nothing to do with William. Don't let me hear you mention him again!\"\nNora squinted her eyes, a mocking smile on her lips, \"You're in love with him.\"\nVictoria's eyelashes trembled slightly as she lowered her gaze, speaking softly, \"That's my business.\"\n\"What a joke. He's got a fiancée and is getting married. Are you planning to keep being his side chick after he ties the knot? How could I have such a shameless daughter? You bring shame to me!\"\nNora's insults grew harsher, her eyes filled with resentment.\nVictoria's face showed a hint of sarcasm as she quietly stared at her, \"You're right. You cheated during marriage and I become a mistress. We truly are mother and daughter.\"\nNora was momentarily speechless.\n\"You!\" Nora gritted her teeth, glaring at her, wishing she could tear her apart.\nVictoria gave her a cold look, \"And don't forget your current situation!\"\nNora's face changed abruptly, glaring at her viciously, \"What, you don't want to donate your kidney anymore? I'll tell your father about you being a mistress. Let's see how you face him then!\"\nShe pointed at Victoria, her emotions out of control, \"William is backing you up, huh? Unless he can protect you for life, you'll never escape my grasp! If you don't donate your kidney today, I'll make your life miserable tomorrow! You hurt my son, I'll destroy you!\"\nShe laughed maniacally, but Victoria's heart was already calm. She turned and walked out.\nThat night, Dr. Myers brought a stack of documents for her to sign, mostly disclaimers about the risks of the surgery, meaning that if anything went wrong, she would bear all the consequences.\nVictoria wasn't a medical professional, but she understood the gist of these terms.\nAfter she signed everything, Dr. Myers sighed and said, \"As a doctor, I have to fulfill my duties, but I sincerely advise you to reconsider. If something goes wrong, who will take care of you? Who can you rely on?\" \nVictoria tightly gripped the papers in her hand, momentarily speechless, unsure of how to respond.\nShe returned to her room, the surgery scheduled for the next morning. Victoria tried to study for her University of Aesthetics Shine entrance exam, but she couldn't focus.\nAt a nightclub, William sat in a corner booth, the table in front of him littered with empty glasses. He had lost count of how much he had drunk.\nDespite the alcohol coursing through his veins, his eyes remained cold, with a hint of fierceness.\nA girl dressed provocatively approached him. \"Hey there, you look like you're having a rough night.\"\nWilliam glanced at her. She wore a tight, short dress that accentuated her curves, her ample chest and slim waist drawing attention.\nVictoria had a similarly graceful figure, but she always wore loose clothing, hiding her body. Only up close could one appreciate the allure beneath her clothes.\nMen naturally have a desire to explore, and William often imagined gently unbuttoning her shirt.\nAs the thought crossed his mind, his eyes turned icy.\nWhat was he thinking?\nWilliam tilted his head back, downing his drink in one gulp. His collar was slightly open, his Adam's apple moving, giving him a rebellious look.\nThis slightly tipsy appearance, with a touch of wildness, was incredibly attractive to the girl.\nSeeing that he didn't respond, she took it as a sign of consent and eagerly sat next to him, her hand reaching for his shoulder.",

        "content": "\"Get lost.\" William's voice dripped with irritation.\nThe girl turned beet red, spat out, \"Jerk, no wonder you got dumped,\" and stormed off in her high heels.\nDumped.\nThat word hit William like a punch to the gut, his face darkening instantly.\nHis buddy, Eugene Bailey, who had tagged along, glanced at him, silently ordered a drink, and slid it over. \"Man, it's rare to see you like this.\"\nWilliam didn't respond, just grabbed the drink and downed it in one go.\nEugene chuckled, \"That's not how you drink, dude. If you really wanna get wasted, go for vodka. One shot and you're out.\"\nWilliam slowly lifted his gaze, giving him a cold stare, \"I came here for some peace and quiet. Why are you yapping so much?\"\nEugene, intrigued, leaned in closer, \"Did you really get dumped? By who? Alice?\"\nHe shook his head, \"Nah, you two seemed solid. Even when you fought before, you never looked this down.\"\nWilliam gave a bitter smile, pushing the glass back towards Eugene.\nEugene raised an eyebrow, \"Now I'm really curious about the woman who could do this to you. Who is she, making you drown your sorrows in booze?\"\nWilliam shot him a look, \"Drop it, can we talk about something else?\"\nEugene paused, then burst into laughter, \"I never thought I'd see the day!\"\nAs his laughter died down, he looked past William and raised a hand in greeting, \"Alice!\"\nWilliam glanced over, his tone indifferent, \"What are you doing here?\"\nAlice, dressed in a pink dress with a light pink cardigan, looked sweet and delicate, the kind of girl who easily evoked a protective instinct in men.\nShe didn't respond, just quietly sat down next to William, gently wrapping her arm around his and resting her head on his shoulder.\nEugene couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, glancing at William with a knowing smile.\nAlice had wrapped her arm around the very spot the other girl had almost touched earlier.\nEveryone in their circle knew about Alice's possessiveness over William.\nOn the surface, she was gentle and harmless, but in reality, her possessiveness was intense. If William so much as spoke to another woman, she'd go crazy, sometimes even doing something drastic.\nJust a few days ago, when she heard that Lyanna had gone to Harborview City with William, she had someone beat Lyanna up and accused her of being a mistress.\nIf William hadn't stepped in to smooth things over, Lyanna's family wouldn't have let it go.\nBut when it didn't involve William, Alice would instantly revert to being the sweet, gentle girl.\nThis stark contrast made everyone marvel at William's charm, that he could make a woman act like this.\nSo, Eugene immediately saw through it. She must have been here the whole time, watching the other girl's every move.\nEugene smartly moved to the other side, not wanting to interrupt the couple.\nWilliam didn't move, letting Alice hold his arm, as he picked up his drink and downed most of it.\n\"William!\" Alice's voice was soft and sweet, \"Have you decided where to go for our honeymoon?\"\nWilliam squinted slightly, slowly turning to look at her.\nShe said, \"I want to go to the beach and see the fireflies.\"\nWilliam finished the rest of his drink in one gulp.\nEugene, sipping his drink, listened intently to the gossip.\nPutting down his glass, William turned, his expression calm, \"I can't make love with you.\"\nEugene nearly spat out his drink, thinking to himself, 'That's blunt. Do I just hear something I shouldn't have?'\nAlice, still leaning on William's arm, stiffened, staying in that position for a long time without moving.\nWilliam's tone was flat and emotionless, \"We've tried, and you know it didn't work.\"\nAlice's face turned pale.\nShe was already delicate, and now she looked even more pitiful, turning to William with a hurt expression that could break anyone's heart.\nBut in William's mind, it was Victoria's face that appeared.\nVictoria, who was always stubborn and strong in the face of adversity, but would cry her heart out because of him when he acted impulsively.\nAt that moment, William felt that he wouldn't have refused if she had asked for his life.\nAlice, her voice trembling, called out softly, \"William!\"\nWilliam looked up at the sound, his gaze falling on her face.\nAlice's eyes were filled with tears, her voice shaking as she reached out and tightly held William's hand, \"I know about you and Victoria. I don't want to hold it against you anymore, and I won't be jealous. Let's just pretend nothing happened and be good to each other, okay?\"\nEugene, watching from the side, couldn't help but frown.\nThey had known each other for years, growing up together. Their bond was deep.\nSeeing Alice so humble and pleading, Eugene felt uncomfortable.\nSo, he stepped forward, casually leaning on the back of the sofa, looking at William, \"William, what's wrong with you today? Can't you talk nicely? Look at how scared Alice is!\"\nWilliam leaned back slightly, lounging on the sofa with an air of lazy elegance, but his eyes were as cold as a winter night, devoid of any warmth.\n\"Because Alice isn't an outsider, I don't want to beat around the bush. It's better for everyone if I'm straightforward.\" William looked up at her.\nHer eyes were red, biting her lip, and after a long pause, she asked, \"Do you love her?\"\nWilliam stared at her for a moment, then suddenly laughed, \"Alice, if I said I love her, would you believe me?\"\nAlice's whole body shook, her face draining of color.\n\"I don't believe you.\" Her voice was filled with deep sorrow, \"You're lying to me!\"\nWilliam dropped his playful attitude, looking at her seriously, \"I'm not lying. I said I love her.\"\nAlice suddenly started laughing softly, her eyes welling up with tears as she wiped them away with a tissue, her voice choked with emotion, \"William, what do all these years of waiting mean then? What about the suffering and depression I endured for you?\"\nWilliam lowered his gaze, staying silent.\nEugene, seeing her like this, felt a bit scared, quickly stepping forward to comfort her, \"Alice, don't get upset. Let's talk this through. William must be joking. Don't take it to heart.\"\nAlice seemed not to hear, her eyes fixed on William, red and seemingly about to bleed, \"I don't care if you're telling the truth or not. I want you to promise me you'll never see her again!\"",

William, don't forget, if it weren't for me, you'd be dead by now!\"\nEugene's brow furrowed deeply.\nThat incident was an unspoken taboo between them.\nAlthough their friends knew the details, no one ever mentioned it in front of them. Alice and William acted as if it had never happened.\nThis was the first time Alice had brought it up.\nAs expected, William pressed his lips tightly together and slowly lowered his gaze.\nAlice laughed, but her laughter was trembling, \"To save you, I was tortured by those bastards for hours!\"\nEugene quickly intervened, \"Alice, stop it, that's enough.\"\nWilliam's eyes began to change, his fists slowly clenching.\nAlice, seemingly unaware, continued, \"Do you know how many times I was violated during those hours?\"\n\"Stop it!\"\nWilliam abruptly cut her off, his knuckles turning white as his fists clenched, veins bulging on the back of his hands.\n\"Why can't I say it?\"\nAlice, having revealed her deepest secret, seemed to relax, a hint of calmness in her expression.\n\"I know you despise me, that's why you won't get close to me. But William, who made me like this? Where's your basic human decency?\"\nWilliam gritted his teeth, his voice squeezed out from between them, \"I never despised you! To me, chastity means nothing!\"\nAlice's laugh was filled with sarcasm, \"Then tell me, why haven't you touched me all these years?\"\nBy the end, her voice was hoarse, almost screaming.\nHer eyes were bloodshot, like a doll that had been cruelly mistreated, pitiful and heart-wrenching.\nWilliam looked at her, his throat tightening, but he couldn't find the words to defend himself.\nEugene, seeing this, became anxious, \"William, say something!\"\nFortunately, the bar's music was deafening, and no one noticed the commotion, thinking it was just a couple having a spat.\nEugene felt stifled listening to it all.\n\"I tried, more than once.\" William had regained his composure, his tone almost indifferent, \"But I just don't feel any sexual desire when I'm with you.\"\nEugene couldn't bear to listen any longer.\nThis situation was beyond help.\nAlice stared at William, devastated. When a man tells you he has no sexual interest in you, it's a hundred times more hurtful than saying \"I don't love you anymore.\"\nAlice felt as if her heart was being torn apart, the pain unbearable.\nThe suffocating feeling made her almost faint, unable to breathe.\nHer eyes filled with tears, she used all her strength to keep them from falling.\nOverwhelmed with resentment and grievance, she just wanted to vent all her emotions.\nShe walked into the nightclub's dance floor.\nUnlike Victoria's casual sexiness, Alice's allure, beneath her fragile exterior, was enough to captivate men, stirring their protective and conquering instincts.\nShe shrugged off her cardigan, flaunting her delicate beauty, quickly attracting a group of men. Gradually, their bodies pressed closer, their hands wandering.\nWilliam kept his back to her.\nEugene frowned, walked over, and nodded towards her, lowering his voice, \"Are you really going to do nothing?\"\nWilliam's brows furrowed, his tone indifferent, \"She's an adult, she should be responsible for herself.\"\nEugene understood, but William's earlier words were too hurtful, especially considering Alice's traumatic past. Leaving her like this could lead to trouble.\n\"You should take her home.\"\nWilliam remained silent for a moment, then downed his last drink, set the glass down, and stood up.\nHe walked straight into the dance floor, coldly pushing away the man who was half-holding Alice, and without a word, dragged her out.\nAlice didn't speak, just looked at William with a mix of longing and sorrow.\nBut the others weren't happy!\n\"Hey! Who said you could leave?\"\nWilliam immediately turned and punched him in the face!\nThe man staggered back, clutching his mouth, cursing, \"Bastard! How dare you hit me! I'll destroy you!\"\nHe swung at William.\nWilliam kicked him in the stomach, sending him and his friend crashing to the ground, crying out in pain.\nThe crowd scattered in panic.\n\"Are you looking for trouble?\" The other men grabbed weapons.\nThe scene was chaotic.\nLuckily, the bar belonged to Eugene, who quickly called security to control the situation.\nOutside the bar, Daisy stood with her arms crossed, her gaze icy.\n\"Causing trouble in a bar, really? William, do you still think you're a kid?\"\nWilliam sat on the steps, a cigarette between his fingers, looking as gloomy as a storm cloud.\nAlice tried to explain, \"It's not his fault, it's mine.\"\n\"Of course it's your fault!\" Daisy turned, her sharp gaze piercing Alice, \"Alice, sometimes I wonder, do you love him, or are you trying to get back at him for what happened?\"\n\"It's not like that, I don't,\" Alice defended herself.\n\"How many fights has William gotten into because of you? Can you honestly say you had no part in it? There are plenty of women in the world, why did those thugs target you, the Garcia family's princess?\"\n\"I didn't, Aunt Daisy, let me explain.\" Alice lowered her head, tears welling up again.\n\"Don't call me Aunt! I don't have a niece like you!\" Daisy's face was full of disdain, \"Don't play the victim with me. I've seen enough over the years! You might fool William, but not me. Get out of here, and if William gets hurt because of you again, I won't let you off!\"\n\"Aunt Daisy!\"\n\"Get out!\"",

        "content": "Daisy cut her off without hesitation.\nAlice was stunned for a moment, and when she looked up, her face was already streaked with tears.\nShe knew Daisy disliked her and was always harsh, but today she was especially severe and resolute.\nBut Daisy was William's aunt, and as a junior, Alice felt it was inappropriate to defy her.\n\"Enough.\"\nWilliam stubbed out his cigarette and looked up at Daisy. \"I'm tired. Can I go home now?\"\nDaisy glanced at Alice, then turned and opened the car door.\nWilliam stood up and gave Alice a look. \"Harry will take you home.\"\n\"Okay!\" Alice, as obedient as a kitten, acted as if nothing had happened.\nShe stepped forward and took his hand, noticing the scrapes on his knuckles. She leaned in and gently kissed them. \"We still have to prepare for the wedding in a few days. Go home and get some rest.\"\nWilliam looked at her and nodded. \"Okay.\"\nIn the car, Daisy turned her face away, thinking 'out of sight, out of mind.'\nOnce William got in, Daisy floored the gas pedal, and the car sped off.\nDaisy's voice was cold and hard as she drove. \"Are you really going to marry her?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"What about Victoria?\"\nWilliam turned his head to look out the window. \"What does she have to do with this?\"\n\"How long are you going to keep pretending?\" Daisy was tired of his games and got straight to the point. \"Don't tell me you don't like her. If you didn't, why would you drag me all the way here? Why would you make me save the person you hate the most?\"\nWilliam frowned, clearly annoyed. \"Why are you saying so much? Did you get it done or not?\"\nDaisy didn't respond immediately. She turned the steering wheel and parked the car under a streetlight. Then she turned and smacked him on the head. \"What kind of attitude is that? Who do you think I am? You're getting pretty bold. Are you looking for trouble?\"\nWilliam was both angry and helpless. Daisy hit hard, and his head throbbed with pain, but he couldn't fight back. He could only grab her wrist and say, \"Alright, alright, I was wrong. It's my fault.\"\nDaisy finally let him go, leaned back in her seat, and lit a cigarette. The smoke blurred her features as she narrowed her beautiful eyes and said slowly, \"It's all taken care of.\"\nHearing this, William sighed in relief. \"Thank you, Aunt Daisy.\"\nDaisy gave him a sidelong glance, half-smiling. \"Don't thank me just yet. I'm warning you, figure out what you really want. Don't wait until it's too late to regret it.\"\n\"I know what I'm doing,\" William said.\nDaisy snorted. \"If you really knew, you wouldn't have done something so stupid tonight!\"\nWilliam pressed his lips together and said nothing.\n\"Forget it. Talking to you is pointless. You never listen anyway.\" Daisy put out her cigarette and started the car again.\nElara arrived at the hospital at the crack of dawn.\nShe carried a bulging bag filled with various essentials for Victoria.\nSeeing Elara's worried expression, Victoria tried to cheer her up with a smile. \"Elara, look on the bright side. Now I can finally take a break! No need to rush to work, no deadlines for my design drafts, and no dealing with difficult clients. Plus, I can study for the University of Aesthetics Shine entrance exam!\"\nWith a loud thud, Elara slammed her thermos on the table and turned to glare at Victoria. \"There's nothing good about it! You shouldn't do this surgery, giving your kidney to that heartless mother!\"\nThe more Elara thought about it, the more upset she became. She tried to reason with Victoria. \"Victoria, you're only twenty. Your life is just beginning. Without a healthy body, how will you work and strive for your future? And what if you meet someone you truly love? You can't expect them to deal with your health issues. They deserve a healthy partner. What if something happens to you? What will your loved one do then?\"\nVictoria listened quietly. She understood Elara's points, but she couldn't give up on what she believed to be right because of uncertain future concerns.\nShe knew it might not be the wisest choice, but to her, it was the only choice.\n\"Elara, I can't think that far ahead. I just believe that there are many ways to live, and there's no absolute right way. The best way is the one that feels right to you.\"\nHearing this, Elara realized that no matter how much she tried to persuade her, Victoria wouldn't change her mind.\nShe could only sigh and wipe away her tears.\nSoon, Dr. Myers came in for the final pre-surgery check.\n\"Are you ready? It's almost time to go to the operating room.\"\n\"Yes.\" Victoria's expression was calm.\n\"Don't worry. The risk for you is relatively low. Just trust us.\" Dr. Myers gave a few more routine instructions before leaving.\nAt that moment, there was a soft knock on the door.\nVictoria was half-leaning on the bed, clutching her phone, deep in thought.\nShe knew she would soon be wheeled into the operating room. Despite the doctors' reassurances, she was well aware that surgery always carried risks, and she felt a bit anxious.\nRight now, she just wanted to talk to someone, to say some final words.\nBut she didn't know who to contact or where to start.\nHer fingers hovered over a name in her contacts, unable to move.\nSuddenly, she snapped out of it, as if burned, and quickly tossed her phone aside.\nJust then, the door to the room opened, and a figure appeared in the doorway.\n\"Sir, who are you looking for?\" Elara asked, stepping forward. Victoria instinctively looked up.\nBut before she could speak, she froze.\nShe stared in shock at the man who walked in, her mouth slightly open, eyes wide as if she had seen something unbelievable.\nElara was about to stop the man, but seeing Victoria's reaction, she realized they must know each other. She asked softly, \"Victoria, who is he?\"\nVictoria's eyes filled with tears instantly.\nIgnoring everything, she threw off the covers, stepped barefoot onto the floor, and stumbled forward with open arms, her voice trembling as she cried out, \"Dad!\"",

        "content": "Alvin stood still, letting Victoria collapse into his arms.\nVictoria was trembling with sobs, clutching Alvin's waist and burying her head in his chest. \"Dad, is it really you? Am I dreaming?\" she choked out.\nShe was terrified that everything in front of her was just an illusion.\nHer emotions were a whirlwind, and tears streamed down her face like a broken string of pearls.\nAlvin gently patted Victoria's back, soothing her in a low voice, \"Silly girl. I'm here. This isn't a dream. I'm back. Don't cry.\"\n\"Dad! Dad!\" Victoria cried even harder, gripping Alvin's shirt tightly, filled with deep-seated grievance and dependence. \"Dad, I missed you so much. I've been waiting for you to come back every single day, for so long.\"\nVictoria was a mess of tears, and Alvin's heart ached for her. He could only keep comforting her, \"I'm so sorry, Victoria. It's all my fault. You've been through so much.\"\nElara stood nearby, her mouth agape in shock. She never expected that the man in front of her was actually Victoria's father-the one who was supposed to be in prison.\nOutside the hospital room, Daisy paused, glancing back down the empty hallway.\nAround the corner, William leaned against the wall, a lit cigarette between his fingers.\nHe looked down, watching the smoke curl around his fingers, his handsome, aloof face partially hidden in the haze.\nHe had never heard Victoria cry so heartbreakingly before. Her sobs were filled with endless grievance, like a lost child, stubborn yet full of despair.\nIt was as if she had been struggling alone for so long, and only now, seeing her family, could she finally let down her guard and cry her heart out.\nWilliam's heart twisted painfully.\nInside the room, Victoria's emotions were completely out of control.\nAll the grievances and sadness she had suppressed for so long burst forth like a flood.\nShe clung to Alvin's shoulder, sobbing uncontrollably.\nAlvin held Victoria's thin, frail body, his heart aching. \"Victoria, it's all my fault. I've made you suffer so much. I'm sorry.\"\n\"No, Dad, don't say that. It's not your fault. You had no choice,\" Victoria shook her head, her voice hoarse.\n\"Victoria!\" Alvin reached out a trembling hand, gently stroking her soft, short hair.\n\"Dad, tell me, you won't leave me again, right?\"\nVictoria suddenly looked up, her tear-filled eyes gazing at Alvin.\n\"Don't worry. He's been released on parole. As long as he behaves, he won't have to go back,\" Daisy said calmly as she entered the room.\nAlvin turned his head, looking at Daisy with gratitude in his eyes.\nDaisy, however, didn't spare him a glance, walking straight to Victoria.\nVictoria quickly wiped the tears from her cheeks and stood up. \"Thank you, Ms. Scott. Thank you for saving my dad.\"\nDaisy smiled and shook her head. \"Don't thank me. You should know who helped you and why he got your dad out.\"\nVictoria fell silent, her heart pounding.\nShe knew exactly who had helped her get Alvin out.\nShe never expected he would go this far for her.\nAlvin's face darkened at Daisy's words.\nHe grabbed Victoria's wrist. \"Let's go home.\"\nThat simple phrase, \"Let's go home,\" was like a key, unlocking the softest part of Victoria's heart.\nVictoria couldn't hold back any longer. Tears streamed down her face as she clutched Alvin's hand, nodding vigorously. \"Yeah, let's go home.\"\nThat word \"home\" carried all her hopes and dreams for so many days and nights.\nOf all the words in the world, only \"home\" could touch the deepest part of her soul and warm her heart.\nAlvin smiled with relief, pulling Victoria towards the door.\nBefore Victoria could respond, they heard hurried footsteps outside, and then Nora burst in.\n\"Why are you crying so miserably before surgery? Are you that eager for me to die?\" She pushed the door open and froze when she saw the people inside.\nHearing her voice, Alvin's brow furrowed, his expression growing darker.\nHe pulled Victoria towards the door.\nNora was too shocked to speak, shaking her head in disbelief. \"Alvin, how did you get out? What's going on?\"\nThe Alvin in front of her, after two years in prison, looked much more rugged but still had those sharp features. The resilience in his eyes was even stronger, and he looked spirited, not at all like a worn-out prisoner.\nIn fact, he looked even more rugged and strong, making it hard to look away.\nMaybe it was because they had been apart for two years, but at that moment, Nora felt a strange flutter for the man she once despised.\nNora smoothed her disheveled hair and straightened her hospital gown, trying to present herself better. \"Alvin, now that you're here, don't you have anything to say to me?\"\nAlvin's eyes flashed, and he tightened his grip on Victoria's hand. \"I have nothing to say to you.\"\nWith that, he pulled Victoria and walked quickly towards the door.\nNora panicked and rushed to block their way. \"Wait! Victoria can't leave!\"\nAlvin stopped and turned to her. \"What, do I need your permission to take my daughter home? Move!\"\n\"No!\" Nora, standing in front of him, still had a hint of coquettishness, as if she still lived in the past, thinking Alvin was the man who would do anything for her.\nShe pointed at Victoria, her arrogance returning. \"Victoria, what's wrong with you? Are you going to let me die here?\"\nAlvin's long-suppressed anger exploded. He let go of Victoria's hand and grabbed Nora by the throat.\nNora was completely caught off guard, both shocked and furious, glaring at him. \"Are you crazy?\"\nJust days ago, she had clashed with William, and the bruises on her neck hadn't even faded. Now, Alvin's grip made her cry out in pain.\nElara and Daisy rushed over to pull Alvin away.\nAlvin's eyes were bloodshot, his voice low and hoarse. \"The biggest regret of my life is not divorcing you when I found out you were cheating, letting Victoria suffer under your hands for so many years. When I was home, you at least held back a little. But once I was in prison, what did you do to her!\"\nThinking about what Daisy had told him, about the things Bobby and Nora had done to Victoria over the past two years, Alvin wanted to tear them apart.\nHis precious Victoria, so well-behaved and sensible, had been bullied by Bobby and Nora.\nThe more he thought about it, the angrier he got. His eyes were bloodshot, and he tightened his grip on Nora's neck. \"And you want her to donate a kidney to you? No way! I won't let you harm my daughter anymore!\"",

        "content": "Nora struggled to pry Alvin's large hands off her neck, desperately slapping his chest, her face turning purple. \"Let go, let go!\"\nVictoria, terrified by Alvin's demeanor, rushed over and hugged his waist, shouting, \"Dad! Let go! Please, let go!\"\nDaisy, standing nearby, tried to reason with him. \"Alvin, calm down. I worked so hard to get you out. Do you want to be locked up again and leave Victoria without her father's protection?\"\nHearing this, Alvin's arms stiffened.\nHe slowly released his grip.\nNora collapsed to the floor, clutching her throat and gasping for air, trembling all over.\nShe could feel that Alvin had genuinely wanted to kill her just now.\nShe used to think Alvin was weak and easy to manipulate, but now she realized he could be more ruthless than anyone.\nAlvin was completely different now.\nNora looked at Alvin's more rugged and masculine face, her heart pounding.\nDespite her fear, an inexplicable thrill crept into her heart.\nThe commotion was so loud that doctors and nurses rushed over.\n\"What happened?\"\nDr. Myers asked as he approached, but Alvin stepped forward, his tone somewhat restrained. \"I'm Victoria's father.\"\nDr. Myers was slightly taken aback, having heard a bit about Alvin's situation.\nHe hadn't expected Alvin to be released.\n\"My daughter won't be having this surgery.\"\nDr. Myers looked troubled and turned to Victoria, speaking gently. \"Ms. Carter is an adult. The final decision about the surgery is hers.\"\nNora panicked upon hearing this. If Victoria didn't donate her kidney, she would be left to die.\nThat couldn't happen.\nBut having just been threatened by Alvin, she didn't dare act out again. Instead, she pitifully pleaded with Victoria, \"Victoria, you're the kindest child. If you don't help me, I'll die.\"\nShe cried as she spoke, looking pitiful.\nElara, seeing this, grew increasingly agitated. As an outsider, she shouldn't have said anything. But she had seen how much Victoria had suffered over the past two years.\nShe knew how harsh Nora had been to Victoria, so she couldn't help but speak up for her. \"Nora, we're both mothers. Can you honestly say you deserve to be called a mother?\"\nNora glared at her angrily. \"Who do you think you are to lecture me?\"\nElara scoffed, not backing down. \"Do you think I want to waste my breath on someone like you? I may not be related to Victoria by blood, but I've seen how hard she's worked. She scrimps and saves, working long hours to support herself and you and your son, while you live comfortably. And what do you do? You only care about your son and treat Victoria like a cash cow. Do you think no one knows what you've done?\"\nElara paused, then continued, \"The things you and your son have done are shameful. How could a mother and brother do such things?\"\n\"That's nonsense!\" Nora was furious. \"You wretch, stop slandering me! I've never wronged Victoria!\"\n\"Never wronged her? Who falsely accused Victoria of plagiarism? Who claimed she used unethical means to get into Starry Studio Gallery? Who lured her to an abandoned factory for money, nearly getting her killed?\" Elara's anger grew. \"And now, you and your illegitimate son have imprisoned and beaten Victoria for money! And you still dare to ask her for a kidney? You're shameless! People like you don't deserve to live!\"\n\"Shut up!\" Nora screamed. \"You wretch, I'll tear your mouth apart!\"\n\"Bring it on, I'm not afraid of you!\" Elara rolled up her sleeves, ready to fight.\nShe had long been fed up with Nora.\nVictoria was such a good, obedient child. But she had the misfortune of having an unreliable mother, suffering for years.\nElara had been waiting for a chance to deal with Nora.\nToday was the perfect opportunity!\nShe was determined to teach Nora a lesson!\nVictoria watched in shock as the usually gentle Elara grabbed Nora's clothes, ready to fight.\nShe was stunned for a moment, then quickly ran over to break it up.\n\"Elara, Elara, don't do this. It's not worth it.\" Victoria hugged Elara's waist, stopping her from acting impulsively.\nElara struggled. \"Victoria, let go. I need to teach her a lesson! This vile woman deserves to be cut to pieces!\"\nVictoria was deeply moved.\nShe knew Elara cared for her.\nBut she hadn't realized Elara remembered all her suffering and pain so clearly.\nNot her biological mother, but better than one.\nVictoria's eyes welled up with tears. She hugged Elara tightly, choking up. \"Elara, calm down. Don't hurt yourself over someone not worth it.\"\nElara felt a warm surge in her heart. She patted Victoria's head. \"Good girl, I'm fine. This wicked woman will get her comeuppance eventually.\"\nAlvin had only heard a bit from Daisy, but he hadn't realized Nora had done so much to abuse Victoria. He was furious.\nHe gritted his teeth, yanked Nora away, and slapped her hard.\nThe slap echoed loudly.\nNora was stunned, unable to react for a moment.\n\"You... you hit me?\" She stared at Alvin in shock, unable to believe her eyes.\nOne slap wasn't enough for Alvin. He raised his leg, ready to kick her.\nHe wanted to kill this vile Nora!\nDaisy quickly intervened, stopping Alvin.\nShe frowned and scolded him softly. \"Enough, calm down.\"\nVictoria also hurried to calm him. \"Dad, I'm fine, really.\"\n\"Fine? You call this fine?\"\nAlvin looked at Victoria with a trembling voice, full of pain.\nHe glared at Nora, pointing at her. \"If you dare ask for Victoria's kidney, I'll kill you. An eye for an eye.\"\nNora, pale with fear, tried to call out sweetly, \"Alvin!\"\nDaisy snapped impatiently, \"Shut up!\"\nVictoria's heart tightened. She had finally gotten Alvin back and didn't want to lose him again. She quickly said, \"No donation, no surgery. I'm not doing it!\"",

        "content": "Nora didn't dare make a sound. After living with Alvin for so many years, she knew his temperament well. He might seem gentle and polite on the surface, but deep down, he was incredibly stubborn. Once he made up his mind, no one could change it.\nBut Nora was quick-witted. She desperately needed Victoria's kidney to save her life and couldn't afford to mess things up now. She couldn't anger Victoria, nor could she offend Alvin.\n\"Alright, we won't do it. I know it's unfair to Victoria. She's still young and shouldn't have to make such a big sacrifice for me.\"\nShe even bowed slightly to Dr. Myers, apologizing proactively, \"Dr. Myers, I'm really sorry for all the trouble I've caused you and the hospital.\"\nDr. Myers visibly relaxed, and perhaps it was just her imagination, but it seemed like the corners of his mouth lifted slightly.\nHe responded kindly, \"It's alright. We always follow the patient's wishes. Your decision is respected.\"\nDaisy glanced at Nora with a look full of mockery and stepped forward, \"Dr. Myers, I'll go handle the paperwork with you. I'll cover all the costs.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nAfter the two left, Elara happily started packing up. \"Victoria, go home and rest with your dad. I'll take care of things here.\"\n\"Elara, thank you!\"\n\"Don't mention it! Just go home already!\"\nVictoria was eager to spend some time alone with Alvin. She had so many questions and wanted to know how he had been all these years in prison.\n\"Dad, wait for me. I'll change my clothes.\"\n\"Okay.\" Alvin walked outside the ward to wait.\nNora stood to the side, looking as if she had been wronged.\nAlvin, now in his prime, stood tall and strong, with broad shoulders, a narrow waist, and straight, powerful legs.\nNora's heart suddenly raced, especially realizing that this was the man who had been by her side for so many years.\nHer feelings for Alvin had been like still water, lifeless and unmoving. But now, it was as if a pebble had been tossed in, sending ripples across the surface.\n\"Alvin,\" she called softly, her voice gentle and melodious, reminiscent of the times they were intimate, her whispers filled with emotion.\nAlvin stood still, not even sparing her a glance.\nThe love he once felt so strongly for this woman had been chipped away by too many disappointments and hurts.\nDuring his days of imprisonment, he had reflected deeply on the past.\nNora had never truly loved him, and Alvin had known this for a long time.\nThrough the years they had spent together, Alvin had gone from being full of hope and naivety to feeling utterly exhausted and scarred. \nHe had given his all to this relationship and this family, with a clear conscience. He had offered his most passionate and pure feelings without reservation. \nBut unfortunately, Nora had never cherished them, treating them like trash.\n\"Alvin?\" Nora cautiously approached. Without the boost of high heels, the height difference between them was even more pronounced, making her look more fragile.\nShe looked up, her eyes greedily scanning Alvin's chiseled face, then slowly moving down to his firm chest. Her heartbeat quickened, as if she were a young girl again, experiencing her first crush.\nRealizing her loss of composure, she shyly lowered her head, her voice becoming even softer, \"Please don't be mad at me about Victoria, okay? I know I've been a terrible mother, not fulfilling my responsibilities. But you have to understand. Ever since you were taken in, I've been living in constant depression.\"\n\"Yet you seem to be taking care of Bobby just fine.\" Alvin's eyes were cold, devoid of any warmth.\nNora's face turned awkward, and she mumbled softly, \"Don't listen to others. It's not like that. Bobby has been taking care of me.\"\n\"In that case, let him donate his kidney to you.\"\n\"That's impossible!\" Nora's reaction was intense, blurting out without thinking.\nAlvin didn't argue, just continued to look at her coldly, his gaze seemingly able to pierce through her.\n\"Alvin, please don't misunderstand. Bobby's kidney isn't a match for me. He wants to help, but he can't.\"\nAt that moment, Daisy walked in. Seeing her, Nora immediately fell silent.\nShe recognized Daisy. Back then, Daisy was only twenty, with a cold and aloof personality, always sitting alone at gatherings, not getting close to anyone.\nNow, Daisy exuded the charm of a mature woman in her forties, showcasing her feminine allure to the fullest.\nNora couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy.\nDaisy walked past her and directly asked Alvin, \"Where's Victoria?\"\n\"She's changing inside.\"\nDaisy walked in, \"Victoria, are you ready to go?\"\n\"Yes, I'm ready.\" Victoria came out, gave Elara a few instructions, then, like when she was a child, affectionately linked her arm with Alvin's, her face beaming with happiness.\n\"Let's go.\" Alvin's eyes were full of love as he led Victoria out of the room.\nNeither of them looked at Nora even once.\n\"Alvin, Victoria.\" Nora tried to catch up, but Daisy quickly blocked her path, and said calmly, \"Nora, Dr. Myers mentioned that you still need to stay in the hospital for observation.\"\n\"But...\"\nDaisy cut her off, \"If you can ask Victoria to donate a kidney to you, then you must know better than I do that nothing beats your own health, right?\"\nNora was full of displeasure but had to hold it in, saying nothing.\nDaisy was right. At the moment, nothing was more important than getting her health back on track.\nAlvin stood in front of the villa, lost in thought.\nHe turned his head to look at Daisy, \"Did he help you get this place?\"\nDaisy nodded slightly, not saying much.\nAlvin understood that some topics, once opened, would only complicate things further, benefiting no one, especially regarding why William went to such lengths.\nDaisy turned to leave.\n\"I'll walk you out.\" Alvin grabbed his coat and led the way.\nDaisy watched his back and slowly followed.\nThey walked out the gate, strolling along the path in the neighborhood.\nThis villa area, though not as luxurious as the top-tier neighborhoods the Carter family used to live in, was still home to many elites. The location was excellent, and the environment was serene and peaceful.\nDaisy broke the silence first, \"Remember the last time you walked me home? I was about Victoria's age.\"\nAt twenty, a girl harbors so many innocent secrets.\nAlvin kept his hands in his pockets, not responding, his head slightly lowered, lost in thought.\nDaisy wasn't one to dwell on the past for long. She quickly set aside those memories and asked, \"What are your plans now that you're back?\"\nAlvin lifted his head, his gaze firm, \"Find a job and make money to support Victoria.\"\nHe vowed never to let Victoria suffer any more.\nDaisy nodded, \"If you need any help, just let me know.\"\n\"You've already helped me a lot. Now that I'm back, I need to walk my own path.\"\nDaisy stopped, looking at him with a cold expression, \"Do you have to be so distant with me?\"\nAlvin looked at her deeply, \"I know you've helped me a lot, and I remember it all. I'll repay you someday.\"\n\"Do you think I helped you to get something in return?\"\nAlvin was silent for a moment, then said, \"Can you pass a message to William for me?\"\nDaisy was slightly taken aback, having a vague idea of what he wanted to say.\n\"If he has any grudges, he can come after me. Even if he wants my life, I won't flinch. But please, stay away from Victoria. It's best if he never appears in her life again.\"",

        "content": "Alvin's eyes were cold and determined. \"I'd do anything for Victoria.\"\nDaisy pursed her lips and spoke slowly, \"Have you ever thought that maybe he...\"\n\"It doesn't matter. Victoria doesn't need it. Your family are too complicated. I've been through enough, and I can't let Victoria be in danger again.\"\nDaisy stared at him for a long time, sighed, and then turned to leave.\nAlvin watched her disappear through the front door before turning back inside.\nWhen he got home, Victoria was sitting on the living room couch, hugging her knees and staring off into space. Hearing the door open, she turned her head towards the stairs.\nSeeing it was him, her previously dull expression instantly brightened.\n\"Dad!\" she exclaimed, rushing over to hug Alvin's arm.\nAlvin affectionately ruffled her hair. \"What do you want to eat? I'll make it for you.\"\n\"I want your fried fish and fried chicken.\"\n\"Alright, I'll go get the groceries now,\" Alvin agreed with a smile.\nEven though he used to be very busy with work, whenever he had free time, he would dive into the kitchen to cook for the family.\nAlvin and Victoria chatted and laughed as they wandered through the supermarket, picking out the freshest ingredients.\nBack home, Victoria eagerly helped wash and chop the vegetables.\nSeeing how skilled she had become, Alvin realized that his once-cherished daughter must have endured a lot over the past two years.\nThe thought made his heart ache.\nHe reached out and gently touched Victoria's forehead, speaking softly, \"I promise, I won't let anyone hurt you again.\"\nVictoria's nose tingled, and she choked up, \"It's okay, Dad. I've grown up. I can take care of myself.\"\nAlvin patted her shoulder lovingly. \"Silly girl, you'll always be my little girl.\"\nVictoria sniffled and lowered her head to continue washing the vegetables.\nOnly in front of Alvin could she be the carefree little princess she once was.\nBy the time dinner was ready, it was dusk. The setting sun cast a golden glow inside the house, warm and peaceful.\nAlvin and Victoria chatted as they ate.\nVictoria excitedly shared stories about her job at Starry Studio Gallery and her upcoming entrance exam for the University of Aesthetics Shine.\nAlvin listened quietly, occasionally chiming in, his eyes full of love.\nBut soon, Alvin's expression turned serious as he remembered something.\nHe didn't want to spoil the moment with harsh words, but he had to remind her, \"Victoria, you need to stop seeing William.\"\nVictoria paused, looking up at Alvin. \"Why bring him up now?\"\nAlvin frowned slightly, noticing her mood drop, and felt a pang of worry. \"Victoria, I'm not trying to ruin your mood, but William's family is too complicated. We can't afford to get involved with them, do you understand?\"\nVictoria's face fell, and she lowered her head, speaking softly, \"Dad, you don't need to worry. William is getting married soon. There's nothing between us. Besides, I have a boyfriend now. His name is Samuel. I'll bring him to meet you someday.\"\nAlvin sighed and patted her shoulder. \"Alright, I trust you. When you have time, bring him over so I can meet him.\"\nVictoria nodded and started clearing the table. As she turned away from Alvin, a tear fell silently.\nAlvin had started his own business again. He was once the most renowned architect in Crystalia, but after two years in prison, his old connections were gone.\nHe needed to readjust to society after being away for over two years.\nBut he had built his career from scratch before and had real talent. He believed that with time, he could succeed again.\nDespite his busy schedule, Alvin still made sure to cook three meals a day for Victoria.\nVictoria felt sorry for Alvin but couldn't stop him. She knew that if he didn't get out there and try, he would be even more miserable.\nVictoria was very considerate and never disturbed Alvin unnecessarily. She returned to Starry Studio Gallery and quickly got back into the swing of things. She diligently organized artwork, greeted clients, and tried to keep her life busy.\nWhenever she had time, she visited Samuel in the hospital. Samuel was happy for Victoria when he heard Alvin had been released on bail. Victoria occasionally talked to him about Alvin. Samuel always listened patiently and offered advice and encouragement.\n\"Your dad's amazing. With his determination and courage, he'll definitely succeed. If he doesn't mind, I can introduce him to some resources.\"\nSamuel was a respected figure in the art world, and his connections could greatly help Alvin. Although Victoria was tempted, she shook her head and declined his offer.\n\"Thanks, but I think my dad would prefer to achieve his goals on his own. I believe in him.\"\nBesides, Victoria didn't want to trouble Samuel too much. \nSamuel was momentarily surprised but then smiled. \"Too bad, I won't get a chance to impress my future father-in-law.\"\nVictoria blushed and glared at him. \"Stop talking nonsense.\"\n\"Alright, alright, my bad,\" Samuel surrendered with a smile. \"I'll be discharged in a few days. You should introduce me to your dad then, right?\"\nVictoria paused while cutting an apple for him. She hesitated for a moment but finally nodded. \"Okay, once my dad is less busy, I'll bring you home to meet him.\"\nSamuel beamed. \"Great, I'll be waiting for your call.\"\nAfter leaving the hospital, Victoria went back to her old apartment. She still had some things to pack up. Today, she had some free time to go and get them.\nWhen she unlocked the familiar door, a strong smell of alcohol hit her. The room was dim, with the curtains tightly closed. Only a few slivers of light seeped through the gaps, casting shadows on the messy room. Empty bottles were scattered all over the floor, and there were many unopened ones too. The ashtray was overflowing with cigarette butts.\nWilliam was passed out drunk on the cold tile floor, muttering \"Victoria\" in his sleep. His eyes were half-closed, his long lashes casting shadows on his cheeks. His flushed face made his handsome features even more striking.\nVictoria stood at the door, staring for a long time, her heart aching. She slowly walked over, knelt down, and with trembling fingers, gently touched William's face. Her fingertips brushed his lips, feeling the warmth and moisture. She lightly touched his throat but quickly pulled back, as if scared, her breathing quickening.\nThey hadn't seen each other for over two weeks since their last meeting on the hospital rooftop. But she knew he had been silently protecting her all along. Including Alvin's release on bail, which must have cost William a lot.\nVictoria's eyes reddened. She didn't want to hurt him. But she had no other choice but to push him away. There were too many obstacles between them, too deep to overcome.\nHer eyes suddenly stung, as if pricked by needles. She blinked rapidly to push back the tears. Then she bent down, trying to lift William onto the couch. \nIt was still early spring, and the floor was cold. Lying there all night would make him sick.\nBut as soon as she exerted force, William rolled over and pinned her down!",

She tried to push him away again, but William was like a block of iron, completely immovable.\n\"You really are drunk, let go of me,\" Victoria was at a loss, \"I'll take you to the hospital, do you have any sobering medicine?\"\nWilliam didn't respond but suddenly leaned in to kiss her.\nVictoria was caught off guard, her whole body stiffening.\nWilliam's tongue forcefully pried open her lips, greedily plundering the sweetness of her mouth.\nVictoria pushed him with all her might, but he only held her tighter.\nWilliam's body was heavy, and she used all her strength just to support him.\nHis lips were hot, scorching, and searing, attacking her with a storm-like intensity.\nVictoria was kissed breathless, struggling desperately, but William gave her no chance to escape.\nWilliam's breathing grew heavier.\nHis large hand gripped her slender waist, holding her tightly, his warm hand caressing her smooth skin, making her shiver uncontrollably.\nHis hand moved upward, covering her full, soft breast.\nVictoria felt a jolt of electricity run through her body, making her feel incredibly tingly.\nShe used the last of her rationality to resist the surging sensation.\n\"William, wake up, please wake up, don't do this to me,\" her voice quickened, almost pleading.\nBut William ignored her.\nThe alcohol had numbed his senses, he couldn't remember anything, the only thing he knew was that the woman beneath him was Victoria, the woman he loved most.\nHe grabbed Victoria's neck, forcing her disheveled self to look at him.\nVictoria's makeup was half-smeared, her lipstick smudged on William's hand, which he slowly licked off.\nA bit of red stained his tongue, like blood that hadn't fully faded.\n\"Victoria, I love you, you are mine,\" William suddenly said, flipping Victoria over so she was lying face down on the couch.\nThen he tore off her silk panties, and without any foreplay, he thrust into her.\nWilliam let out a satisfied groan, grabbing Victoria's chin to force her to turn her head and kiss him, filling her mouth with his.\nVictoria could clearly feel William's hot, hard presence moving inside her, pushing slowly but irresistibly.\n\"William, you can't!\" Victoria screamed, but how could she push away a drunk man?\nWilliam's penis was thick and long, reaching her cervix, the pleasure too intense for her to focus.\nWilliam paused, then lightened his movements.\nEven so, Victoria couldn't take it, biting her lip and gripping his arms tightly to suppress the pleasure coursing through her body.\nVictoria's soft moans, mixed with William's low growls, filled the large room with an intimate, charged atmosphere.\nPinned beneath him, her legs raised and pressed tightly against William's hips, every inch of her skin, every sensitive spot, even every cell was teased by William, making her moan uncontrollably.\nHer body trembled involuntarily, her cheeks flushed with a thin layer of sweat, her forehead beaded with perspiration.\nHer breathing grew more erratic, her chest heaving, her body trembling with emotion.\nThe places where they were tightly connected grew hotter, like being roasted over a fire, pushing Victoria to the brink of collapse.\nShe moaned softly, the position making her feel especially embarrassed, her dress hanging loosely, and William's thrusts going deeper because of it.\nShe could feel the deepest part of her being repeatedly hit, a thin membrane that William surely knew how to break through.\nShe endured the intense pleasure, digging her fingers into his shoulders.\n\"Victoria, be good, bear with it, it'll be over soon,\" William whispered in her ear, soothing her anxiety and fear like a child.\nThen, without warning, he pushed through the membrane, like an unstoppable blade, piercing the deepest softness in Victoria.\nVictoria screamed, her body convulsing as if electrocuted, her vaginal walls contracting, muscles tightening. William closed his eyes and groaned, pressing Victoria's head down to kiss her.\nHe came!\nWilliam lay on top of Victoria, motionless.\nVictoria, however, was breathing heavily, her chest heaving from the exertion. She wanted to push him away, but he was too heavy, and she had no strength left.\nWilliam opened his eyes, his deep gaze fixed on Victoria, filled with an overwhelming affection and adoration.\nVictoria's face turned bright red, too embarrassed to look at William.\nWilliam smiled and kissed her, savoring her like the most delicious food.\nHis kisses trailed from her lips to her cheeks and neck, leaving a trail of wet marks.\n\"William, stop pretending. I know you're sober,\" Victoria huffed, her voice soft and sweet.\nWilliam stopped all his actions.\nVictoria seized the moment, sitting up and hurriedly picking up her clothes to put them on.\nAfter being tormented by William for so long, her whole body ached, and she could barely stand, leaning against the couch for support.\nSeeing this, William quickly reached out to help her.\n\"What are you doing!\" Victoria glared at him.\n\"Victoria, let me help you dress,\" William's voice was hoarse, his gaze fixed on her chest.\n\"Who needs your help? Get away, I'll do it myself.\" Victoria swatted his hand away and started dressing herself.\nWilliam didn't stop her, his eyes still locked on her chest.\nVictoria kept her head down, tying her belt, feeling William's unwavering gaze on her.\nHer heart started racing again.\nVictoria didn't dare look up. Once she was dressed and ready to head to the door, she was pulled back by a strong force.\nWilliam held her, leaning in to kiss her.\nTheir lips intertwined, moving together.\nVictoria's heart pounded like a drum, and she tried to push him away.\nBut William only held her tighter.\n\"Victoria, stay a little longer.\" His breath brushed her cheek, whispering softly.\nVictoria was stunned for a moment, about to speak when a knock sounded at the door.",

She quickly tidied her messy hair before slowly opening the door.\nThe moment the door opened, she felt like she had fallen into an ice-cold abyss. Standing there were her father, Alvin, and Alice, whose eyes were filled with venom.\nVictoria's mind buzzed. How did they find this place?\n\"Dad!\" Victoria called out, and at the same time, William heard her. His movements froze for a second.\nAlvin shot Victoria a cold glance and walked straight into the room.\nHis eyes scanned the room, taking in William's disheveled appearance and Victoria's flushed cheeks. He instantly understood what had happened.\nHis face darkened with rage, and without a word, he swung his fist at William.\nWilliam didn't dodge, taking the punch squarely. Blood immediately trickled from the corner of his mouth.\n\"Dad!\" Victoria screamed, rushing to shield William.\nAlvin, as if he hadn't heard her, continued his assault, delivering a brutal kick to William's stomach.\nWilliam clutched his stomach and fell to his knees.\nVictoria burst into tears. \"Dad, please stop! Don't hit him anymore. It's my fault. If you want to blame someone, blame me. It has nothing to do with him.\"\nAlice, seeing William being beaten, hurried over to help him.\n\"William, are you okay?\" Alice asked worriedly.\n\"Get lost,\" William snapped coldly. \"I don't need your fake concern.\"\n\"How can you say that? How is my concern fake? I'm your fiancée, and you two cheated on me behind my back. How is that my fault?\" Alice's eyes welled up with tears.\nWilliam looked at her coldly, seeing through her act.\nAlvin had found them because of Alice's scheming.\nAlvin's eyes blazed with fury as he pointed at William and shouted, \"You bastard! How dare you take advantage of my daughter! I told you, if you have a grudge, take it out on me! Do you think I don't know that you were behind the bridge collapse ten years ago that killed your parents? \n\"And two years ago, you framed me for the sports arena collapse, sending me to prison. You did all this to bankrupt the Carter family and put me behind bars. Fine, I went to prison as you wished, but why do you still torment my daughter? You're relentless in your revenge!\" As Alvin spoke, he threw another punch at William.\nWilliam gritted his teeth and took the hit without a sound.\nVictoria stood there, stunned by Alvin's words, her body trembling and her eyes filling with tears.\nNo wonder William had initially paid her to be his mistress, and for the past two years, he had humiliated and abused her, allowing Ella and Alice to torment her, leading to online harassment, imprisonment, and near-death experiences.\nThe times he had saved her life were only because he hadn't finished his revenge, not out of any genuine care.\nAnd she had foolishly believed he cared for her.\nShe had even fallen in love with him!\nVictoria felt a cold chill wash over her, and tears streamed down her face.\n\"Victoria, it's not what you think,\" William tried to explain, his voice hoarse and urgent.\nVictoria suddenly pushed him away, shouting angrily, \"It's all a lie! William, you're despicable! I was stupid enough to believe you would help me investigate my dad's case, but it was all part of your plan! No wonder you never found the kidnappers when I was abducted. You were in on it with them! William, you're vile!\"\nVictoria screamed hysterically.\nShe hated William. She had trusted him, seen him as her support and safe haven, but he had cruelly shattered her dreams.\n\"Victoria, no, I could never be in league with your kidnappers,\" William pleaded desperately.\nThe more urgent his tone, the more guilty he seemed.\n\"Swear on your parents' names that those kidnappers weren't from the Scott family,\" Victoria demanded, her eyes filled with hatred.\nWilliam fell silent.\nThough the kidnappers weren't his people, they could have been Wayne's.\nBut he couldn't explain that now.\nSeeing William's silence, Victoria lost control.\nShe lunged at him, grabbing his collar and slapping him hard across the face.\nA loud smack echoed, and red marks appeared on William's cheek.\n\"William, you bastard! You've been using and hurting me all along! I was heartbroken over you, and I was so stupid to believe you cared for me!\"\n\"Victoria!\" William grabbed her slender shoulders, his voice filled with pain. \"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.\"\n\"Shut up!\" Victoria struggled wildly, shoving William away. \"I'll never trust you again.\"\nVictoria stumbled out of the room, and Alvin shot William a fierce glare before chasing after her.\nVictoria ran, crying uncontrollably. Her mind was blank, as if she were lost in a fog, unable to see the way forward.\nShe ran aimlessly, tirelessly.\nOne thought echoed in her mind: \"William, I hate you.\"\nAlice hadn't expected things to escalate so dramatically.\nShe was secretly delighted by the outcome but kept her composure.\nSeeing the slap mark on William's face, she put on a worried expression and approached him. \"William, does it hurt? Let me...\"\nBefore she could finish, William suddenly raised his hand and slapped her hard.\n\"Are you happy now?\" William's voice was icy, his teeth clenched.\nAlice clutched her stinging cheek, tears welling up. \"William!\"\nWilliam sneered, mocking her. \"Alice, your acting has always been terrible.\"\nAlice was stunned.\nWilliam calmly wiped the blood from his lips, taunting, \"You think that with Victoria out of the picture, I'd be with you? You're delusional. Even without Victoria, I'd never be with you.\"\n\"William!\" Alice dropped her pretense, her voice sharp. \"Have you forgotten that I was gang-raped because I saved you? You owe me your life! You have to take responsibility! You can't leave me!\"\n\"I owe you my life?\" William repeated softly, a look of sorrow and despair in his eyes. \"Fine, I'll pay it back!\"\nAs he spoke, William picked up a nearby fruit knife and plunged it into his own abdomen.",

He just wanted Victoria to break up with William for good.\nThe Scott family's situation was too complicated, and Victoria was too kind-hearted and naive. William was not right for her.\nBut who could have predicted this outcome?\nHe had chased Victoria all the way back home.\nAs soon as Victoria got home, she slammed the door shut.\nAlvin knew she was in a state of emotional collapse, and it wasn't the right time to talk. He could only wait outside for her to process everything.\nVictoria curled up on her bed, hugging herself, silent tears streaming down her cheeks.\nWilliam, William, how could you be so cruel?\nHer vision blurred, and her tears soaked the pillow.\nShe had never doubted William's feelings for her, but at this moment, she realized how wrong she had been.\nShe had foolishly fallen in love with an enemy!\nVictoria lay on the bed in a daze, memories of William's handsome, gentle face, his affectionate smiles, and his kisses flashing before her eyes, as if it all happened just yesterday.\nIt was all a lie.\nThe next morning, Victoria opened her eyes to find the room filled with daylight.\nShe stared blankly at the light seeping through the curtains for a long time.\nShe groggily opened the door to go to the bathroom, but stopped in her tracks.\nAlvin was curled up by the door, leaning against the wall, his head drooping wearily. It was clear he had been sitting there all night.\nHis hair was disheveled, streaked with gray, and the morning light made it look even more striking.\nHis face was etched with exhaustion and weariness, and his usually straight back was slightly hunched, as if he had aged ten years overnight.\nVictoria's heart tightened, and her eyes instantly welled up with tears.\nShe never expected Alvin to stay by the door all night.\nLast night, she had been heartbroken, crying her eyes out in her room, completely oblivious to Alvin's feelings. Now, thinking back, Alvin must have been in just as much pain.\n\"Dad,\" she called softly, her voice thick with tears.\nAlvin's body trembled, and he slowly lifted his head, his bloodshot eyes filled with worry and affection as he looked at Victoria. \"Victoria, you're awake.\"\nHe tried to stand up, but his legs were numb from sitting too long, and he almost fell.\nVictoria quickly supported Alvin, her hand touching his cold arm, and she couldn't hold back her tears any longer. \"Dad, why did you sit here all night? You didn't have to.\"\nAlvin steadied himself and gently patted Victoria's hand, forcing a smile. \"I was worried about you. Hearing you cry in your room last night broke my heart. I know you're hurting, but I don't want to see you give up. The Carter family has been through so much, but as long as we have each other, we can get through anything.\"\nVictoria threw herself into Alvin's arms, sobbing uncontrollably. \"Dad, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been so impulsive and made you worry.\"\nShe thought about her attitude towards Alvin last night and felt a deep sense of regret. Alvin had already sacrificed so much for the family and endured so much suffering. How could she continue to be so reckless?\nAlvin held Victoria, gently stroking her hair. \"Hey, it's not your fault. I should have protected you better. I promise you, I won't let you suffer like this again.\"\nThey held each other for a long time until Victoria's emotions gradually calmed down.\nShe sniffled and said, \"Dad, don't worry. I'm okay now.\"\nAlvin released her and looked at her kindly. \"Really?\"\nVictoria nodded firmly, forcing a smile. \"It's just a guy. Besides, it was never going to work out between us. I won't waste my tears on someone like him.\"\nAlvin was relieved to hear her words. \"That's the spirit. As long as you can move on, I'll be at ease. Now go freshen up, and I'll make you breakfast.\"\nWhen Daisy arrived at the hospital, William was in surgery.\nShe walked up to Alice and suddenly slapped her across the face.\nAlice was caught off guard and stunned by the blow.\n\"Alice, if anything happens to William, I'll kill you!\" Daisy roared.\nHer eyes were filled with a chilling fury, and she looked like she wanted to tear Alice apart.\nAlice clutched her reddened cheek, her eyes dim. \"I'm sorry, Ms. Scott. I never thought things would turn out this way.\"\nDaisy laughed bitterly. \"Alice, I thought you were a bit crazy, but I believed you genuinely loved William, so I didn't oppose your relationship or even your marriage. But look at what you've done. Do you know how many times he's been hurt because of you?\"\nAlice gritted her teeth, saying nothing.\nDaisy sneered. \"I'm warning you, stay away from William from now on. Stop bringing him trouble!\"\nAlice's eyes reddened, and she shook her head. \"I can't leave William. Without him, I'd die.\"\nDaisy gave her a look of disgust. \"Enough. Whether you live or die is none of my business. You better pray William is okay, or else...\"\nBefore she could finish, the door to the operating room opened, and the doctor wheeled William out.\nDaisy and Alice rushed over. \"Doctor, how is he?\"\nThe doctor removed his mask, revealing a face that was both unfamiliar and familiar. \"William lost a lot of blood and is out of immediate danger, but...\"\nDaisy and Alice's faces paled.\nThe doctor sighed. \"He needs to stay in the hospital for observation. If his recovery doesn't go well, he might need to be moved to the ICU.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Daisy said politely, nodding in gratitude.\nAlice stood in a daze for a moment, then hurried to William's bedside, leaning over him and whispering, \"William, wake up.\"\nDaisy stared at William's pale face, her brows furrowed.\nSeeing Alice so worried, she knew it would be impossible to make her leave.\nThis was a hospital, and forcibly dragging Alice out could cause a scene. If things got out of hand and affected the Scott family's reputation, it would be bad.\nAfter much consideration, Daisy finally decided to hold back her anger and wait until William woke up to deal with it.",

Ms. Simpson's been really understanding, but I don't want to push it.\"\nAlvin sighed and said, \"Why not just quit? You need to focus on your University of Aesthetics Shine exams. I can support you.\"\nVictoria smiled softly. \"Dad, Starry Studio Gallery is one of the top galleries in the country. I worked really hard to get in, and I'm learning things there that I can't learn in school. I need to seize this opportunity.\"\nAlvin frowned, hesitated for a moment, and then said, \"I won't force you, but don't overdo it. If you get too tired, let me know.\"\n\"Don't worry, Dad. I know my limits.\" Victoria took a deep breath, clenched her fists, and resolutely walked out the door.\nAlvin watched her slender figure disappear, feeling a mix of pride and concern.\nVictoria was so determined!\nJust as he turned to go back inside, his phone rang. It was Daisy.\nVictoria mustered her energy and arrived at Starry Studio Gallery. As soon as she stepped inside, Wendy noticed something was off.\nVictoria's usually bright eyes were dull, and her face was pale, as if she'd been through something tough.\n\"Victoria, are you okay?\" Wendy put down the frame she was organizing and asked with concern.\nNot wanting to worry her, Victoria forced a smile and said with a slight nasal tone, \"Just a bit of a cold. I might not be at my best, but don't worry.\"\nWendy looked at her skeptically. \"Are you sure?\"\nVictoria nodded. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\"\nShe went to her workstation and buried herself in her tasks, avoiding further conversation.\nSeeing Victoria's preoccupied look, Wendy didn't press further. She gently patted Victoria's shoulder and quietly made her a steaming cup of coffee.\nVictoria looked up and smiled gratefully.\nAfter finishing the coffee, Victoria felt more energized and pushed her worries aside, focusing entirely on her work.\nShe meticulously cleaned the glass displays, making sure every corner was spotless, which helped lift her spirits a bit.\nWhen interacting with customers, she maintained her professionalism and enthusiasm, patiently explaining the features and background of each artwork.\nHer dedication and knowledge impressed the customers, who left satisfied and praised her expertise.\nThe compliments from the customers significantly improved Victoria's mood.\nIndeed, work was the best remedy for her troubles.\nVictoria managed to get through the day with renewed vigor.\nAs she was packing up to leave, she heard a commotion outside.\nShe paused and looked out to see a handsome man in a light gray cashmere coat and gold-rimmed glasses standing at the gallery entrance with a bouquet of roses.\nHe was tall and well-built, with striking features and an air of refined elegance, like a noble from a bygone era.\nNot only was he familiar to Victoria, but many of her colleagues recognized him too.\n\"Isn't that Professor Brown from the University of Aesthetics Shine? What's he doing here?\" one colleague exclaimed.\nAnother chimed in, \"He's holding flowers. Is he here to confess to someone?\"\n\"Who could be so lucky to catch Professor Brown's eye?\"\n\"Professor Brown is known for being aloof and distant. Could he be interested in someone from our gallery?\"\nThe staff buzzed with speculation.\nSamuel stood quietly, a gentle smile on his lips.\nHis gaze cut through the crowd, landing directly on Victoria.\nVictoria was momentarily stunned.\nWasn't he supposed to be discharged the day after tomorrow?\nWhy was he here early?\nA wave of inexplicable guilt washed over her, but she quickly suppressed it.\nShe hurriedly gathered her things and walked out.\nAs soon as Samuel saw her, his smile deepened. He handed her the roses and said softly, \"Victoria, I'm here to pick you up.\"\nHer colleagues' eyes widened in shock.\n\"Oh my God! Professor Brown is really pursuing Victoria! Am I seeing this right?\"\n\"Victoria is so lucky! She's both Joshua's student and Professor Brown's love interest.\"\n\"I'm so jealous!\"\nWendy watched the scene unfold, feeling happy for Victoria.\nSamuel was much more reliable than William. Victoria would surely be happy with him.\nVictoria looked at the vibrant roses in her hand, feeling a mix of emotions.\n\"Samuel, weren't you supposed to be discharged the day after tomorrow? Why are you out early?\" she asked quietly.\n\"I wanted to surprise you,\" Samuel replied with a warm smile, his eyes full of affection. \"Are you happy?\"\nVictoria lowered her gaze, contemplating for a moment. \"I'm very happy.\"\nSamuel's eyes darkened slightly as he gazed at her.\nHe reached out and gently tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, his tone indulgent. \"What's wrong? You seem a bit down.\"\nVictoria bit her lip and said softly, \"Nothing, just a bit hungry.\"\nSamuel chuckled. \"Then let me take you to get something good to eat.\"\nHe took her hand and led her to a black Bentley parked nearby.\nThey arrived at a quiet restaurant and chose a window seat.\nSamuel thoughtfully pulled out her chair and ordered her favorite dishes.\nWhile waiting for their food, Samuel rested his chin on his hands and quietly watched Victoria. Suddenly, he spoke, \"Victoria, I know something's on your mind. If you want, you can talk to me. Even if I can't help, at least let me share your burden.\"\nVictoria looked out at the bustling street, silent for a long time.\nFinally, she seemed to make a decision. She turned to Samuel and said slowly, \"Samuel, let's go public.\"\n\"Go public?\" Samuel raised an eyebrow, a hint of surprise in his eyes.\nHe hadn't expected Victoria to suggest it, but he was delighted by her initiative.\n\"Yes, let's post on social media and announce our relationship. Is that okay?\" Victoria's voice was soft.",

She took out her phone, gently wrapped her arm around Samuel's, and rested her head on his shoulder, finding the perfect angle to take a selfie of the two of them.\nIn the photo, Samuel had a gentle smile on his lips, his eyes full of affection, while Victoria leaned on his shoulder, looking delicate and sweet.\nThey made a striking couple, handsome and beautiful, perfectly matched.\nA simple photo, yet it captured a sense of timeless tranquility.\nVictoria typed a simple caption: [Boyfriend.]\nShe attached the photo and hit send.\nAlmost instantly, her phone started buzzing non-stop with notifications.\nElara sent a heart emoji along with a voice message: \"Victoria, I'm so happy to see you find happiness!\"\nWendy sent a string of exclamation marks: [I knew you two were perfect for each other, so sweet!]\nDiana commented: [Congrats on finding love! Stay happy forever!]\nAlvin even called, his voice filled with relief. \"Victoria, I saw your post. As long as you're happy, I'm at ease. This guy looks good; bring him home sometime so I can officially meet him.\n\"I have to go to the neighboring city for something today. Stay safe at home, and I'll make you something delicious when I get back tomorrow.\"\nLooking at all the well-wishes, Victoria's initial hesitation slowly turned into determination.\nForget about those who aren't worth it and the unpleasant things. The world is so beautiful, she should cherish the happiness in front of her.\nSamuel sat beside Victoria, quietly listening to her phone conversations, the warmth in his eyes growing deeper.\nHe also posted on his feed.\nBut he didn't have many friends.\nJust a few colleagues and students from school sending their blessings.\nAnd then there was Ryan's message: [Way to go, Samuel! Finally made it, huh? You gotta treat us to a meal now that you've won the beauty!]\nSamuel chuckled and agreed.\nHe knew Victoria still had many ties to William.\nBut so what? Someone who doesn't know how to cherish her doesn't deserve her.\nSamuel thought, gripping his phone, looking at Victoria's serene profile, his gaze growing more intense.\nAfter dinner, Samuel drove Victoria home.\nThe car slowly came to a stop in front of her house. Victoria sat in the passenger seat, her fingers unconsciously tracing the door handle, her eyes looking out at her front door.\nSamuel seemed to sense her hesitation and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\nVictoria hesitated for a long moment before turning to Samuel and softly saying, \"Come up for a bit.\"\nHer voice had a slight tremor, which Samuel keenly noticed.\nSamuel's eyes darkened instantly, his voice hoarse as he asked, \"Victoria, you know what this means, right?\"\nVictoria bit her lip and softly replied, \"Yes, I know. You're my boyfriend.\"\n\"Yes.\" Samuel responded in a low, deep voice, \"Alright, baby.\"\nWith that, he leaned in and kissed Victoria's lips, deeply and passionately.\nVictoria closed her eyes, letting Samuel kiss her, her heart racing.\nSamuel's kiss was intense and passionate, claiming every inch of her, as if he wanted to devour her whole. She had never imagined that someone as gentle and refined as Samuel could have such a side.\nVictoria was breathless from his kiss, her hands pressed against his strong chest.\nAfter a long while, he reluctantly pulled away from her lips.\nLooking at her flushed face, Samuel's throat moved, his voice hoarse, \"Victoria, let's go upstairs. I feel like I'm about to explode.\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes, not daring to look at Samuel's eyes filled with desire.\nShe didn't know if this decision was a mistake, but she knew that only by doing this could she truly rid herself of William's influence.\nThough it was unfair to Samuel, she had no other choice.\nVictoria nodded slightly, opened the car door, and led Samuel into her house.\nVIP ward at the hospital\nWilliam lay in bed, an IV in his hand, his handsome face pale and bloodless.\nHe opened his eyes, staring blankly at the white ceiling.\nUpon waking, the first thing that came to his mind was Victoria's face-her shyness, fear, stubbornness, and the look of terror and disgust when she left him yesterday.\nAll her emotions flashed through his mind, disrupting his thoughts, almost shattering his soul.\nHe reached out to touch his chest, as if he could still feel the tearing pain there.\nWilliam closed his eyes, his long lashes casting shadows over his sharp nose.\nHe had never regretted anything as much as he did now, regretting how he had hurt her.\n\"William, you're awake?\"\nAlice pushed the door open, seeing William's clenched fist and the IV tube half-filled with backflowing blood. She was terrified and quickly called for medical staff.\nSeeing this, William's cold eyes swept over everyone, finally landing on Alice's face. His voice was icy, \"Who let you in? Get out!\"\n\"William!\" Alice was extremely aggrieved, tears welling up in her eyes.\nWilliam's thick brows furrowed, his tone growing colder, \"Get out.\"\nHis voice was so cold it sent a chill through the room, making the medical staff shiver.\n\"William, please don't get agitated. Listen to me, okay? Your wounds haven't healed yet. I'm worried they'll reopen.\"\nShe choked up, stepping forward to grab William's other hand that wasn't hooked to the IV.\nWilliam pushed her away, using so much force that his abdominal wound tore open again, oozing blood.\nAlice was stunned by his actions, staring at William in shock, murmuring, \"William!\"\nWilliam's face was as pale as paper, sweat beading on his forehead.\nThis fragile William was heart-wrenching.\nHe stared at her, his eyes filled with undisguised hatred, \"Alice, let's break up. I've wasted your time, and I'll compensate you with three hundred million dollars.\"\n\"I don't need money!\" Alice shouted, tears streaming down her face, \"William, why do you have to be so cruel to me? You're hurt like this, and she hasn't even come to see you. I'm the only one who truly loves you. Why can't you love me?\"",

        "content": "William's eyes suddenly turned icy as he snapped, \"Enough!\"\nHe glared at Alice with a cold expression. \"You can't force feelings. I don't love you, and dragging this out won't help either of us. If you keep bugging me, don't blame me for handing you over to your stepmother, Willow. I'm sure she and Ella would love that.\"\nAlice's whole body trembled at his words, and she stared at William in disbelief.\nShe shivered, knowing that once William made up his mind, he wouldn't change it.\nThe memory of being watched and controlled abroad still terrified her.\nTo get rid of her, he could be so heartless.\nAs Daisy pushed the door open, Alice ran out, heartbroken and in tears.\nDaisy frowned, looking at the weak William on the hospital bed. \"What happened to her? Why is she crying so hard?\"\nWilliam furrowed his brow and said indifferently, \"I broke up with her.\"\nDaisy raised an eyebrow. \"Really?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Good.\" Daisy shrugged and sighed. \"You two were never right for each other. Why torture yourselves by staying together?\"\nThen, as if remembering something, Daisy's eyes sharpened. She walked quickly to William's bedside and jabbed his shoulder angrily. \"You! You never let anyone rest easy! Playing with your life like that, do you know how worried I was? If something happened to you, how would I explain it to your deceased parents?\"\nHer eyes reddened, and her voice choked with emotion.\nWilliam had never seen Daisy like this, and he felt a pang of guilt.\nFor the past ten years, Daisy had been more than a mother to him, caring for him meticulously.\nBut he was too stubborn, always making Daisy worry.\nHe pressed his lips together and softly reassured her, \"Aunt Daisy, I promise I won't do anything foolish again.\"\nDaisy snorted. \"Save those promises. I don't buy it.\"\nWilliam fell silent.\nHe took a deep breath and softened his voice. \"Aunt Daisy, I really know I was wrong. I know you mean well, and I've let you down.\"\nDaisy shook her head, her eyes moist. \"Silly boy, you're my nephew. I just want the best for you.\"\nShe wiped away her tears and smiled. \"Alright, take care of yourself. I have to go to the company and hold down the fort for you.\"\nShe stood up, ready to leave.\n\"Aunt Daisy!\" William called out, his tone hesitant. \"Um...\"\nDaisy paused and looked back at William.\nWilliam seemed to want to say something but fell silent again.\nSeeing his hesitation, Daisy knew what he was thinking. She said softly, \"I know you want to ask about Victoria.\"\nShe paused, then added, \"Don't worry. She's always been strong. She went to work as usual today.\"\nWilliam was taken aback, a hint of bitterness on his face. \"That's good.\"\nDaisy sighed at his expression. \"William, she doesn't know you're hurt. I called her dad, and he was adamant about not letting you disrupt her life anymore. Give each other some space.\"\nWilliam's eyes dimmed, and he clenched the blanket tightly. After a long silence, he said in a low voice, \"I understand, Aunt Daisy. I won't bother her again.\"\nShe must hate him.\nIf he were in her shoes, he'd want to kill the person who treated him like that.\nWilliam closed his eyes, exhausted, lying on the bed, his face even paler than before.\nDaisy looked at his desolate expression, feeling a pang of sorrow. She hesitated but then advised, \"William, there are too many obstacles between you and Victoria. It's not something that can be resolved quickly. If you really care about her, focus on getting better first, then think about other things.\"\n\"I get it,\" William replied, his voice muffled.\nDaisy patted his back. \"I'll head to the company now. I'll come back to see you after the afternoon meeting.\"\nWith that, she turned and left the room.\nAfter Daisy left, the room fell into a brief silence.\nSoon, hurried footsteps approached, and Harry rushed into the room.\nHe stopped abruptly at the door, his lips trembling as if he had something difficult to say.\nWilliam glanced at him, his gaze indifferent. Seeing Harry's hesitation, he felt a surge of impatience. \"Spit it out.\"\nHarry swallowed hard and walked to the bedside, pulling out his phone. He handed it to William, showing him Victoria's latest post. \"Mr. Scott, you should see this.\"\nWilliam frowned and reached for the phone. As soon as he saw the screen, his expression froze.\nOn the screen, Victoria was leaning intimately on Samuel's shoulder, smiling sweetly, looking happy and beautiful.\nThe caption read: [Boyfriend.]\nIt felt like an invisible hand was squeezing his heart, the pain spreading through his body, making it hard to breathe.\nHis knuckles turned white as he gripped the phone, veins bulging from the effort.\nHarry, seeing his reaction, was startled and quickly reminded him, \"Mr. Scott, the doctor warned you not to get upset. If your wound reopens, it'll be trouble.\"\nAs soon as he finished speaking, there was a loud crash. The phone fell from William's hand, shattering on the floor.\nHarry tried to catch it but missed, looking at the broken pieces with a pained expression.\nIt was his phone, and this was the umpteenth one William had broken.\nWilliam stared at the shattered phone, his gaze dark and brooding.\n\"Mr. Scott!\" Harry called out cautiously, then hesitantly added, \"The bodyguards we sent to protect Ms. Carter reported that Samuel took her out for dinner with roses and went into her house when he dropped her off.\"\nHis voice grew quieter, almost inaudible by the last few words, not daring to look at William's face.\nWilliam's face turned ashen, the light in his eyes fading, replaced by endless pain and despair.\nHis fists clenched tightly, knuckles white from the pressure, his body trembling uncontrollably.\nA mouthful of blood spurted from his mouth, staining the white sheets with a glaring red.\n\"Mr. Scott!\" Harry's eyes widened in horror as he scrambled to press the call button, but William stopped him.\nWilliam wiped the blood from his mouth, his eyes empty, his voice hoarse and weak. \"Leave. Let me be alone.\"",

The beautiful memories he had shared with Victoria now felt like the sharpest blades, cutting deep into his heart.\nHe never thought Victoria would leave him so ruthlessly, discarding all their love as if it never existed.\nWilliam felt a dull, unbearable pain in his chest as warm blood seeped from the wound in his abdomen.\nIgnoring it, he slowly pulled the blanket up over his body, curling into a ball as the warmth of the blood soaked through his clothes and spread out.\nSamuel held Victoria's hand as they walked into the room.\nThe door closed softly behind them, and the atmosphere instantly became intimate and charged.\nSamuel looked at Victoria's delicate face, his throat dry and his heart pounding so hard it felt like it might burst out of his chest.\nSensing his intense gaze, Victoria took a small step back, trying to avoid getting too close.\nA flicker of disappointment crossed Samuel's eyes, but he quickly smiled brightly. \"Victoria, I've waited so long for this day.\"\nHis voice was deep and gentle, like a fine wine, intoxicating.\nVictoria looked up into his eyes, seeing her reflection and the overflowing love within them.\nShe parted her lips slightly but didn't know what to say.\nSeeing this, a hint of hurt flashed in Samuel's eyes, but he still stepped forward gently, pulling her into his arms, resting his chin on her head as if he were holding the most precious treasure in the world.\n\"Victoria, if you regret this, it's not too late to stop,\" Samuel coaxed softly.\nVictoria hesitated, then shook her head and whispered, \"I don't regret it.\"\nHer answer made Samuel's heart leap with joy.\nHe held her slender waist tighter, as if trying to merge her into his very being, forever part of his soul.\nSamuel's lips pressed against the hair on her forehead, greedily inhaling her unique scent.\nVictoria's body stiffened, not daring to move.\nSamuel's kisses were hot and lingering, his hands caressing her soft skin, finally resting on her neck, gently stroking, sending shivers down her spine.\nVictoria's body tensed further, her breathing deepened, and her eyes filled with a layer of warm tears.\nSamuel lowered his head, taking her sensitive earlobe into his mouth, gently nibbling, causing her to tremble.\nVictoria's body jolted, and she instinctively pushed against Samuel. \"Samuel!\"\nHer voice trembled, tinged with helplessness.\nSamuel ignored her, continuing to kiss and nibble on her earlobe, his tongue slowly parting her lips, seeking her warmth.\nHis kisses were tender and reverent, treating her like a rare treasure, not wanting to hurt her in the slightest.\nBut Victoria's heart was filled with conflict and unease. While she felt the intimacy, an invisible barrier kept her from fully giving in.\nHer body trembled slightly in Samuel's embrace, feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of his emotions.\nWith a gasp, Samuel lifted her and carried her to the bed, gently laying her down on the soft, spacious mattress.\nHe leaned over her, kissing her moist, red lips.\nHis kisses were as gentle as water, lightly pecking at her lips.\nThe distance between them was less than an inch, their noses touching, warm breaths mingling.\nVictoria lay on the bed, eyes closed, long lashes trembling, breathing uneasily.\nSamuel's kisses trailed down her long neck, finally nibbling at her collarbone, causing Victoria to shiver.\nSamuel chuckled softly, using his finger to playfully tap her pink nose. \"Don't be afraid, sweetheart.\"\nVictoria kept her eyes closed, silent, as if resigned to Samuel's caresses.\nSeeing this, Samuel's heart ached. He gently unbuttoned her shirt, revealing her delicate, sensual body.\nSamuel's breathing quickened, his large hands caressing her chest through the thin fabric, creating a wave of heat.\nVictoria's body arched slightly, showing her inner turmoil.\nSamuel's hand slid down her back, finally resting on her slender thigh, his fingers teasing, sparking intimate flames.\nSamuel's breathing grew heavier, his gaze falling on her underwear. He swallowed hard, removing his clothes, standing naked before Victoria.\nSamuel's body was lean and muscular, his chest broad, six-pack abs clearly defined, exuding male hormones, showing he worked out regularly.\nBut compared to William, he was still slimmer.\nVictoria hesitated, biting her lip.\nHadn't she told herself repeatedly not to think about William anymore?\nWhy couldn't she control her heart from fluttering because of him?\n\"Victoria,\" Samuel murmured, his voice hoarse and restrained.\nHe slowly leaned down, turning Victoria to face him.\nSamuel's eyes were bright and shining, and as he moved, Victoria felt something hard pressing against her softest spot, burning hot.\nStaring at her beautiful, pure face, Samuel's lips moved, his voice raspy. \"Victoria, is this okay?\"\nSamuel's words were like a bomb, exploding in Victoria's heart.\nHer face turned pale instantly. She struggled to sit up, grabbing a towel to cover herself. \"I'm sorry, Samuel, I can't do this!\"\nVictoria's expression was panicked, almost frantic, tears welling up in her eyes, ready to spill over.\nHer reaction made Samuel's pupils contract sharply, his body tensing, throat tightening, a strong desire rising within him, making him want to tear the towel away and take her.\nBut he couldn't bear to hurt her.\nSamuel sighed, climbing off her, struggling to control his emotions, his voice hoarse. \"Sorry, I'll go to the bathroom.\"",

The soft click of the door felt like a heavy blow to Victoria's heart.\nShe had hurt him deeply once again.\nIn the bathroom, Samuel's erection was painfully hard. His handsome face was etched with unbearable pain.\nThe woman he loved was just on the other side of the wall, but he couldn't touch her. Every second felt like torture.\n\"Victoria,\" Samuel murmured softly, looking down at his rigid member with a bitter smile.\nThinking of Victoria's seductive look just moments ago, he had no choice but to take care of himself quickly.\nVictoria dressed and listened to Samuel's muffled breathing from the bathroom, feeling overwhelmed with guilt.\nShe had invited him up, said she had no regrets, but then stopped him at the last moment.\nCovering her face, Victoria felt a wave of self-loathing. How could she be so selfish?\nSamuel stayed in the bathroom for a long time, taking a cold shower to calm himself down. Once he felt more composed, he dressed and slowly opened the bathroom door.\nHe immediately saw Victoria curled up in the corner of the bed, her cheeks stained with tears, looking pitiful.\nSamuel's heart ached. He walked over to her and gently held her shoulders.\n\"Victoria, why are you crying?\" Samuel asked softly, wiping away her tears.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Victoria choked out, her voice breaking, her eyes red.\nShe knew how hard it was for a man to stop at the last moment.\nBut he had respected her wishes.\nSamuel's heart softened. He pulled Victoria into his arms, gently patting her back, soothing her with his voice. \"Silly girl, you're just not ready yet. We'll take it slow, okay?\"\nSamuel's voice had a calming effect, gradually easing Victoria's guilt and helping her regain her composure.\nVictoria looked up at Samuel, her eyes filled with confusion.\n\"I won't force you,\" Samuel said, cupping her face and wiping away her tears with his thumb, his voice gentle.\n\"Thank you, Samuel,\" Victoria said, her voice trembling.\nShe was truly grateful for Samuel's patience and affection. She had never experienced such feelings before and didn't know how to reciprocate.\nVictoria wrapped her arms around Samuel's strong waist, pressing her face against his warm chest, inhaling the scent of his body wash. She kept telling herself to cherish him and to forget William completely.\nSamuel let Victoria lean against him for a long time before speaking softly. \"Victoria, my grandfather's birthday is coming up. Will you come with me?\"\nVictoria was taken aback and looked up at Samuel.\nHe looked tired, with dark circles under his eyes.\nAfter a moment of thought, Victoria decided to agree.\nThey were officially a couple now. If she didn't attend Samuel's grandfather's birthday party, it would embarrass him.\nVictoria bit her lip and asked softly, \"When is it?\"\nSamuel's eyes sparkled with a hint of a smile. \"Next Saturday.\"\nVictoria nodded. \"Okay.\"\n\"Get some rest. I'll head out now.\"\nSamuel stood up, stopping Victoria from getting up to see him out. He straightened her messy blanket and left her home.\nHis back was straight, but there was a hint of loneliness in his posture.\nVictoria lowered her eyes, hiding the overwhelming guilt she felt.\nShe knew she wouldn't be able to sleep tonight.\nThe news of William and Alice's breakup spread quickly, with all sorts of rumors flying around, but both parties remained silent.\nBy the time Eugene heard the news and rushed to the hospital, William's injuries had mostly healed.\nBut he had lost a lot of weight, and his once handsome face was now gaunt and haggard.\nEugene couldn't believe how much William had changed in just a few days. \"What happened to you? Did you hurt yourself because you were heartbroken over Alice?\"\nWilliam glanced at him, his voice calm. \"Who told you that?\"\nEugene was taken aback, then scoffed. \"Everyone knows you and Alice broke up.\"\nWilliam's eyes narrowed, and he spoke quietly. \"We did break up, but I didn't hurt myself out of heartbreak. I did it to get rid of her.\"\nEugene was shocked. \"You risked your life just to break up with her? Are you crazy?\"\nEugene had known William since they were kids. He knew William wouldn't give up on Alice unless something serious had happened.\n\"What else could I do?\" William's face was pale, his stomach still wrapped in thick bandages. \"I owed her. I had to repay her.\"\n\"All for Victoria? My God, you're out of your mind!\" Eugene couldn't believe it. He paced the hospital room, furious at William's reckless behavior.\n\"You and Alice are both insane! She was devoted to you, losing herself in the process, and you turn around and risk everything for another woman. What did I do in a past life to deserve knowing you two?\"\nWilliam reached out his hand. \"Lighter.\"\nEugene glared at him but handed over the lighter.\nWilliam lit a cigarette, taking a deep drag. His eyes were distant, lost in the smoke.\nEugene frowned. \"You and Alice...\"\nWilliam took another drag, then looked up at the night sky, exhaling a cloud of smoke with a bitter smile.\nHe didn't say a word, but Eugene seemed to understand everything.\nHe patted William's shoulder, then hesitated when he saw the bandages. With a sigh, he said, \"Forget it. Just let it be.\"\nEven though William had always kept his promises, feelings based on guilt and obligation could easily fade, leaving only exhaustion and mutual harm.\n\"So, what now? Are you going to be with Victoria?\" Eugene asked suddenly.\nWilliam lowered his eyes. The proud man looked pained, as if his soul had been drained.\n\"She's with someone else now,\" he said lightly.\nEugene was stunned.\nHe couldn't believe someone had taken William's woman.\n\"That's not like you. Didn't you think about fighting for her?\" Eugene couldn't help but ask. \"William, I don't get you. If you like her, go after her! As long as she's not married, anything can happen.\"\nWilliam let out a bitter laugh, his eyes fixed on a distant point. \"She hates me. She'll never forgive me.\"",

Even someone as proud and untouchable as William had been brought to his knees by it.\nEugene was about to offer some comforting words when his phone buzzed in his pocket.\nHe pulled it out, checked the screen, and answered the call.\nThe person on the other end spoke softly, and Eugene listened carefully before quickly agreeing.\nAfter hanging up, he slipped his phone back into his pocket and looked up to find William's gaze fixed on him.\n\"William, what's wrong?\" he asked, feeling a bit unnerved by the intensity.\n\"Is it Mr. Brown's birthday party?\" William raised an eyebrow. \"I'll go with you.\"\nEugene was caught off guard.\nWilliam flicked the ash from his cigarette, his deep eyes fixed on the horizon.\nSaturday afternoon, sunlight filtered through thin clouds, gently illuminating the street.\nSamuel's black Bentley slowly pulled up in front of Victoria's apartment building.\nA moment later, Victoria stepped out, and it was as if the air around her brightened.\nShe wore a light blue off-shoulder gown that flowed gracefully to her ankles, perfectly accentuating her slender waist and elegant figure.\nHer makeup was delicate and understated, her shiny hair loosely pinned up with a few strands falling around her long neck, adding a touch of casual allure. She looked like a fairy stepping out of a painting, breathtakingly beautiful.\nSamuel got out of the car and quickly walked over to her, his eyes filled with admiration and tenderness.\nHe extended his hand, gently taking Victoria's arm. \"You look stunning today.\"\nVictoria blushed slightly and smiled. \"You look handsome too.\"\nSamuel was dressed in a tailored suit that highlighted his tall, lean frame, paired with a simple yet elegant white shirt. His hair was meticulously styled, and beneath his fringe, his deep eyes and high-bridged nose exuded a natural grace that was hard to ignore.\nThey headed straight to the hotel.\nTonight was Samuel's grandfather's 80th birthday, and the entire Brown family was present, along with many of Elmer's business associates.\nDespite Victoria's attempts to keep a low profile, her status as Joshua's student and a gold medalist in an art competition had made her somewhat famous.\nAs soon as she arrived, a group of Brown family relatives surrounded her, scrutinizing her and bombarding her with questions.\nAfter all, Samuel was the most outstanding and picky among the younger generation of the Brown family.\nThey had introduced countless girls to him, but he had never shown interest in any of them.\nNo one expected him to choose someone as young as Victoria as his girlfriend.\nVictoria remained composed, polite, and smiling, neither ingratiating nor aloof.\nHowever, some people just didn't know when to stop-like the plump woman sitting next to Primrose, who looked at Victoria with disdain and openly mocked her. \"The Brown family has high standards for daughters-in-law. Does such an ordinary girl deserve Samuel?\"\nHer voice wasn't low, and nearby people turned to look.\nSeeing the attention, she raised her voice even more. \"This girl may look all sweet and innocent, but her private life is a mess. She broke up an engaged couple and got tangled up with Alton from the Bridges family, causing a huge scandal last year. His girlfriend ended up in jail and had to pay a ton of money. Now she's after Samuel.\"\n\"And that's not all. Her dad committed serious crimes and went to prison, leaving a mountain of debt. Like father, like daughter. With a dad like that, how good can she be?\" she added.\nSamuel's face darkened, and he strode over before Victoria could stop him.\n\"Samuel, I'm fine.\"\nSamuel approached, causing the woman to flinch. \n\"Samuel...\"\n\"Aunt Juno, I know my girlfriend better than anyone! If anyone dares to spread rumors again, don't blame me for not considering family ties!\" Samuel said coldly, his gaze icy as he looked at the middle-aged woman named Juno.\nJuno stepped back, embarrassed and angry. \"Samuel! How can you talk to me like that? I'm your aunt! You've been bewitched by this woman. You used to be so mature and sensible, but now you dare to defy your elders? Everyone can see that this girl is causing chaos even before she's married into the family. If she does, the Brown family will never have peace!\"\nShe turned to Primrose, crying, \"Primrose, look at your son! He's offending me for this woman. You need to set things right!\"\nPrimrose's face was grim.\nShe had liked Victoria when they first met. Despite her modest background, Victoria was beautiful, well-mannered, and intelligent, with a pair of clear, innocent eyes.\nPrimrose had supported the relationship, but the more she learned, the more she worried about Victoria's complicated background.\nShe wasn't snobbish; she just feared that Samuel would face trouble if he married Victoria.\nShe sighed. \"Samuel, how can you speak to Juno like that? She's your elder. Apologize to her!\"\nSamuel looked deeply at Primrose, understanding her underlying message.\nApologizing to Juno was just the surface; she also agreed with Juno's words.\nHe could hear it, and so could Victoria.\nShe lowered her eyes, her lips pressed into a thin line, saying nothing.\nSamuel clenched his fists, turned, and took Victoria's hand, leading her away.\nPrimrose was stunned. \"Samuel! Stop! Where are you taking her?\"\nIgnoring her, Samuel left the venue with Victoria.\nHe was usually polite and composed, but today he was uncharacteristically impulsive.\nElmer was in a private room with some business friends when Primrose came in. He greeted her and then stepped out.\n\"What happened?\"\n\"It's Samuel...\" She had barely explained when Elmer, furious, went to find Samuel. \"This is outrageous! Does he know what today is? Causing a scene over a woman? He's embarrassing me!\"\nApologizing to his friends, he stormed out, with Primrose following.\nThey found Samuel in the hotel lobby, kneeling to fix the folds in Victoria's dress, murmuring, \"Wait here, I'll get the car.\"\nElmer was livid, and Primrose's heart ached.\n\"You idiot!\"",

Without even glancing at Victoria, who was sitting nearby, he pointed a finger at her and yelled, \"Who the hell does she think she is? Is she worth you groveling like this? You're catering to a woman with such a complicated background?\"\nElmer, usually a calm and composed man, was clearly beside himself with anger today, speaking without thinking.\nVictoria felt a rush of blood to her head, a mix of grievance, defiance, and deep humiliation surging through her.\nSamuel was furious too. \"Dad! Watch your words!\"\n\"Don't give me that! Have you never seen a woman before? Treating this troublemaker like she's some kind of treasure! Do you know what day it is? Bringing her here not only upset the elders but also brought shame on me!\"\nVictoria couldn't take it anymore. She bit her lip hard to keep from lashing out and turned to leave.\n\"Victoria!\"\nSamuel ignored Elmer and Primrose, rushing after her. \"Victoria, don't go!\"\n\"I'm sorry, Samuel. I didn't know it would be like this. If I had known, I wouldn't have come.\"\nElmer stood there, sneering. \"You really shouldn't have come! Do you even know your place? Just because you've made a name for yourself in some gallery doesn't mean you can step into the Brown family! Let me tell you, I'd rather see my son single for life than let him marry you!\"\n\"Dad!\"\nSamuel turned back, glaring at Elmer, but still lowered his voice, pleading, \"I'm begging you, please stop.\"\nPrimrose tried to calm things down, \"Elmer, just say a little less.\"\nVictoria felt a deep ache in her heart. She had agreed to date Samuel to start a new life and leave her past behind, but it seemed like her past was always there, haunting her.\n\"Samuel, listen to your parents. You should go back.\" She tried to walk away, but Samuel held her hand tightly.\nHe had a feeling that if he let go, he would lose her forever.\nVictoria looked down at his hand gripping hers. \"Samuel, we...\"\n\"Don't say it, Victoria, please don't.\" He held her hand even tighter, his eyes starting to redden.\nAt this moment, Primrose stepped forward and gently said, \"Samuel, today is your grandfather's birthday. Don't argue with your father. How about this, I'll walk Ms. Carter out.\"\nSamuel resisted, \"If anyone's walking her out, it's me.\"\n\"Why are you being so stubborn today? It seems Juno was right...\" Primrose didn't finish her sentence, but her gaze shifted to Victoria.\nVictoria was silent for a moment, then softly said to Samuel, \"Mrs. Brown is right. You should go back inside.\"\n\"But what about you?\"\nKnowing he was worried about her, Victoria leaned in and whispered, \"You're only making this harder for me.\"\nSamuel frowned, his lips dry, reluctantly letting go of her hand. \"Text me when you get home.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nPrimrose led the way. \"Ms. Carter, I'll walk you out.\"\nVictoria waved to Samuel and followed Primrose.\nShe could tell Primrose had something to say and could guess what it was.\nThis was an issue she would have to face sooner or later; there was no point in avoiding it.\nOnce they reached the street, Primrose turned to Victoria with a look of regret. \"Victoria, I actually like you. You're smart, talented, and beautiful. Anyone who marries you would be lucky. Unfortunately, Samuel isn't that lucky. He doesn't deserve you.\"\nEven though she had expected this, Victoria still felt like a heavy stone was pressing on her chest, making it hard to breathe.\nBeing completely rejected like this made her feel like everything was her fault, like she was a total failure.\n\"We did support you and Samuel at first, but then we heard about your past with William. I'm sorry, Victoria, but the Brown family has strict values. We can't accept your past. You wouldn't want to see Samuel break away from us and still enjoy your relationship, would you?\"\nEven though Victoria was strong, being repeatedly reminded of her past wounds was hard to bear.\nBut this was Samuel's mother. Victoria didn't want to have a falling-out with her, especially since she owed Samuel so much.\nSo, despite feeling stiff and pale, she forced a smile.\nJust as she was about to speak, a clear, deep voice interrupted, \"Mrs. Brown, I think you misunderstand.\"\nVictoria turned her head in surprise.\nWilliam was striding in from the gate.\nHe was dressed in a black tailored shirt and light gray trousers, looking straight and imposing, exuding an air of nobility and restraint.\nShe hadn't expected to see him here.\nSeeing him brought back all the memories of what he had done to her.\nVictoria's face went pale, her nails digging into her palms, the pain keeping her grounded.\nPrimrose looked at Victoria, then at William, clearly not expecting to see him here.\n\"William?\" She forced a smile, \"Are you here for my father-in-law's birthday party too?\"\nShe remembered not sending him an invitation.\nAlthough the Brown family and the Scott family had business dealings, they weren't close.\n\"He came with me,\" Eugene, who had been ignored for a while, chimed in. \"William heard it was Mr. Brown's 80th birthday and wanted to come and congratulate him.\"\n\"Is that so? Thank you so much! William, please come in.\"\nPrimrose, all smiles, invited William to the hall.\nBut William didn't move. He glanced at Victoria, then looked back at Primrose, speaking coolly, \"Mrs. Brown, I heard you say this Ms. Carter has some entanglement with me?\"\nPrimrose was taken aback, then quickly explained, \"It's nothing. Just that she used to...\"\nWilliam cut her off coldly, \"I think you misunderstand. Ms. Carter was my secretary for two years. The rumors out there are just baseless gossip. The Brown family is a respected family, surely you don't believe such unfounded stories, do you?\"\nPrimrose's face turned sour, forcing a smile, \"You're right, William. Our family values rules and etiquette. Those rumors are not to be believed. Ms. Carter, please don't take it to heart.\"",

You must be really busy today, so I won't keep you any longer. I'll be on my way now.\"\nWith that, Victoria picked up her dress and hurried away in her high heels.\nShe just wanted to get out of this suffocating place.\nWilliam watched her retreating figure, his lips pressed into a tight line.\nVictoria wandered aimlessly down the street in her high heels.\nHer phone suddenly rang from her bag, the sound grating on her nerves.\nWithout looking, she knew who was calling. She paused for a moment but didn't reach for the phone.\nHer mind was a mess, and she had no idea what to say if she answered.\nThe phone rang persistently, but Victoria ignored it, walking in a daze, her eyes unfocused, oblivious to everything around her.\nWilliam sat in his car, his eyes following her petite figure through the window.\nHarry drove slowly, quietly trailing behind Victoria.\nOccasionally, there were honks from behind, but most people, seeing the expensive car, wisely chose to steer clear, not wanting any trouble.\n\"Mr. Scott, you didn't bring out this new car just to follow Ms. Carter, did you?\" Harry asked tentatively.\nWilliam shot him a glance. \"You're getting more talkative.\"\nHarry pursed his lips, not daring to say more.\nWilliam's temper was getting worse; he couldn't even take a joke anymore.\nMen who got dumped were always in a foul mood, it seemed.\nVictoria wandered aimlessly until she found herself standing outside a mall.\nThe plaza outside the mall was bustling with people.\nIt was early spring, but the weather hadn't warmed up yet. The cold wind was biting, and people hurried along, bundled up in their coats.\nThe nearby coffee shop exuded a warm, inviting atmosphere. The glass door was fogged up, and the sweet aroma wafting out attracted a line of customers.\nA couple stood at the entrance of the coffee shop.\nThe woman was slender and looked a bit worn out, wearing a thin, old coat with frayed cuffs. She rubbed her arms and softly said to the man beside her, \"Honey, it's so cold. Can I get a cup of coffee to warm up?\"\nThe man, tall and burly, looked impatient.\nHe frowned and gruffly replied, \"Coffee? Five dollars for a drink? Let's go, stop dawdling and embarrassing us!\"\nThe woman's eyes reddened instantly, tears welling up. Her long-suppressed grievances burst out, her voice trembling. \"I work so hard every day, exhausted from my job, and then I come home to cook, clean, and take care of you and the kids. Now I just want a cup of coffee, and I can't even have that? Am I not a person?\"\nThe crowd around them grew, and people began to cast reproachful glances at the man, whispering among themselves. \"He's so stingy. It's freezing, and he won't even buy his wife a coffee. That's outrageous.\"\n\"Yeah, it's just five dollars.\"\nThe man, noticing the crowd's disapproving looks, felt embarrassed.\nFurious, he threw his cigarette butt on the ground and stomped on it, then roughly grabbed the woman's wallet. \"No coffee! Give it here!\"\nIn the struggle, the woman's clothes became disheveled, and her hair fell loose, sticking to her tear-streaked face, making her look utterly miserable.\nAt that moment, a stylish handbag suddenly flew over, hitting the man's arm hard.\n\"Who did that?\" The man glared around, veins bulging on his neck.\nIn the crowd, Victoria stood tall and graceful, her face beautiful, wearing a blue dress under her wool coat.\nShe stepped forward, picked up the handbag from the ground, dusted it off, and slung it over her shoulder. Then she walked to the woman's side and gently helped her up.\nLooking at the man with disdain, she said slowly, \"In your eyes, your wife, who shares your life, doesn't even deserve a five-dollar coffee?\"\nThe woman trembled at these words, her despair deepening. Her lips quivered as she shouted at the man for the first time, \"Divorce! I can't live like this anymore!\"\nThe crowd chimed in, \"Divorce him! A man who doesn't care for his wife isn't worth keeping!\"\n\"Exactly, so selfish, can't even spend a little money on his wife.\"\nThe man, now enraged, directed his fury at Victoria. \"You nosy woman! This is between me and my wife. Who asked for your opinion?\"\nHe cursed and raised his hand to strike Victoria.\nBut before he could touch her, a dark figure blocked his way, and the next moment, the man was kicked to the ground, crying out in pain.\nVictoria stared in surprise at William, who had stepped in front of her, stunned.\nThe man struggled to get up, pointing at William and cursing, \"You bastard! How dare you hit me! I'll kill you!\"\nHe swung his fist at William, but he was no match. William easily knocked him down again.\nThe man lay on the ground, groaning, spitting blood, and glaring at William.\nWilliam sneered, looking down at him. \"What's wrong? Weren't you going to kill me? Go on, then!\"\nVictoria watched William fight, feeling no concern, only annoyance.\nShe walked into the coffee shop, bought a cup of coffee for the woman, and handed it to her.\nThe woman looked at the coffee, her eyes welling up with tears. \"Thank you,\" she choked out.\nWilliam approached.\nHarry would take care of the rest.\nVictoria acted as if she didn't see him, walking past him.\nAs she took a step, William grabbed her arm, pulling her into a secluded corner.\nVictoria struggled angrily, but she couldn't budge him.\n\"Mr. Scott, let go of me!\"\n\"Did you sleep with Samuel?\" William demanded through gritted teeth.",

        "content": "\"Does it even matter to you?\" Victoria shot him a glare, her teeth clenched.\nWilliam felt a sharp pang in his chest as she didn't deny it, his eyes instantly welling up.\nIt was like his heart was being sliced apart with a dull knife, the pain unbearable.\nVictoria looked at him coldly, her tone dripping with sarcasm. \"Didn't you always say I was a whore who'd sell herself for money? I'm just doing what you said. Why are you acting all hurt now? Isn't it ridiculous?\"\nWilliam stared at her, feeling a deep, festering pain in the most hidden part of his heart.\nHe silently watched her.\nShe was clearly thinner than before, but her eyes were still clear and bright, filled with a stubbornness.\nThis was the girl he loved, and also the one he had hurt the most.\n\"Are you doing this to get back at me?\" he murmured softly.\n\"Don't flatter yourself. Do you think I'd ruin myself for you? Samuel is a thousand times, no, ten thousand times better than you!\" Victoria shot back mockingly.\nWilliam felt a mix of pain and bitterness in his heart. He clenched his fists, enduring the tearing pain inside, and asked again, \"Victoria, I admit I started out to get back at your father, but later...\"\n\"Shut up!\" Victoria lost control, screaming to cut him off, her eyes cold and filled with hatred. \"Haven't you bullied me enough? Why are you still bothering me?\"\nWilliam fell silent immediately, staring at her in a daze. He opened his mouth, wanting to explain, but his throat was so dry he couldn't form a complete sentence.\nWhat should he say? What could he say? Should he say he really loved her? He was afraid she would hate him even more.\nAfter a long silence, he suddenly grabbed Victoria's shoulders tightly, almost begging, \"What do I have to do for you to forgive me?\"\nVictoria winced in pain from his grip and desperately shook off William's hold. \"William, I won't forgive you unless you die!\"\nWith that, she turned and ran away, her eyes quickly filling with tears, but she didn't want them to fall.\nWilliam stood there in a daze, feeling as if his heart had been hollowed out, the emptiness suffocating him.\nVictoria ran all the way home, only to find Nora squatting at the door, yelling at the house. \"Victoria, I'm your mother! How dare you not let me in?\"\n\"Victoria, are you getting too cocky? Do you think you can ignore me?\"\n\"Get out here right now!\"\n\"Victoria, if you don't come out, don't blame me for being rude!\"\nHer voice echoed through the neighborhood, and the neighbors peeked out, whispering among themselves.\nVictoria walked up helplessly. \"Mom, what are you doing?\"\nNora stood up and slapped Victoria across the face, scolding, \"How dare you ask me why? I've called you so many times, and you didn't answer once! Do you even see me as your mother?\"\nVictoria covered her swollen cheek, looking down. \"Sorry, I didn't hear it.\"\nNora was about to continue scolding her, but Victoria had already taken out her keys and opened the door.\nNora didn't bother causing more trouble and immediately walked into the yard. As soon as she entered the house, she started shouting, \"Where's your dad? What's he doing? He never answers my calls.\"\n\"He's out of the country,\" Victoria replied indifferently.\nNora's interest was piqued. \"Out of the country? What's he doing, business?\"\nAlthough she had always disliked Alvin's gentle, unmanly demeanor, she had to admit he had a good business mind.\nStarting from scratch, in just over a decade, he had turned a small design company into a top national enterprise. It was a miracle!\nVictoria glanced at her. \"How would I know what he's doing?\"\nHearing this, Nora angrily twisted her ear, scolding, \"You little brat, how dare you talk to me like that? Do you believe I'll beat you to death?\"\nVictoria winced in pain and pushed her away. \"I warn you, if you touch me again, I'll have the property management kick you out. This house is mine now.\"\n\"You!\" Nora pointed at her nose, her chest heaving with anger.\nThough she was full of bluster, she didn't dare use violence again.\nShe knew that Victoria was indeed capable of doing it now.\nVictoria pushed out a large suitcase and coldly said to Nora, \"I've packed your clothes and other things. I'll call a car to take you to a hotel.\"\n\"I have a home. Why should I stay in a hotel?\" Nora said nonchalantly, walking to the sofa and sitting down gracefully.\nShe patted the empty spot beside her, signaling Victoria to sit too. \"Victoria, I know you have issues with me, but that's all in the past. Now that your dad is out of prison, our family can finally be together again. We should look forward, not dwell on the past.\"\nVictoria emphasized each word, \"This home is mine and Dad's!\"\nNora laughed, a hint of smugness in her eyes. \"Have you asked him? Did he say he doesn't want to get back together with me?\"\nVictoria was stunned. She hadn't actually asked Alvin about his thoughts.\nSeeing her reaction, Nora became even more smug, shaking her head slightly. \"It's all your assumption. How could you understand our feelings? Your dad and I have been on and off for years. This is just how we are. You have no right to decide for him.\"\nVictoria's face turned cold, and she retorted mercilessly, \"You abandoned him.\"\n\"But he doesn't care! Just wait until he comes back and ask him if he still has feelings for me. Without me, he can't live.\" Nora smiled, getting up to grab Victoria's hand. Victoria instinctively stepped back, her eyes full of unfamiliarity and wariness.\n\"Victoria, let me give you some advice. Your dad loves me very much. Don't let your selfishness keep us apart. You might face some bad karma.\" With that, Nora yawned, took her pajamas from the suitcase, and went to the bathroom to take a shower.\n\"Don't call me for dinner,\" Nora added.\nVictoria stood there, feeling helpless and wronged.\nAfter a while, she slowly walked to the sofa, took out her phone, and dialed Alvin's number.\nThe phone rang for a long time before it was answered. \"Victoria.\"\nThe background noise on Alvin's end sounded very loud and chaotic; it seemed like he was in a place like a bar.\nVictoria frowned and asked, \"Dad, where are you now?\"\nAlvin's voice came nervously, \"Victoria, I'm busy. You should go to bed early. I'll be back in a few days.\"\nVictoria obediently agreed and was about to hang up when she suddenly heard Daisy's scream on the other end of the line.",

        "content": "As soon as Alvin stepped into the bar in Xandria, he was hit by a mix of smoke, alcohol, spices, and stifling heat.\nThe bar was dimly lit, with flickering lights and music that had a strong exotic vibe. The heavy drumbeats seemed to sync with his heartbeat.\nA few local businessmen walked ahead of him, their faces full of arrogance, heads held high. One of them said, \"There are plenty of companies wanting to work with us. What makes you think we'd choose your small company?\"\nAlvin followed behind them, his brow furrowed, unwilling to give up. He pleaded, \"Efren...\"\n\"Enough, we'll talk about this later,\" the man called Efren said impatiently, waving his hand dismissively. His thick arm pushed Alvin aside with a rough shove.\nThe disdain on Efren's face was unmistakable, showing no respect as he turned and led his group towards a private room.\nAlvin stood there alone, clutching the proposal he had poured his heart and soul into, his knuckles white from the pressure.\nHe slowly turned around, the weight of defeat heavy on his face.\nAs he looked up, he saw Daisy sitting by the bar not far away.\nDaisy was wearing a tight, crimson dress that accentuated her curves.\nHer makeup was meticulously done, exuding a cold, fierce beauty. In this exotic and alluring bar, she was like a blooming rose with thorns, radiating a dangerous yet captivating charm.\nDaisy noticed him too, and didn't avoid his gaze. She watched him with a calm, detached look.\nJust then, a tall man in a flashy shirt and a thick gold chain approached Daisy, speaking with a heavy accent, \"Miss, are you alone?\"\nDaisy didn't respond immediately. She raised an elegant eyebrow and a faint smile played on her lips, like a lazy yet regal cat, making her even more enticing.\nBefore she could reply, the man was abruptly pulled aside. \"She's not alone.\"\nDaisy's smile deepened, her eyes still fixed on Alvin.\nThe man was about to protest, but seeing the burly bodyguards behind Daisy, he backed off and left dejectedly.\nAlvin walked over and sat across from Daisy, casually picking up a drink and downing it. \"What are you doing here?\"\nDaisy's slender fingers gently held her wine glass, swirling the red liquid inside.\nShe spoke softly, \"Just relaxing, and maybe finding someone to spend the night with. You just scared off a decent prospect. How are you going to make it up to me?\"\nAlvin stared at her silently for a moment, then looked away, his voice tinged with weariness. \"Xandria is too chaotic, full of all kinds of people. It's not safe for you. You should go back.\"\n\"If you can handle it, why can't I?\" Daisy raised an eyebrow, a hint of defiance in her tone.\n\"I'm not like you,\" Alvin paused, then continued, \"Here, they still have some fear of me.\"\n\"Perfect, with you as my 'guardian angel,' I have nothing to worry about,\" Daisy said, standing up and tossing her small purse to him. \"I'm hungry. Take me to get something to eat.\"\nAlvin frowned, looking troubled. \"I still have business to discuss.\"\nDaisy turned back, giving him a charming smile and a playful wink. \"There are other ways to negotiate besides pestering. Come on.\"\nDaisy and Alvin went missing in Xandria.\nVictoria received the news while she was organizing art books in the gallery.\nThe shock nearly made her faint on the spot.\nThankfully, Wendy was there to catch her.\nAfter taking leave, she was about to rush home to pack when she found William's car already parked outside.\nVictoria, setting aside their past grievances, urgently asked, \"What happened? Why did they suddenly disappear?\"\nWilliam's lips were pressed into a thin line, his face icy. \"I don't know the details, but according to Aunt Daisy's bodyguards, they went to meet someone in a private room at a bar and never came out.\"\nVictoria's heart sank.\nSeeing her pale face and red eyes, William's heart ached. He softly reassured her, \"Don't worry. Aunt Daisy and Alvin will be fine. I'm heading to Xandria now to bring them back.\"\n\"I'm coming with you!\" Victoria insisted.\n\"No way!\" William refused without hesitation.\nXandria was a dangerous place, overrun by gangs. Human life there was worth nothing.\nHe couldn't let Victoria take that risk.\n\"William, please, let me go with you. I'm so scared. I'm worried something will happen to them. Please take me with you.\"\nSeeing her pleading expression, William finally relented. \"You can come, but you must stay within my sight.\"\nVictoria nodded repeatedly.\nWilliam sighed, \"Go pack. I'll arrange the tickets.\"\nNora was in the living room with a face mask on, a plate of fruit and a glass of fresh juice in front of her.\nHer surgery had been postponed, and her health was still precarious. But she always took care of herself, and lately, she had been indulging in expensive supplements and imported fruits.\nSeeing Victoria return, Nora quickly removed her mask and rushed over to block her path. \"Why are you home early?\"\nVictoria, consumed with worry, had no time for her. She pushed past Nora and headed upstairs.\n\"I'm talking to you!\" Nora, hands on her hips, glared after her, chest heaving with anger.\nSoon, Victoria came back down.\n\"Stop right there!\" Nora grabbed Victoria's arm, her face livid. \"Is this how you treat me? Do you want me to expose your secrets?\"\n\"Go ahead!\"\nVictoria shook her off angrily. \"If you don't mind the shame, why should I? Expose away!\"\nHer shout stunned Nora, who stared at her in shock.\nNora noticed the items Victoria was packing.\nShe snatched them away. \"What's this?\"\n\"Give it back!\" Victoria reached for it, but Nora had already stepped back onto the stairs. Seeing it was a passport, she looked suspicious. \"What do you need this for?\"",

Her face showed increasing panic. \"Are you planning to leave this family? Are you going to abandon me?\"\nOnce this thought crossed her mind, Nora became frantic.\nShe knew how much Alvin adored Victoria. She had just managed to move back in, and if Victoria left, wouldn't Alvin leave too?\nSuddenly, she turned and bolted for the door. \"Without this, let's see where you can go!\"\n\"Give it to me!\" Victoria, both angry and anxious, hurried after her to snatch back the passport.\nNora, already frail, hadn't even reached the door before she clutched her chest, gasping for breath.\nSeeing Victoria coming to grab it, she clung to the passport tightly. \"No, I won't give it to you!\"\nNot only that, she pushed Victoria hard. \"I'm telling you, no matter where you go, you can't shake me off!\"\nVictoria stumbled back a few steps and fell to the ground.\nSuddenly, the door was kicked open!\nWilliam appeared in the doorway.\nSeeing someone enter, Nora quickly scrambled up from the floor.\nWilliam, with a dark expression, strode towards her.\n\"Ah! You...\" Nora, terrified of William, dropped the passport and ran to a corner, hiding behind the curtains, trembling.\nWilliam bent down, picked up the passport, dusted it off, and handed it to Victoria.\nVictoria took it and stuffed it into her bag, quickly heading for the door. \"Let's go!\"\nWilliam said nothing, turned, and left.\nIt wasn't until she heard the car outside that Nora dared to come out.\nShe slowly walked to the door, suspiciously watching the direction they left.\nWhere were they going?\nLeaving in such a hurry, and with passports?\nSuddenly, Nora's eyes widened. Were they eloping?\nThe car sped down the road.\nWhen they arrived at the airport, Harry was already there, handing William his passport and ticket. \"Mr. Scott, everything is arranged.\"\n\"Good.\" William took them without looking and handed them to Victoria.\nVictoria instinctively caught them and checked the ticket. It was for the next available flight.\nHe walked ahead, and Victoria quickly followed, asking Harry, \"Why are there only two tickets? Aren't you coming?\"\n\"I need to stay and handle some matters at the company. I'll join you later.\"\nVictoria nodded slightly.\nBut she couldn't help feeling a bit uneasy. So, they would be spending all their time together?\nBefore boarding, Victoria went to a corner and called Wendy, giving her some work instructions.\nThen she called Samuel.\n\"Xandria? That's too dangerous! I don't feel comfortable with you going alone! But I can't leave right now. Can you wait for a day? I'll go with you tomorrow.\"\n\"Samuel, I'm not going alone.\" Victoria hesitated but felt there was no need to hide it. \"I'm going with William. His aunt and my father are involved.\"\nShe looked up, seeing William standing a respectful distance away, not too close to invade her privacy but not too far either.\nMany people around were looking at him, and some girls were secretly taking pictures with their phones.\nOn the other end, Samuel was silent for a moment before saying, \"I understand.\"\nVictoria slowly turned around, holding her phone, and said softly, \"Samuel, don't overthink it. We're just traveling together for the same purpose.\"\n\"Are you worried I'll be upset?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Victoria admitted. \"You're my boyfriend now. I have to consider your feelings in everything I do.\"\nSamuel chuckled. \"Don't worry about me. I won't overthink it. Just take care of yourself. Once I get permission from the school, I'll come find you.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nIn the bustling airport lounge, people hurried by.\nVictoria stood by the large window, staring blankly at the planes taking off and landing, clutching her ticket so tightly her fingers turned white.\nWilliam watched her, frowning, wanting to say something but stopping himself. Finally, he just sighed softly.\nThe boarding announcement came over the speakers. Victoria took a deep breath and walked towards the gate, with William following closely behind.\nThey hadn't spoken much since the initial exchange, and the atmosphere was cold and distant.\nIn the first-class cabin, the spacious and comfortable environment and the attentive service did nothing to improve Victoria's mood.\nWhen she saw the two adjacent seats, she stopped abruptly, not wanting to sit too close to William.\nShe bit her lip and decisively approached a busy flight attendant, softly asking, \"Excuse me, could I change my seat?\"\nThe flight attendant smiled professionally and quickly made the arrangements.\nWilliam watched her with a blank expression, his eyes darkening.\nHe looked at her profile for a long time before looking away and sitting in his seat.\nVictoria sat in her new seat by the window, looking out at the blue sky. But her mind was filled with worry, fear, and anxiety, leaving no room to appreciate the view.\nAlvin had just come back to her. What would she do if something happened to him?\nThe thought made her shiver, her head spinning as if the whole world was turning upside down.\nShe closed her eyes, forcing herself to calm down and not jump to conclusions.\nBut her red-rimmed eyes and trembling hands betrayed her true emotions.\nWilliam noticed every detail.\nIn that moment, he wanted to go over and hold her, to comfort her.\nBut she hated him so much now, she wouldn't accept his kindness.\nWilliam smiled bitterly and lowered his eyes.\nAfter a while, there was movement in the seat next to Victoria.\nShe turned instinctively and saw a strikingly handsome man.\nThe man was tall and well-built, with sun-kissed skin exuding a wild charm, as if he carried the scent of sunshine and the wilderness.\nHis chiseled features looked like they had been meticulously sculpted, with sharp eyebrows, a high nose, and slightly upturned lips that hinted at a rebellious streak.\nA silver earring in his left ear glinted coldly, and a faint scar on his brow added a touch of mystery and danger to his allure.\nAs soon as he sat down, his gaze fell on Victoria, a flash of admiration in his eyes.\nVictoria, in a hurry, had only changed out of her work clothes into a beige dress that perfectly outlined her graceful curves.\nHer smooth hair fell over her shoulders, and her clear skin, paired with her elegant attire, made her look even more delicate and radiant.\nShe was already beautiful, but with tears in her eyes, she looked even more pitiful and heart-wrenching.\nThe man raised an eyebrow, looking at her with interest, his deep voice resonating. \"Miss, do you need any help?\"",

He continued to smile warmly, \"Xandria can be a bit unstable. I'm Louie Hopper, kind of known around here. When we're away from home, we're all friends. If you need any help, just ask. It's fate that we're sitting together.\"\nAs he spoke, he extended his hand, seemingly wanting to shake hands with Victoria.\nVictoria's internal alarm bells rang. She subtly pulled her hand back, just about to refuse when William appeared beside her.\nHe crouched down in front of Victoria, looking into her eyes with a mock scolding tone, \"How long are you gonna stay mad? Come on, don't be like this.\"\nHis tone was like that of a boyfriend trying to make up after a small argument, affectionate yet slightly helpless.\nVictoria was about to retort, but when she met William's slightly warning gaze, the words caught in her throat.\nLouie observed the interaction with a faint smile, then casually played with his phone on the table.\nWilliam wrapped his arm around Victoria's waist, gently coaxing, \"Okay, I was wrong. When we land, I'll buy you a gift to make up for it, alright?\"\nLouie watched them with a dark, unreadable expression for a few seconds before returning to his lazy demeanor.\nVictoria responded stiffly, then turned away, ignoring him.\nWilliam didn't get angry and smoothly returned to his seat.\nThe plane flew steadily through the clouds. Victoria sat by the window, her gaze lost in the distance, her thoughts far away.\nSuddenly, the plane jolted violently without warning. Trays, magazines, and other items scattered, and passengers screamed in panic.\nVictoria was thrown forward, but Louie quickly grabbed her, preventing her from hitting the seat in front.\nShe gasped for breath and thanked him gratefully.\nWilliam frowned, glancing over but said nothing.\nVictoria took a deep breath, trying to calm herself.\nLouie, sitting next to her, looked surprised.\nThis seemingly delicate girl had quite the courage!\nSoon, the turbulence subsided, and the plane gradually stabilized.\nAfter a long flight, the plane finally landed at Xandria's airport.\nAs the cabin door opened, a wave of humid heat greeted them.\nVictoria stood up, straightened her slightly disheveled clothes, and prepared to disembark.\nLouie also stood up, taking out his phone and smiling at Victoria, \"Miss, can I get your contact info? If you run into any trouble in Xandria, feel free to reach out.\"\nWilliam pulled Victoria into his arms, protectively holding her.\nHe glared at Louie with a cold expression, \"Hitting on someone else's girlfriend isn't very polite, is it?\"\nLouie shrugged, \"Just making friends, no need to be so tense.\"\nWilliam was about to say more, but Victoria tugged at him, politely declining, \"Thanks for the offer, but I'll manage on my own.\"\nShe didn't want to get involved with strangers in this unfamiliar and complex place.\nLouie wasn't offended. He shrugged and smiled even brighter, \"Alright, see you around.\"\nWith that, he turned and blended into the crowd.\nVictoria and William dragged their luggage out of the airport.\nA black luxury car was already waiting outside. The driver saw them and immediately approached, respectfully taking their luggage and opening the car door, \"Mr. Scott, Ms. Carter, welcome.\"\nVictoria was surprised to learn that the Scott family had a branch here, their influence far greater than she had imagined.\nOnce in the car, it smoothly headed towards their destination.\nThrough the window, Victoria saw the unfamiliar yet exotic scenery, her emotions mixed.\nThey remained silent until the car stopped in front of a well-known local resort.\nWilliam led Victoria into the resort, where the rich Xandria ambiance hit them instantly.\nThe lobby's high ceiling, with its intricate wooden beams and hanging wicker lamps, cast a warm, soft glow on the polished teak floor, creating a play of light and shadow.\nWilliam walked confidently to the front desk, conversed with the staff, and soon received a room key.\nVictoria noticed he had only booked one room and frowned, about to protest.\nWilliam, anticipating her reaction, quickly stepped forward and gently pulled her into his arms.\nVictoria instinctively struggled but stopped when he whispered in her ear, his warm breath tickling her, \"Not here. We'll talk in the room.\"\nReluctantly, she stayed quiet, letting William hold her as they entered the elevator.\nThe elevator stopped on the eighth floor with a soft ding, and the doors opened.\nWilliam carried Victoria straight into the room.\nThe spacious presidential suite was a blend of luxury and local charm.\nA vibrant handwoven rug covered the floor, soft to the touch. In the center stood a large carved teak bed, draped with airy, flowing curtains.\nThere was also a large indoor hot spring bath, its edges inlaid with colorful glass tiles, steam rising invitingly.\nA set of exquisite pewter tea ware and a plate of fresh, sliced fruit sat on the coffee table.\nAs soon as they entered, Victoria pushed William away, her eyes cold, \"Why only one room?\"\nHe raised an eyebrow, nonchalantly asking, \"What, afraid I'll eat you up?\"\nVictoria gritted her teeth, \"Regardless, I have a boyfriend. It's inappropriate for us to stay together.\"\nWilliam felt a pang in his heart but quickly composed himself.\nHe didn't respond, instead taking a small, sophisticated device from his luggage and began scanning the room.\nVictoria sat silently, watching his actions.\nSoon, the device emitted a few soft beeps, and William's expression darkened.\nHe pointed to a potted plant in the corner, the TV frame, and the lampshade by the bed, speaking quietly to Victoria, \"Look, here, and here, there are hidden cameras.\"",

        "content": "Victoria followed the direction of his finger, and a shiver ran down her spine as fear washed over her.\nWilliam walked over, his expression softening a bit, and his tone gentler. \"Xandria's got its dangers, and we don't have many options right now. For the next few days, we'll have to make do. You can take the bed, and I'll crash on the couch, okay?\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together and stayed silent for a moment.\nFinally, she nodded, agreeing to his plan.\nSeeing her willingness to cooperate, William let out a sigh of relief.\nHe walked over to the balcony and checked his watch. \"Get some rest. I'm heading out to look for clues about Aunt Daisy and your dad. If you get too restless, you can walk around the resort, but don't wander too far.\"\nAs he spoke, he pulled a piece of paper from his pocket with a phone number written on it and handed it to Victoria. \"This is Quinton's number. He's the driver waiting outside the resort. If anything happens, call him right away.\"\nVictoria hesitated for a moment before nodding lightly.\nWilliam looked at her still distant and cold expression, feeling a slight pang in his heart.\nHe turned to leave, but Victoria suddenly called out to him, her voice still icy but with a hint of concern if one listened closely. \"Be careful.\"\nWilliam froze at her words.\nWith his back to Victoria, his eyes were deep and unreadable, but a faint smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.\nHe turned to look at her, his gaze filled with unspoken words, but he only said softly, \"Wait for me to come back.\"\nVictoria nodded, saying nothing more.\nAfter William left, the room fell into a heavy silence.\nAlone in the room, every minute felt like an eternity, and the quiet made her increasingly anxious and restless.\nTwo hours later, unable to sit still any longer, she decided to take a walk around the resort to clear her mind.\nThe resort's wooden walkways twisted and turned, tall palm trees swayed in the breeze, and their large leaves rustled softly.\nNot far away, the surface of the outdoor pool shimmered, with a few wicker lounge chairs scattered around, colorful cushions casually tossed on them, exuding a lazy, relaxed vibe.\nHowever, Victoria was too anxious to appreciate the beautiful scenery.\nShe wanted to call William to ask if there was any news, but she was afraid of disturbing him.\nShe sighed and decided to head back to her room to wait.\nIn the distance, she noticed a small figure.\nIt was a cute girl who looked about seventeen or eighteen, struggling to push a large basket of fruit. The basket was clearly too heavy for her, and as she stumbled, the fruit spilled everywhere.\nSeeing this, Victoria felt a pang of sympathy.\nShe hesitated for a moment before walking over to help pick up the fruit.\nThe girl looked up at her, her bright eyes blinking, and smiled. \"Thanks! Are you from Crystalia?\"\nVictoria nodded lightly. \"Yeah.\"\nThe girl's eyes lit up instantly, and she beamed. \"I'm Giselle Hopper, I work here. What's your name?\"\nVictoria smiled. \"I'm Victoria.\"\nGiselle nodded enthusiastically. \"Nice to meet you, Victoria! I'm taking these fruits to the kitchen. Enjoy your time here!\"\n\"Okay.\" Victoria nodded, watching Giselle leave.\nAfter parting ways with Giselle, Victoria walked back the way she came.\nSuddenly, two young men with tattoos blocked her path.\nOne of them, a red-haired guy named Jett, leered at her chest and grinned. \"Hey, miss, how much for a night?\"\nDid he think she was a prostitute?\nVictoria glared at Jett in disgust, said nothing, and tried to walk past them.\nThe other guy, with a buzz cut, named Hayden, blocked her way, his beady eyes fixed on her legs. \"Hey, miss, you're from Crystalia, right? So am I. How about a drink? I promise you'll have a great time.\"\nVictoria was both shocked and furious, her cheeks flushing red. She clenched her fists and shouted, \"Get lost!\"\n\"Feisty, huh?\" Hayden rubbed his hands together, a sleazy smile on his face. \"I like feisty women. They're wild!\" He reached out to grab her chest.\nVictoria stepped back quickly, avoiding his hand.\nSeeing this, Hayden got even more excited. \"You dare to resist? Do you know who I am? I'm with The Raven Syndicate. Piss me off, and I'll kill you.\"\nHe laughed lewdly. \"Tonight, I'll show you what a real man is.\"\nEnraged, Victoria slapped him hard across the face.\nThe sharp sound of the slap echoed, and everything went silent.\nHayden clutched his swollen cheek, stunned for a moment, then flew into a rage. He grabbed Victoria by the collar and lifted her up, cursing. \"You bitch! Don't you know what's good for you? I'll rape you right now!\"\nVictoria struggled, her head spinning and her breath coming in gasps.\nHayden's grip was too strong, and she couldn't break free.\nJust as she felt she was about to suffocate, a strong hand suddenly grabbed Hayden's wrist and pried it open.\nIn the next moment, William yanked Hayden's hand off Victoria and kicked him hard.\nHayden screamed and fell to the ground like a broken kite.\nJett, seeing this, tried to fight back, but William dodged his punch and delivered a sharp elbow to his face, sending Jett to the ground, clutching his nose in pain.\nWilliam glared at them coldly. \"Keep your hands to yourselves, or I'll break them.\"\nJett groaned in pain, then got up, gritting his teeth. \"Fine! You're tough! Just you wait!\"\nWith that, he turned and ran.\nWilliam quickly moved to Victoria's side, shielding her behind him, his voice trembling with anger. \"Are you okay?\"\nVictoria, still shaken, shook her head, her eyes filled with fear and relief.\n\"Let's go back.\" William held her hand tightly.\nVictoria hesitated, glancing in the direction the men had fled. \"They won't come back, will they?\"\nWilliam patted her shoulder reassuringly. \"Don't worry. I'll handle it.\"\nVictoria bit her lip and whispered, \"Thank you.\"\nWilliam led her back to the room.\nOnce inside, he went straight to the bathroom, cleaned up, and changed his clothes before coming out.\nVictoria stood by the window, watching him intently.\nDespite her lingering resentment and anger towards him, she felt an unexpected sense of security and calm when she looked at him.\nWhen he emerged, Victoria couldn't contain her anxiety any longer. She stepped forward and asked, \"Did you find any clues while you were out?\"\nWilliam looked at her, his expression serious. \"I found some information. My aunt and your father were caught in a gang fight while negotiating a deal. Your father fought to protect my aunt and injured some people. Those people belong to the biggest gang in Xandria. They were captured.\"",

        "content": "Hearing this, Victoria's mind raced with anxiety.\nThe Xandria mob-those guys were ruthless, cold-blooded killers!\nVictoria instinctively grabbed William's arm. \"What do we do? Do they want money? I can sell my villa right now if it helps.\"\nShe was so terrified that she could barely form a coherent sentence.\nWilliam frowned, holding her hand in return. \"Don't panic. This started because of my aunt. If it's just money they want, I'll pay whatever it takes. I've already sent someone to negotiate with their leader. We should have news by tomorrow.\"\nVictoria exhaled deeply, trying to control her emotions and stopped asking questions.\nWhen she finally calmed down, she noticed that William was still holding her hand. His palm was warm and dry.\nShe quickly pulled her hand back, her face pale. \"Thanks for helping with my dad.\"\nWilliam looked at her for a moment, then composed himself and said calmly, \"You're welcome. You must be hungry. Let me take you to get something to eat.\"\nVictoria wanted to refuse but knew that if she didn't eat properly, she wouldn't be able to help rescue Alvin and might even become a burden to William.\nShe pressed her lips together and nodded in agreement.\nNightfall in Xandria always came suddenly. Just after six, the sky was already enveloped in thick darkness.\nWilliam and Victoria went to a nearby restaurant.\nThey had just sat down when William's phone rang. He glanced at the screen and stood up. \"You go ahead and order. I need to take this call.\"\n\"Okay,\" Victoria replied softly.\nThrough the window, Victoria could see William standing under a streetlamp, talking on the phone.\nThe dim light stretched his figure, and he occasionally rubbed his forehead, clearly troubled by the conversation.\nThe streets of Xandria were bustling with activity, filled with people from all walks of life.\nStreet vendors in traditional attire loudly hawked various snacks and handmade goods, while many foreign tourists, with large backpacks, excitedly took photos.\nWilliam stood tall and handsome under the streetlamp, drawing the attention of many passersby, both women and men.\nSeeing William's impatient responses, Victoria momentarily forgot their past grievances and her current worries, a slight smile tugging at her lips.\nWilliam turned and caught sight of her smile, a softness appearing in his eyes.\nIt had been a long time since he had seen her smile.\nVictoria noticed his gaze, and her smile froze. She quickly looked away, avoiding his eyes.\nWilliam felt a dull ache in his chest. He looked away and walked back into the restaurant.\nJust then, a man approached Victoria with a fawning smile. \"Miss, are you here for sightseeing too?\"\n\"I am...\" Victoria began to explain.\nThe restaurant door swung open, and William strode in.\nHe stepped in front of Victoria, giving the man a cold look. \"Is there a problem?\"\n\"No, no problem. Sorry to bother you.\" The man quickly realized William was not to be trifled with and scurried away.\nWilliam sat down, picking up his utensils, and said seriously to Victoria, \"Xandria is a chaotic place. Be very careful when strangers approach you.\"\nHe looked at her intently. \"Here, some people might be after more than just your money or your pretty face. They might want...\"\nHe paused, lowering his voice, \"your organs.\"\nVictoria felt a chill run down her spine, fear gripping her.\nBefore coming to Xandria, she had heard about the dangers, but experiencing it firsthand was far more terrifying than she had imagined.\nSeeing her fear, William's tone softened slightly. \"Don't worry. As long as I'm here, I won't let anyone hurt you.\"\nVictoria looked up at William and nodded silently.\nThe food arrived, filling the table with local dishes.\nBut Victoria had no appetite. She tried a few bites, but the strong spices and unfamiliar flavors were hard to swallow.\nSeeing this, William frowned and, without a word, got up and headed to the kitchen.\nA short while later, he returned with a steaming bowl of spaghetti.\nVictoria stared at the spaghetti in surprise, then looked at William suspiciously. \"Do they serve this here?\"\nWilliam, hiding his slightly burned hands behind his back, said calmly, \"I asked the chef to make it. It looks pretty good.\"\nVictoria blinked, then hesitantly took a bite.\nThe rich tomato flavor filled her mouth, the pasta was tender and smooth, and the delicious taste spread across her tongue. She couldn't help but take another bite.\nWilliam watched her eat with satisfaction, a small smile playing on his lips.\nAfter dinner, they returned to their room.\nAs soon as they entered, Victoria's phone rang. She saw it was Samuel.\nWilliam noticed too, his expression darkening instantly.\nThat Samuel, always lurking around.\nHe stood aside, arms crossed, watching Victoria intently.\nVictoria walked to the window, turning slightly to avoid William's gaze, and answered the call.\nBefore she could speak, Samuel's gentle, concerned voice came through. \"Victoria, how are you? Are you okay?\"\nHearing his familiar, warm voice, Victoria's facade of strength crumbled, her eyes reddening. It took her a moment to choke out, \"I'm fine.\"\nSamuel sensed something was wrong and quickly asked, \"Victoria, are you crying?\"\nHearing Samuel's voice, Victoria's nose tingled with emotion.\nShe tried to control her feelings, sniffing. \"No, I'm just a bit tired.\"\nSamuel comforted her softly, \"Don't be scared. I'll fly over in a few days to be with you. Which city are you in?\"\nVictoria hesitated, not wanting to involve Samuel. \"No need, Samuel. Really, don't trouble yourself. We have a lead, and we should be able to return in a few days. Don't worry.\"\nSamuel understood she didn't want him to come and sighed, giving in. \"Alright, but take care of yourself. Call me if you need anything, okay?\"\n\"Okay, don't worry.\" Victoria hung up and was about to wipe her tears.\nBefore she could react, a strong hand grabbed her neck, pressing her against the wall.\nVictoria's eyes widened in shock, seeing William's jealous face inches from hers.\n\"William, what are you doing?\" Victoria struggled in fear.\nWilliam ignored her, leaning in and kissing her fiercely.",

        "content": "Victoria's eyes widened in panic as she desperately tried to fend off William's aggressive advances. How could she possibly match his brute strength? The more she resisted, the more forceful he became.\nMaybe it was because it had been so long since he had been close to her, but William's kiss was wild and rough, like he was venting some deep-seated frustration.\nVictoria had no choice but to endure, pounding on his chest with all her might, but he remained unmoved.\nIt wasn't until she gradually lost the strength to fight back that he finally let her go.\nLooking at Victoria's tear-streaked face and labored breathing, William's voice was low and hoarse, tinged with a barely perceptible hint of grievance. \"Don't you dare cry for another man. Here, I'm the one you should rely on.\"\nA sudden slap landed on his face, catching him off guard. Victoria bit her lip hard, glaring at William with hatred.\nWilliam clutched his burning left cheek, staring at her in stunned silence for a long moment.\n\"Get out!\" Victoria pointed to the door, her voice a furious roar. \"Get out of here! Now! Immediately!\"\nHer emotions were spiraling out of control, her eyes red and brimming with tears.\nShe despised him.\nShe didn't want to see him.\n\"William, you're nothing but a complete liar!\" Victoria screamed hysterically. \"You deceived me from the start. You got my father thrown in jail, then came back with money to humiliate me! You treated me like a clown for your amusement. Is that fun for you?\"\nEach of Victoria's accusations was like a needle, stabbing into William's heart.\nHe looked at her, his heart aching. \"Victoria, I don't expect you to forgive me, but I truly care about you. Please, believe me.\"\nAs he spoke, he reached out to grasp her slender arm, trying to close the distance between them.\nVictoria angrily shook off his touch, glaring at him with fury. \"You care about me? What do you care about? That I'm young, that I'm naive, easy to mess with?\"\nWilliam opened his mouth, but he didn't know how to explain.\nShould he tell her he admired her kindness and simplicity, her strength and courage, her ability to stay optimistic despite her scars, her independence, and her clear sense of right and wrong?\nNo matter what he said now, she wouldn't believe a word.\nSeeing his silence, Victoria's anger flared even more, and she spoke without thinking. \"William, I'm starting to think my dad and your aunt's disappearance was just another one of your tricks to mess with me. You can't stand to see me happy, can you? You have to ruin my life to feel satisfied, don't you?\"\nWilliam hadn't expected her to doubt him so deeply. Her hurtful words completely enraged him.\nHis eyes turned cold and resolute, a self-mocking smile playing on his lips. \"If you think I'm that despicable, then I'll show you just how despicable I can be. After all, if you'll spread your legs for him, what's one more time with me?\"\nVictoria's body went rigid, her eyes wide with disbelief.\nShe never imagined William would say something so vile.\nBefore she could recover from the shock, William scooped her up and carried her to the hot spring pool in the suite, unceremoniously tossing her in.\nWater splashed everywhere as Victoria fell in, her clothes soaking through instantly.\nWilliam looked down at her with a sneer, his voice dripping with cruelty. \"You called me despicable, so I'll show you despicable.\"\nWithout waiting for her consent, he stepped into the pool, pinning Victoria against the wall.\nThe warm water enveloped most of their bodies. Victoria trembled all over, her hatred for him growing stronger, but she couldn't break free from his grip.\nWilliam held her arms, pinning her hands above her head, then lowered his head to lick her flushed earlobe.\nVictoria struggled violently, twisting her waist, trying to push him away.\n\"William, you bastard! Let me go!\"\nWilliam ignored her, his breath hot against her neck, sending shivers down her spine. Victoria couldn't help but tremble.\nWilliam's lips trailed down her body, his movements gentle and slow, as if handling a rare treasure.\nVictoria's mind went blank for a second, then she fought back with all her might, but it was futile.\nWilliam's large hand slipped under her clothes, caressing her soft skin.\nVictoria glared at him with wide eyes, filled with disgust.\nHer look of hatred only spurred William on, his hand squeezing her breast harder.\n\"It hurts, let me go!\" Victoria groaned in pain, her eyes quickly filling with tears.\n\"Let me go, William, let me go! It hurts!\"\nTears streamed down her face as she curled up, trying to escape his hold.\n\"Good, it should hurt.\" William whispered in her ear, his voice filled with anguish. \"Do you know how much it hurt me to find out you slept with Samuel? I wanted to kill him, then myself.\"\nVictoria instinctively wanted to deny it. \"I didn't...\"\nBut she stopped herself. Why should she explain anything to him?\nShe wanted him to suffer as much as possible.\nVictoria clamped her mouth shut, refusing to say another word, glaring at him with hatred.\nHer defiance only fueled William's anger.\nHe roughly kissed her swollen lips, biting down hard.\nVictoria's body instinctively recoiled, trying to get away from him.\nSeeing her continued resistance, William grabbed a piece of fabric from the poolside, tearing off a strip to bind her hands.\n\"What are you doing?\" Victoria's eyes widened in panic. She never expected William to tie her up.\nIgnoring her cries, William pressed her against the edge of the pool.\nHe kissed her collarbone, his hand moving to her long, slender legs, his fingers slipping under her skirt, teasing her through her lace panties.\nVictoria's body trembled uncontrollably, the water rippling around them.\nHer body heated up under William's skilled touch, her cheeks flushing, her eyes glazing over, a warm sensation spreading from between her legs.\nHer reaction excited William, who lowered his head to lightly suck on her red lips.\nHis fingers pressed and rubbed her sensitive spot.\nVictoria bit her lip in shame, her eyes misting over, her body shaking even more.\nHer legs involuntarily wrapped around William's narrow waist.\nNoticing her response, William felt a surge of pleasure. He looked into her eyes, his gaze wild and seductive. \"Enjoying it, aren't you?\"\n\"No, please, don't.\" Victoria's voice was broken with sobs.\n\"I won't stop.\" William said, lifting her hips to place her on his lap.\nVictoria could feel William's arousal pressing against her, ready to invade her most private place.",

Let me go! I hate you!\"\nHer sobs only seemed to fuel William's aggression.\nEach thrust brought tears to Victoria's eyes.\nAmidst the pain, a pleasant sensation began to creep in.\n\"William! Stop, it hurts! William, you maniac, help! Help!\"\nHer cries were silenced by his kiss.\nWilliam pushed deeper, feeling her body tense around him, his eyes darkening.\nOne of his large hands gripped her breast, while the other slid down to grip her hips.\nVictoria was on the verge of collapse, tears streaming down her face.\nHe forced her to arch her body to meet his movements.\nVictoria was on the brink of fainting, yet she couldn't control the waves of sensation overtaking her.\nHer body, sensitive to this unfamiliar yet familiar feeling, clung helplessly to William's shoulders, sobbing.\n\"Victoria, tell me, who's better, me or Samuel?\"\nHer body convulsed uncontrollably, but she bit her lip hard, shaking her head in despair, tears falling.\n\"I want you to admit you love me, Victoria. You love me.\" William's voice was hoarse, like a broken string.\nSweat covered his forehead, his handsome face flushed, his eyes clouded with madness.\nAt the same time, he thrust deeply into her.\nThe blend of extreme gentleness and brutality was seamless.\nVictoria screamed, her body jerking, her fluids gushing onto William's deeply embedded member.\nHer body went limp, her muscles tightening around him.\nHe sighed deeply, pulling back and thrusting again, the pleasure overwhelming Victoria to the point of dizziness.\nFluids splashed, passion soared, and in his fervor, William bit down on Victoria's collarbone, grinding with his molars, nearly drawing blood.\nWhen William finally finished, Victoria lay trembling by the edge of the tub, still dazed from the one-sided, frenzied encounter.\nShe felt utterly drained, her body floating, barely clinging to consciousness.\nWilliam finally released her, carrying her limp form out of the hot spring.\nHe laid her on the bed, whispering in her ear, \"You said I wasn't good enough. Tonight, I'll prove I'm a hundred times better than Samuel.\"\nVictoria's pupils contracted. She opened her mouth, but before she could speak, William's body covered hers again.\n\"Victoria, from now on, no one else can touch you. Got it? Or I'll kill you.\" With that, he entered her again without waiting for a response.\nThat night, Victoria was repeatedly brought to the brink of unconsciousness and back, caught in a cycle of intense pain and pleasure.\nThe next morning, sunlight streamed into the room. Victoria struggled to open her eyes, her body aching as if she'd been hit by a truck.\n\"Awake?\" William sat at the edge of the bed, his chiseled features shrouded in shadow.\nVictoria frowned, uneasily shifting her body.\n\"Hurts?\" William's tone was indifferent, almost emotionless.\n\"Get out!\" Victoria was furious, wishing she could stab him.\n\"I remember you crying quite passionately last night.\" His casual tone hit a nerve, making Victoria even more agitated.\nShe gritted her teeth in hatred. \"William! You're not even human!\"\nWilliam didn't mind her insults, chuckling softly. \"Of course I'm not. I'm a madman, a beast, a bastard.\"\nVictoria was stunned. Was he giving up on himself?\nWilliam patted her cheek, his voice cold. \"No matter what I am, you're mine unless I die.\"\nWith that, he got up and began dressing leisurely.\nHis body was impressive, muscular and toned, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist.\nEvery inch of his physique exuded a deadly allure.\nVictoria stared at him, unable to look away.\nFully dressed, William approached her, looking down. He reached to touch her face, but she instinctively recoiled.\nHis hand paused mid-air before he nonchalantly withdrew it. \"Stay in the room today. I'll find your father.\"\nVictoria's body retreated, avoiding his touch. William's hand fell back, and he inserted it into his pocket.\n\"Don't wander off. If you're hungry, call room service.\" He warned her before leaving the bedroom.\nAs soon as the door closed, Victoria collapsed on the bed, her eyes vacant, tears slipping down her cheeks.\nExhausted, she locked the safety chain and fell into a deep sleep.\nShe didn't know how long she slept, but a faint noise broke the silence.\nAt first, it was barely noticeable.\nThen, a sharp sound shattered the quiet-a key card unlocking the door.\nIn her sleep, Victoria vaguely heard the noise, thinking William had returned.\nShe forced herself awake, rubbing her eyes, ready to get up.\nBut as she was about to get out of bed, the door was violently slammed, shaking the frame as if someone outside was desperate to get in.",

If he were back, he'd know she locks the door when she sleeps and would call first.\nThe room fell into an eerie silence. The door that had been hit stood still, with no further noise.\nVictoria barely dared to breathe. She sat on the bed, staring at the door, her hands clutching the blanket so tightly her knuckles turned white.\nAfter what felt like an eternity, with no more sounds outside, Victoria cautiously moved her feet, silently approaching the door.\nShe reached out with a trembling hand, slowly bringing her eye close to the peephole to see what was happening.\nThe hallway outside was dimly lit and empty, eerily quiet.\nJust as she was about to breathe a sigh of relief, a bloodshot, menacing eye suddenly appeared on the other side of the peephole, as if it had been lurking in the darkness, waiting for her to look.\nVictoria screamed in terror, instinctively stumbling back several steps, nearly tripping in her panic.\nShe covered her mouth with her hand, trying to stifle any more sounds, but her heart pounded loudly in her chest, impossible to calm.\nCold sweat poured from her forehead and back, soaking her clothes, and her body trembled uncontrollably.\nA loud banging came from the door.\nVictoria pressed herself against the wall, trying to control her shaking and stay calm.\nSuddenly, she thought of calling the front desk. She fumbled for her phone on the nightstand, her fingers quickly dialing the number.\nWhen the call connected, she tried to keep her voice steady, stammering, \"Hello, this is Room 805. There's a man banging on my door. Please send someone to help me immediately.\"\nThe person outside must have heard her making the call, as the banging abruptly stopped, followed by a string of vile curses: \"You bitch, calling for help? Just wait, I'll deal with you later!\"\nHe kicked the door hard and then walked away.\nNot long after, there was another knock at the door.\nVictoria cautiously approached the peephole again and saw the little girl she had met yesterday, Giselle, along with two burly security guards.\nShe quickly opened the door. Giselle immediately noticed Victoria's fear and unease, stepping forward to hold her hand and softly reassure her, \"Victoria, don't be scared. It's okay now.\"\nGiselle's eyes were full of concern and sympathy, her small hand conveying a warm strength that helped calm Victoria's frantic heart.\nThen, Giselle looked at Victoria with some anxiety and said, \"Victoria, please don't call the police, okay? This resort belongs to my brother. We'll take full responsibility for what happened. We'll check the surveillance right away and make sure you get an explanation.\"\nHer eyes were sincere and urgent, clearly afraid that Victoria might impulsively involve the police, causing an international incident and damaging the resort's reputation.\nVictoria looked at the young but earnest Giselle in front of her, hesitated for a moment, and finally nodded.\nShe knew that in this unfamiliar place, having a friend was better than making an enemy, and Giselle seemed genuinely willing to help.\nSeeing Victoria agree, Giselle smiled with relief, quickly giving instructions to the security guards before they hurried to the surveillance room.\nBut when Giselle and the guards anxiously pulled up the surveillance footage, it made everyone frown.\nDuring the time the suspicious man appeared, the footage first shook violently.\nThen, a hand holding a baseball cap reached out, precisely covering the hallway camera, plunging the screen into darkness.\nGiselle's face turned pale, and Victoria immediately realized that such a skilled and targeted action was likely done by someone from the resort.\nHer mind flashed to the two men who had troubled her yesterday. They had bad intentions then, and now, with William away, they had come again. The suspicion was too strong.\n\"Victoria, I'm so sorry. This is our fault. Our security wasn't up to par.\"\nGiselle's eyes reddened with tears, her voice trembling, \"I'll find out what happened as soon as possible and give you an explanation! Please don't call the police. If this turns into an international incident, our resort's business will be ruined. Victoria, how about this: no matter how long you stay here, I'll waive your room fee as an apology.\"\nVictoria weighed her options. She understood that in a foreign country, the fewer complications, the better, and Giselle seemed genuinely kind.\nAfter a moment of thought, she nodded slightly.\nVictoria slowly climbed the stairs, heading back to her room.\nAs she reached the corner, she saw Jett and Hayden from yesterday.\nHer alarm bells went off, and she instinctively slowed her pace, watching them warily, pressing herself against the side of the stairs to stay as far from them as possible.\nJett, with a cigarette dangling from his mouth, swaggered along. Seeing Victoria, he smirked maliciously.\nHe deliberately swung his shoulder, bumping into her, muttering, \"What a coincidence. Sorry, didn't see you, slipped.\"\nVictoria couldn't dodge in time, stumbling and hitting the wall hard.\nA local wooden carving hung on the wall, its sharp edges scratching her arm. The pain was sharp, but the cut wasn't deep, and there was no blood.\n\"Such delicate skin, looks so fragile,\" Jett's eyes roamed over Victoria like a predator, his gaze making her feel like he wanted to devour her.\nVictoria looked into his eyes, a chill running from her feet to her head, her mind flashing back to the bloodshot, menacing eye at the peephole.\n\"Hurry up!\" Hayden, ahead, turned back impatiently, glaring at Jett before forcing a fake smile at Victoria, \"Miss, don't be scared. With your boyfriend so fierce, we wouldn't dare bother you now.\"\nAfter they swaggered down the stairs, Giselle appeared out of nowhere, angrily blocking Jett, demanding, \"Jett, was that your doing just now?\"",

        "content": "Victoria returned to her room, nervously locking the door and adding an extra bolt for good measure.\nShe kept glancing at the time on her phone. William had been gone for most of the day with no word.\nDespite her intense dislike for him now, she still didn't want anything bad to happen to him.\nThe thought made her even more anxious.\nClutching her phone tightly, she bit her lip and hesitated for a long time before finally dialing William's number.\nBut the phone rang for a long time without anyone answering.\nVictoria's heart leapt into her throat, and a wave of worry and fear washed over her. She couldn't help but dial William's number again, but once more, there was no answer.\nIn that moment, Victoria's mind buzzed with panic.\nWilliam, please don't let anything have happened to you.\nPanic quickly spread through her body. Her fingers fumbled over the phone screen as she sent William a message: [Are you okay?]\nAfter she sent the message, her eyes stayed glued to the screen, afraid to miss his reply.\nAnd then began the long wait.\nVictoria paced back and forth in the room, anxiety gnawing at her.\nOutside, the sun blazed brightly, casting a vibrant glow over the tropical greenery of the resort, full of life and energy.\nBut inside, she felt like she was in an icebox, the cold seeping into her bones.\nHow could she just sit here and wait?\nWhat if something really had happened to William? What would she do then?\nVictoria bit her lip hard, made up her mind, and quickly changed into some comfortable clothes, putting on a baseball cap. She was determined to go out and look for him.\nJust as her hand grasped the doorknob, the door suddenly swung open from the outside.\nVictoria's eyes widened in shock. Standing at the door was William, supporting someone.\n\"Ms. Scott?\" Victoria was both surprised and relieved. She hurried forward to help William bring Daisy into the room, then anxiously looked outside. \"Where's my dad? Is he behind you?\"\nDaisy looked exhausted and worn out, glancing up at Victoria.\nJust as she was about to speak, William cut in quietly, \"Close the door first. We'll talk inside.\"\nA wave of unease washed over Victoria, a sense of foreboding settling in her heart.\nShe forced herself to stay calm and nodded.\nOnce inside, Victoria didn't waste any time. Seeing Daisy's clothes covered in dirt and grime, she quickly found some clean clothes for her to change into.\nDaisy's emotions were relatively stable, but her attempt to appear calm was too obvious. Anyone paying attention could see the fear in her eyes.\nShe looked at Victoria, her lips trembling, and managed to say, \"Victoria, I'm sorry.\"\nVictoria was pouring water into a cup when she heard this. Her hand shook, spilling hot water and burning her hand. She let out a small cry and quickly put the cup down.\nWilliam reacted instantly, grabbing her hand and carefully checking it. \"Did you burn yourself? Is it bad?\"\n\"I'm fine.\" Victoria pulled her hand back forcefully, not even looking at him.\nShe turned to Daisy, trying to appear calm, but her eyes betrayed her worry and fear. \"Ms. Scott, can you tell me where my dad is now?\"\nDaisy opened her mouth, but before she could speak, she started coughing violently.\nShe coughed several times, her whole body hunching over.\nFrom Daisy's halting, tearful account, Victoria finally learned what had happened after they were captured.\nThat day, Alvin had fought off several gang members to protect Daisy during a gang fight.\nOne of them was the top enforcer for the local gang, The Raven Syndicate.\nAfter they were captured, the gang wanted to kill them.\nIt was only because Daisy revealed her identity as a member of the Scott family from Crystalia and offered to pay for their lives that they were temporarily spared.\nWhen William brought the $50 million ransom, the gang demanded three times that amount.\nWilliam had no choice but to pay an additional $100 million.\nBut seeing how generous he was, the gang went back on their word, agreeing to release only one person and demanding $1 billion to release the other.\nWilliam had no choice but to get Daisy out first.\nDaisy lit a cigarette, her hands shaking. She looked up at Victoria, her voice trembling. \"I'm sorry, Victoria. Your dad could have escaped on his own. He stayed because of me. I wanted him to go with William, but he refused.\"\nHearing this, Victoria's hands clenched tightly at her sides, her face turning pale. \"I'm calling the police.\"\nWilliam scoffed. \"Call the police? Do you know where we are? This is Xandria! The police and the gangs are in cahoots. Do you think the police will risk crossing The Raven Syndicate for you and your dad? Wake up.\"\nHis tone was cold and harsh.\nHis words felt like a knife to Victoria's chest, making it hard for her to breathe.\nVictoria closed her eyes in pain, tears streaming down her face uncontrollably.\nSuddenly, she grabbed William tightly, her voice breaking with desperation. \"William, please, give me the $1 billion to save my father. I'll do anything for you, work for you for the rest of my life, no complaints. Please.\"\nHer voice was hoarse with despair, her eyes full of pleading.\nWilliam looked at Victoria, both angry and anxious.\nHe bent down, trying to lift her up, but she stubbornly pushed him away.\nHe sighed, his voice tinged with exhaustion and urgency. \"Victoria, get up. Calm down! Even if we could gather $1 billion in cash quickly, do you know what that would mean? Such a large amount could cause international issues. And you saw what The Raven Syndicate is like. They'd take the money and kill us all. We wouldn't save your father, and we might all end up dead.\"\n\"I don't believe it! I don't believe they would be so brazen!\" Victoria shouted, her voice filled with sorrow and anger. \"You just don't want to save my dad! He killed your parents, and you want him dead. I was foolish to trust you. How ridiculous of me!\"\nWilliam's brow furrowed deeper, his face darkening.\nHe stared at Victoria, his lips trembling, struggling to speak. \"Is that what you think of me?\"\n\"Yes!\" Victoria answered without hesitation, her eyes red and swollen, shouting at William with gritted teeth. \"In my eyes, you're a despicable, treacherous, heartless bastard! If you won't save him, I will!\"",

        "content": "Victoria yanked the door open, ready to storm out.\nWilliam grabbed her arm, his chest heaving with anger, fists clenched tight.\n\"Victoria!\" he yelled, his voice full of fury.\nVictoria didn't flinch. She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze with defiance.\nThe tension was thick enough to cut with a knife.\nDaisy, sensing the escalating situation, quickly stepped in, grabbing William's arm. \"William, don't fight with Victoria. She's just upset.\"\nThen Daisy turned to Victoria, her voice soothing. \"Victoria, don't get William wrong. He's already got Harry working on getting the money back home, but we need a backup plan, right? What if they take the money and still don't let your dad go? We have to be ready.\"\n\"Victoria, can you be reasonable?\" William's forehead veins bulged, his anger barely contained. \"What are you planning to do? Get yourself killed?\"\nHe turned sharply to Daisy. \"Keep an eye on her.\"\n\"Okay,\" Daisy replied softly, stepping forward to hold Victoria's hand. \"Listen, Victoria, now's not the time to fight with William. For my sake, he'll do everything he can to save your father.\"\nWilliam paused at the door, giving Victoria a long, intense look before rushing out.\nDaisy led Victoria to the couch, sighing as she lit a cigarette and took a deep drag.\n\"If it weren't for saving me, he wouldn't have been captured.\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together, her eyes shimmering with suppressed emotion.\nShe wanted to tell Daisy it wasn't her fault, but the words wouldn't come out.\nAlvin was captured because of Daisy. As his daughter, how could she not feel any resentment?\nBut it was Alvin's choice, and she couldn't take her anger out on Daisy.\nShe lowered her head, staying silent.\nDaisy gently ruffled her hair, sighing. \"I know you hate William, but I don't want you to make a mistake. This time, stay here and wait for his news. He promised to save your dad, and he won't go back on his word.\"\nVictoria was silent for a long time before she finally responded with a low \"okay.\"\nShe looked down, pausing for a moment before speaking softly. \"I know he's not that kind of person, but I...\"\n\"You're just too worried,\" Daisy said, patting Victoria's hand gently. \"Victoria, listen to me. Only William can help you save your father now.\"\nVictoria fell silent again, nodding after a long pause.\nIn the afternoon, Victoria decided to head to the resort entrance to buy some essentials. Giselle happened to pass by and called out to her.\n\"Victoria, I told my brother about what happened yesterday. He said he'll handle it, so don't worry.\"\n\"I'm not planning to pursue it. I just hope things can be peaceful here at the resort,\" Victoria said with a faint smile.\n\"Absolutely, I promise there won't be any more trouble!\" Giselle assured her, patting her chest.\nVictoria nodded slightly and turned to leave.\nWhen she returned to the resort with her bags, a scream suddenly came from the storage room in the corner.\nHer heart tightened, and she quickly looked in the direction of the sound.\nThrough the crack in the door, she saw Jett and Hayden lying on the ground, covered in blood and groaning in pain.\nA burly man stood with his back to her, holding a baseball bat, teaching the two a lesson.\nThe man crouched down, grabbing Jett by the collar, his voice cold as ice. \"Didn't I tell you not to mess with any guests at this resort?\"\nJett trembled, his voice shaking as he tried to explain. \"Mr. Hopper, I didn't do anything to her, just scared her a bit.\"\nThe man yanked him closer, his eyes filled with murderous intent. \"You've got some nerve.\"\nJett shivered even more, quickly pleading. \"Mr. Hopper, please spare me. I was wrong. I won't do it again.\"\n\"Next time, I'll cripple you,\" the man said, letting go. Jett collapsed to the ground like a pile of mush.\nVictoria clutched her bags tightly, her palms sweaty, staring at the man. She thought, 'Is he Giselle's brother? The owner of this resort? Why does his voice sound so familiar?'\nAs the man stood up, she instinctively shrank back, trying to hide.\nShe thought she was well-hidden, but the man seemed to sense something. He turned slowly and walked straight toward her.\nVictoria was about to run, but when she saw the scar on his brow and the earring in his left ear, she was stunned.\nIt was Louie, the man who had chatted with her on the plane!\nToday, he wore a simple outfit typical of Xandria's casual style.\nA crisp white cotton T-shirt with sparse gold embroidery at the collar, loose shorts at the waist, and flip-flops on his feet.\nHe looked more relaxed and carefree.\nBut the sharp aura around him hadn't diminished at all.\nLouie approached with steady steps, looking down at Victoria, a hint of surprise in his eyes, followed by a meaningful smile. \"Well, well, it's you. We must be destined to meet.\"\nHis voice was low and raspy, with a touch of mockery.\nVictoria swallowed, trying to stay calm.\nShe looked up, forcing a stiff smile. \"Mr. Hopper, what a coincidence.\"\nLouie narrowed his eyes, suddenly leaning down to meet her gaze. \"I remember your name is Victoria, right?\"\n\"Yes, Victoria Carter.\" Victoria replied, her smile strained.\nOne of Louie's men leaned in, whispering in his ear. \"Jett and Hayden were harassing her.\"\nLouie raised an eyebrow, his gaze turning playful as he looked at Victoria.\nShe was indeed beautiful, no wonder Jett and Hayden dared to break his rules to harass her.\nEven he had tried to chat her up on the plane.\nVictoria felt a chill down her spine, instinctively stepping back.\nLouie chuckled softly, asking, \"Ms. Carter, you were frightened at my resort. As the owner, I owe you an explanation, so...\"\nHe paused deliberately before continuing. \"How would you like to settle this? A broken hand? A broken leg? Or something more severe? I can make it happen.\"\nHearing this, Jett and Hayden turned pale.\nThey hadn't expected that the woman they harassed was someone Louie was interested in.\nThey struggled to get up, kneeling at Louie's feet, begging for mercy.\n\"Mr. Hopper, please spare us. We were wrong. We won't do it again.\"\n\"I was wrong. Please let me go.\"\n\"Get lost!\" Louie kicked them away in disgust.\nHe looked at Victoria, smiling. \"Ms. Carter, how would you like to punish them? Just say the word.\"\nVictoria was stunned for a moment, then quickly shook her head. \"No need.\"\n\"Really? Ms. Carter, you are kind,\" Louie said slowly. \"In that case, I'll have to handle it differently.\"\nHe signaled to his subordinate, Paxton, who understood immediately. Paxton walked over and swung the baseball bat hard at the two men's groins.",

        "content": "A piercing scream echoed through the entire vacation house.\nJett clutched his groin, sweat pouring down his forehead.\nHayden had already passed out from the pain, his face twisted in agony.\nVictoria was stunned by what she had just witnessed, unable to speak for a moment.\nLouie seemed to relish her terrified expression, his smile both sinister and alluring. \"Ms. Carter, are you satisfied now?\"\nVictoria's teeth chattered uncontrollably as she nodded shakily. \"Yes.\"\nShe had never encountered such a ruthless man before.\nLouie was terrifying.\nSeeing her still in shock, Louie's interest only grew. He grabbed Victoria's right hand, bringing it to his lips for a kiss, and said softly, \"Don't be afraid. As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you.\"\nHe then ordered his men to drag Jett and Hayden away.\nLouie's men knew what this meant. Despite his reputation for being cold and indifferent to women, it didn't mean he was completely immune to their charms.\nDuring particularly lonely times, he would occasionally seek out female company.\nHe had never married and had no steady partner. The only woman who was involved with him was Matilda, the sister of his right-hand man, Alfonso.\nHowever, Matilda had been hospitalized with a serious illness for some time, leaving Louie to suppress his desires.\nNow, his intentions towards Victoria were unmistakably clear.\nLouie's men, seasoned in the underworld, could read his signals perfectly. They exchanged glances, understanding that Louie had taken an interest in Victoria.\nVictoria's hand was still in Louie's grip.\nShe bit her lip, using all her strength to pull her hand away.\nLouie held her smooth, delicate fingers, his thumb caressing her soft skin. He chuckled softly, \"Ms. Carter, how about you join me for dinner as an apology?\"\nHis tone sent chills down Victoria's spine.\n\"Sorry, I have other plans.\"\nLouie didn't let go, his grip firm on her slender wrist. \"What, you don't want to?\"\nHis gaze was so intense that Victoria felt suffocated, cold sweat forming on her forehead.\nJust then, a cold voice interrupted, \"Let her go.\"\nVictoria turned to see William standing a short distance away, his expression dark.\nLouie looked surprised for a moment, then smirked. \"So, it's Ms. Carter's boyfriend. My men were out of line, and I was just inviting her to dinner to apologize. Why so angry?\"\nDespite his casual words, the challenge in his eyes was clear.\nWilliam quickly stepped forward, pulling Victoria into his arms.\n\"No need. I'll thank Mr. Hopper on her behalf.\" With that, William took Victoria's hand and started to leave.\nPaxton and the others moved to block them, but Louie stopped them.\nLouie watched William's retreating figure, a faint smile playing on his lips. \"We'll meet again.\"\nWilliam's face was stormy as he dragged Victoria back to their room.\nOnce inside the elevator, he turned abruptly, glaring at her.\n\"You don't trust me enough? You had to go find The Raven Syndicate's leader yourself to save your father?\"\nVictoria was baffled by his words. \"What are you talking about? I don't know anything about The Raven Syndicate's leader!\"\nWilliam scoffed. \"Don't know him? The man who wouldn't let go of your hand just now is Louie, the leader of The Raven Syndicate.\"\nHe turned to leave.\nVictoria bit her lip and hurried after him.\n\"William!\" she called, catching up. \"I was just out buying some essentials. I happened to see him punishing the two men who harassed me yesterday. They tried to break into my room again today.\"\nWilliam stopped in his tracks, turning to her with a frown. \"When did that happen?\"\nVictoria nodded quickly. \"This morning, after you left.\"\nWilliam's eyes narrowed slightly. \"I see.\"\nHis expression softened a bit as he looked at her. \"When I'm not around, stay in the room. It's too dangerous outside.\"\nSeeing his anger subside, Victoria cautiously approached. \"Is that man really the leader of The Raven Syndicate? The one who took my father?\"\n\"Yes.\" William glanced at her. \"So when I saw you there, I was furious and worried. I just wanted to get you back and teach you a lesson.\"\nVictoria could guess what kind of \"lesson\" he meant.\nShe bit her lip, then looked up at him. \"Since he's the one responsible, can we...\"\nWilliam quickly covered her mouth. \"Shut up! This is his territory. Do you want to get yourself killed?\"\nRealizing how reckless her idea was, Victoria fell silent.\nWilliam, seeing her finally calm down, relaxed a bit and led her back to their room.\nAfter a moment of silence, Victoria couldn't help but ask, \"My father...\"\nWilliam gently pulled her closer. \"We'll talk in the room.\"\n\"I understand, but you don't have to hold me like this.\" Victoria tried to pull away, but William held her tighter, whispering in her ear, \"Someone might be watching.\"\nVictoria froze, not daring to move.\nWilliam's lips curled into a barely noticeable smile as he led her to their room.\nOnce inside, he still didn't let go until Victoria pushed his hand away.\nThe room was filled with the smell of smoke.\nDaisy stood by the window, a cigarette between her fingers, the ashtray overflowing with butts.\n\"Why so many?\" William frowned, opening the window to air out the room.\nDaisy quickly asked, \"How did it go?\"\nVictoria also looked at William anxiously.\n\"I found where they're holding him,\" William replied. \"Tonight, I'll take some men and sneak in.\"\nHe paused before adding, \"If all goes well, I'll have him out by tomorrow.\"",

        "content": "\"That's good, that's good,\" Daisy sighed in relief, her whole body seeming to deflate as she collapsed onto the couch and fell into a deep sleep.\nShe hadn't had a good night's sleep in ages.\nVictoria grabbed a blanket and gently covered her.\nThen she gave William a look, signaling him to follow her into another room of the suite.\nWilliam could tell she had something to say, so he followed her without a word.\nOnce inside, Victoria stared at him intently, trying to read his expression.\nShe couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.\nBut she couldn't pinpoint what it was, or maybe she was just too scared, causing her to imagine things.\nWilliam quickly noticed Victoria's gaze on him. His eyes fell on her pale face, and he frowned slightly.\n\"What are you looking at?\" he asked calmly.\n\"Do you think you can do it?\"\nHearing the worry in her voice, William felt a surprising warmth in his heart. He looked at her with a faint smile. \"Are you worried about me, or worried that I won't be able to save your dad?\"\nVictoria bit her lip and said nothing.\n\"If something happens to me, wouldn't you be free? You wouldn't have to deal with me anymore, or be tangled up in all this mess. You could completely move on, live the life you want, marry Samuel, have kids, and...\"\n\"Stop it!\" Victoria suddenly looked up, her eyes red as she interrupted him. \"Do you think saying this is funny? Does it make you feel accomplished? Do you think saying this will make me feel guilty, make me reluctant to let you go? Well, it won't! I'll just feel relieved, finally free from you! I'll be happy every day, and I'll forget all about you!\"\nHer eyes were red, tears clinging to her lashes, making her look especially pitiful.\nWilliam was stunned, staring at her in a daze, unable to react.\nHe suddenly remembered the first time he met her, how she looked when she cried. Back then, she was like a wounded kitten, fragile and helpless.\nAt that time, Alvin was already in prison, and he hadn't planned on seeking further revenge.\nBut seeing Victoria's pitiful appearance, he impulsively suggested becoming her sugar daddy.\nHe told himself it was just to get back at Alvin, not because he had any feelings for Victoria.\nMaybe he had been wrong from the start.\nIf he could do it over, he would protect her, not let anyone hurt her, including himself.\nWilliam looked at her deeply, feeling a soft spot in his heart being gently touched.\nSuddenly, he pulled Victoria into his arms.\n\"Let go of me! You jerk! I have a boyfriend, you have no right to hold me like this! William! I'm warning you! Don't touch me! You bastard, you scoundrel!\"\nHer struggle was pointless, and all she could do was shouting: \"Get off me! Let go! I hate you! I never want to see you again! You piece of trash!\"\n\"If you keep cursing, I might not be able to resist making love to you,\" he whispered in her ear, his tone calm.\nVictoria froze, staring at him in disbelief. \"You're crazy!\"\n\"Stop it,\" William scolded softly in her ear.\nVictoria was stunned, her body ceasing to struggle.\nAfter a moment, she seemed to come to her senses and punched William hard in the chest.\nBut William didn't let go, instead holding her even tighter.\n\"Victoria, I'm really sorry,\" he said, his voice low and hoarse, filled with helplessness and fatigue. \"What happened back then was my fault. You can blame me. But Victoria, I really love you. Whether you believe it or not, if I save your father, can you forgive me?\"\nHe didn't say anything more, just rested his chin on Victoria's shoulder, holding her as if he wanted to merge her into his body.\nAt that moment, Victoria found herself speechless, overwhelmed with emotion.\nShe had always thought William would never bow to her, that he would always be proud and strong. But she never expected him to have such a moment of helplessness and humility.\nWilliam, who had always been so high and mighty, was now holding her tightly, apologizing in a low voice.\nBut the obstacles between them were no longer just about Alice.\nAs long as the truth about his parents' death remained unknown, Alvin would be responsible in William's eyes.\nAnd Alvin's imprisonment was partly William's doing.\nNot to mention the past two years of humiliation and torment she had endured from him, all in the name of revenge against Alvin.\nForgive him?\nHow could she?\nVictoria closed her eyes, hiding the tumultuous emotions within.\nAfter a long while, she slowly spoke, her voice choked and hoarse. \"William, it's impossible for us.\"\nWilliam's body shook violently, then he released Victoria.\nSeeing his desolate expression, Victoria bit her lip and looked away.\nWilliam was silent for a moment before he slowly said, \"No matter what, I'll save your dad. Don't worry.\"\nHearing this, Victoria looked up at him. After a moment, she slowly said, \"William, if-I'm saying if-something goes wrong, I want you to protect yourself first. You have no obligation to risk your life for my dad. It's not worth it for anyone.\"\nWilliam looked deeply at Victoria. After a long pause, he slowly replied, \"I understand. You stay here and wait for news. I'll go prepare.\"\nWith that, he turned and left, his figure appearing lonely and desolate.\nVictoria watched his tall, rigid back, her eyes gradually filling with tears.\nAfter William left, Daisy came in.\nIt turned out she hadn't been asleep earlier; she just wanted to give them space to talk.\nBut the outcome might not have been what she had hoped for.\nDaisy hadn't slept in two or three days, dark circles under her eyes making her look even more haggard.\nSeeing her worn-out appearance, Victoria couldn't help but urge, \"Ms. Scott, why don't you get some sleep? I'll wake you if there's any news.\"\nDaisy waved her off, pulling out a cigarette and lighting it. She took a deep drag and exhaled a long stream of smoke.\nThen she mechanically took out another cigarette and offered it to Victoria.\nThis time, Victoria didn't refuse. She took the cigarette, lit it, and sat on the couch with Daisy.\nOutside, the night grew darker.\nDaisy became increasingly restless, her fingers tapping incessantly on her knees.\nHowever, in front of Victoria, she tried to maintain her composure, though her hand trembled uncontrollably as she tried to light the cigarette. After several failed attempts, she threw the lighter and unlit cigarette onto the table in frustration.\nSeeing this, Victoria silently got up and poured a glass of water, placing it gently in front of Daisy.\nAfter a moment's hesitation, she softly asked, \"Ms. Scott, can I ask why you followed my dad to Xandria?\"\nHearing this, Daisy gave a bitter smile and looked up at Victoria. \"Because I love your dad. I've loved him for over ten years.\"",

What does he think?\"\nDaisy's eyes clouded over, her face full of sorrow. \"Your dad was actually my first love. Back then, I used to go with my brother and sister-in-law, William's parents, to check on the bridge construction. Your dad was a brilliant designer, always so knowledgeable, gentle, and polite to everyone. He was super dedicated, often working late into the night.\"\nAs Daisy reminisced, a small smile crept onto her lips.\n\"The more time I spent with him, the more I liked him. But I knew he was married, so I never dared to show my feelings. Later, I accidentally found out he was going through a divorce with your mom. I admit I was a bit happy then. But when I learned they didn't go through with it, I gave up. After that, the bridge collapsed, and my brother and sister-in-law died in the accident. I had to help manage the company and take care of William, so I gradually drifted apart from your dad.\"\nDaisy paused, seemingly lost in the past.\n\"Two years ago, I heard your dad was being blamed for the bridge collapse. I rushed to the detention center to see him. I never believed it was his fault, but for some reason, he admitted it was. Recently, when I told him you were going to donate a kidney to your mom, he got anxious. With William's and my help, we managed to get him out on parole.\"\nVictoria felt a whirlwind of emotions after hearing Daisy's explanation.\nSo, Alvin and the Scott family had such a deep connection.\n\"I came to Xandria with your dad to help him secure the old town renovation project. I never expected things to turn out like this. It's all my fault.\" Daisy looked at Victoria with guilt, gently stroking her hair. \"Victoria, I'm sorry.\"\nVictoria shook her head and sighed softly. \"This isn't your fault. It's my dad's choice.\"\nDaisy's hand slowly dropped, her gaze shifting to the window. \"You know, Victoria, when your parents were going through their divorce, I proposed to your dad, but he turned me down.\"\nVictoria was taken aback, looking at Daisy in surprise.\nDaisy gave a bitter smile and continued, \"I was young and impulsive then, completely in love with him. I thought as long as two people loved each other, nothing could stand in their way. I didn't care about the difference in our family status or societal views. I even planned to run away with him and live a life just for us.\"\nHer eyes softened, as if she was seeing her brave, younger self again.\n\"But he refused me outright. He said he had responsibilities and a family to take care of. He couldn't be so reckless.\"\nDaisy's voice grew quieter, tinged with sadness. \"I was so angry and hurt then, thinking he didn't understand my feelings. I wanted to forget him completely, but it wasn't that easy.\"\nVictoria listened quietly, feeling a pang of sorrow in her heart.\nShe had never imagined that Alvin and Daisy had such a deep and complicated relationship.\nDaisy sighed softly and turned to Victoria. \"Victoria, I know it might be a weird time to say this, but I want you to know that my feelings for your dad have never changed. If he comes back safely this time, I'll do whatever it takes to be with him.\"\nVictoria couldn't help but laugh, looking at Daisy with a smile. \"Alright, I'll be on your side then.\"\nDaisy playfully tapped her on the head. \"You little rascal!\"\nVictoria chuckled and suddenly said, \"Ms. Scott, you must be hungry. We don't know how long we'll have to wait tonight. I'll go to the resort's restaurant and get us something to eat.\"\nDaisy thought for a moment and agreed. They needed their strength for what lay ahead.\nShe nodded. \"Alright, I'll go with you.\"\n\"No need. You stay here and rest. The resort has security patrolling everywhere. It's safe. You haven't slept for a day and a night. You need to rest.\"\nDaisy hesitated but eventually nodded, reminding her, \"Be careful and come back soon.\"\nVictoria left the room and headed to the restaurant.\nAs she reached a corner, she was about to step forward when she noticed a woman approaching.\nThe woman wore a brightly colored dress adorned with intricate golden patterns. A belt studded with colorful gems accentuated her graceful figure.\nHer long, shiny hair was loosely tied up, with a few strands falling around her slender neck.\nShe wore large silver earrings that swayed with her movements, making a crisp sound.\nShe was strikingly beautiful.\nThe woman stopped about two feet from Victoria, scrutinizing her.\nVictoria frowned and took a cautious step back, trying to avoid her.\nBut the woman seemed to anticipate her move, quickly stepping to block her path, staring intently at her. \"So pretty, no wonder men like you.\"\nVictoria shivered, finding the woman's behavior extremely odd. Alarm bells rang in her mind, and she wanted to return to the room.\n\"Move, I need to go back.\"\nThe woman didn't budge, a strange smile on her lips. \"Don't blame me, blame Louie for liking you.\"\nVictoria's heart tightened. Before she could react, a hand covered her mouth and nose from behind.\nA pungent smell hit her.\nEther!\nVictoria struggled desperately, trying to pry the hand away and kicking wildly.\nBut gradually, her strength waned, and her vision blurred. Finally, she went limp and passed out.\nWhen she came to, her head was throbbing painfully.\nShe opened her eyes with difficulty and found herself in a dim room, the air damp and musty.\nMoss covered the walls, and old, broken items were scattered in the corners. The only window was boarded up, letting in no light.\nTerrified, Victoria tried to get up, only to realize her hands and feet were tightly bound.\n\"Help!\" she tried to shout, but her throat felt like it was on fire, her voice hoarse and weak.",

        "content": "Not long after, the door to the room swung open, and the woman from earlier sauntered in, swaying her hips.\nShe looked at the terrified Victoria, a smug, cold smile curling her lips. \"Well, look who's awake.\"\nShe took a few steps forward, crouched down in front of Victoria, and grabbed her chin, forcing her to look up. \"Don't blame me for being ruthless. Blame that pretty face of yours for making Louie lose his mind over you. I worked hard to get into Louie's bed. There's no way I'm letting you ruin it.\"\nThe malice in the woman's eyes made Victoria shudder. She gritted her teeth and snapped, \"You're nuts! I don't even like Louie.\"\nBefore she could finish, the woman, Matilda, slapped her hard across the face, cursing, \"Cut the crap! I've been with Louie for three years. Plenty of women have tried to seduce him, but I've never seen him so obsessed with anyone before. You bitch!\"\nWith that, she raised her hand and slapped Victoria again.\nThe stinging pain brought Victoria back to her senses. She glared at the woman, her voice trembling with anger. \"Didn't you say Louie cares about me? Aren't you afraid he'll come after you for this?\"\nThe woman laughed mockingly, looking at Victoria with disdain. \"Louie hates dirty people. If I have you raped first, the most he'll do is scold me. He won't do anything more.\"\nShe then opened the door and called in a few burly, rough-looking men, who were grinning wickedly. \"Here's a treat for you guys. This one's a rare beauty.\"\nThe men rubbed their hands together, their lecherous eyes roaming over Victoria.\nVictoria felt a chill run down her spine. She struggled with all her might, screaming, \"Get away from me! You bastards! Don't touch me!\"\n\"Really?\" One of the men rubbed his hands together, eager to start.\nMatilda giggled. \"Go ahead and have fun. I'll handle Louie.\"\nShe tossed a phone to one of the men and instructed, \"Turn on the camera and record everything.\"\nThe man eagerly took the phone and did as she said.\nVictoria's pupils contracted in fear as the men closed in on her. Her heart felt like it was sinking into an icy abyss, and she could barely breathe.\nJust when she thought all hope was lost, there was a sudden commotion outside. The door was kicked open, and Louie stormed in with his men. Without a word, he grabbed one of the men by the collar and punched him square in the face.\nThe man screamed and was sent flying.\nLouie glared at him, then picked up a brick from the floor and smashed it against another man's head.\nThe man's forehead split open, blood gushing out.\nMatilda was so terrified she couldn't move, collapsing to the floor. \"Louie...\"\nPaxton brought over a chair, and Louie sat down, crossing his legs casually. He looked at her with eyes as cold as ice. \"Who gave you the guts?\"\n\"Louie, I'm sorry! I was wrong!\" Matilda hadn't expected Louie to arrive so quickly.\nKnowing his temper, she crawled over, resting her head on his leg and pleading, \"Louie, I was wrong. I was out of my mind. Please don't be mad. Let me make it up to you.\"\nShe didn't care that others were in the room. Her hand trembled as she reached up his leg.\nHer wrist was caught.\nShe looked up, staring at Louie, tears streaming down her face.\nHis handsome face showed no emotion. He calmly lit a cigarette and brushed off his clothes. \"Paxton, lock her up with those men.\"\nMatilda's face turned as white as a sheet. She desperately tried to back away. \"No! Louie, please! No!\"\nLouie didn't spare her another glance.\nHayden stepped forward, grabbing her like a ragdoll and dragging her away without mercy.\nVictoria struggled to sit up, looking at Louie. He was watching her with a meaningful smile.\nThinking of Alvin still in his hands, Victoria forced down her fear and anger, trying to keep her voice steady. \"Thanks for earlier.\"\nLouie smirked. \"Where's your boyfriend? Why isn't he with you?\"\nVictoria's heart tightened, instantly on alert.\nWhat did he mean by that? Had he figured out William's plan?\nShe chose her words carefully. \"I just went downstairs to get some food. He can't follow me everywhere.\"\nLouie chuckled, his eyes unreadable, his tone teasing. \"Because of you, I had to get rid of my only woman. What do you think I should do with you?\"\nVictoria's eyes widened. She wanted to argue but was wary of his power. She cautiously explained, \"I don't even know who she is or what your relationship is. Isn't it a bit unfair to blame me?\"\n\"Unfair?\" He laughed. \"There's no such thing as fairness in this world.\"\nHe leaned closer, staring at her with undisguised desire, his hand slowly caressing her cheek.\nVictoria knew resisting was futile and provoking him would be suicidal.\nShe sat there stiffly, letting his hand slide from her cheek to her neck.\nLouie was surprised by how soft and smooth her skin was, his desire to possess her growing stronger.\nHe leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. \"You smell good.\"\nHis voice was thick with lust, making Victoria shiver.\nLouie suddenly scooped her up, startling her into grabbing his shirt. \"Let's play a game. I'll give your boyfriend an hour. If he can show up and take you away, I'll pretend this never happened.\"\n\"He's not my boyfriend, just...\" Victoria stammered, unable to explain that William was her ex-sugar daddy.\n\"Just what?\" Louie chuckled, a glint in his eye. \"A lover?\"\nVictoria didn't know how to respond, so she stayed silent. She bit her lip and said, \"It doesn't matter what he is. He doesn't know I'm in trouble or where I am. How could he get here in an hour?\"\nLouie smiled wickedly. \"The clock starts now.\"\nVictoria's eyes filled with desperation. \"You can't do this.\"\nLouie placed her in his black Rolls-Royce, casually reminding her, \"Fifty-nine minutes left.\"\nWith that, he walked around the car, got into the driver's seat, and drove off.\nA few minutes later, the car stopped in front of a luxurious restaurant.\nAs soon as Louie got out, the restaurant manager hurried over, bowing and scraping, and quickly ordered the staff to clear the place.",

        "content": "The manager stole a glance and noticed Victoria standing behind Louie, looking a bit surprised.\nLouie rarely brought women to these kinds of places. Even when he did, it was usually for business, never with this kind of special treatment.\nThough he was a mob boss, and \"devoted\" wasn't a word typically associated with him, for someone of his status, he was considered quite restrained.\nThe crystal chandelier cast a diamond-like light on Louie's shoulder. He turned slightly and gestured for the manager to hand the menu to Victoria. \"What do you wanna eat?\"\nVictoria hesitated for just a moment before taking the menu. Since she was already here, she decided to face it calmly.\nBesides, she couldn't afford to make any mistakes now, so she unceremoniously ordered a few signature dishes.\nLouie lit a cigarette, squinting at her with a slight smile on his lips.\nHe always disliked pretentious women, and Victoria's straightforwardness made him appreciate her a bit more.\nVictoria was also quite surprised. She thought she would be too nervous to enjoy the food.\nBut looking at the table full of delicious dishes, her appetite opened up, and she began to eat heartily.\nWhen she was full, she couldn't help but burp, feeling a bit embarrassed as she put down her utensils.\nLouie, who was leisurely savoring his food across from her, chuckled at her puffed cheeks and teased, \"Did you not eat for a week?\"\nDespite his words, he raised his hand to call the manager and softly said, \"Dessert.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\" The manager responded quickly, ordering the staff to clear the plates and bring out an array of exquisite desserts.\nVictoria glanced at them and, without further ado, picked her favorites and started eating.\nLouie's smile grew wider, and his gaze at Victoria became more curious. \"So, what do you do?\"\n\"I'm just a small-time artist,\" Victoria replied casually, trying to reveal as little as possible without lying.\nLouie's eyes lit up with interest, and he raised an eyebrow. \"Really? Interesting. Could you draw a portrait of me?\"\nVictoria instinctively tried to decline. \"I didn't bring my art supplies, so I can't.\"\nLouie chuckled softly and called the manager over, whispering a few instructions.\nSoon, the manager returned with several waiters, who quickly set up a complete set of brand-new art supplies on the table, from various brushes to paper and easels.\nSeeing this, Victoria knew she couldn't refuse any longer. Reluctantly, she picked up a pencil and said, \"I'll just do a simple sketch for you then.\"\nShe looked up at Louie, carefully studying his features.\nShe had to admit, Louie had that rugged, handsome look that artists loved to draw.\nTaking a deep breath, she steadied herself and began to sketch.\nShe meticulously outlined each line, every stroke done with great care.\nIn no time, a lifelike portrait emerged on the paper.\nThe Louie in the drawing had deep, soulful eyes that seemed to hold endless stories and secrets, drawing anyone in with a single glance.\nHis high, straight nose added a touch of sternness to his face, enhancing his overall rugged appeal.\nThe slight upward curve of his thin lips was just right, exuding a mix of nonchalance and playfulness, as if he didn't care about anything yet controlled everything.\nHis skin on the paper had a unique texture, with a primal intensity that seemed ready to burst forth, making the drawn Louie even more mysterious and captivating than the real one.\nVictoria put down her pencil and exhaled softly, relieved that her years of practice had paid off.\nAt least the drawing looked presentable and wouldn't offend the unpredictable mob boss in front of her.\nLouie remained relaxed in his chair, his eyes flashing with a hint of admiration as he looked at the portrait.\nHe knew he was good-looking, but the version of himself that Victoria had captured had a unique charm.\nIt was as if she had stripped away all his layers, revealing his most genuine and mesmerizing side.\n\"Not bad,\" Louie said, sitting up slightly and taking a closer look at the drawing.\nVictoria lowered her head slightly and softly said, \"Thanks for the compliment.\"\nLouie looked at her, his eyes filled with amusement. \"You're quite talented for a small-time artist. But having good drawing skills is one thing; understanding people is the real talent.\"\nHe put the drawing down, leaned forward, and locked eyes with Victoria.\nInstinctively, Victoria leaned back, her heart racing, but she tried to keep her voice steady. \"I'm just an artist. People are complicated; I don't understand them that well.\"\nLouie chuckled and leaned back in his chair, tapping the armrest rhythmically. \"It's okay if you don't understand now. You'll have plenty of chances to learn.\"\nHe glanced at his watch and said with a light laugh, \"In five minutes, you'll be mine.\"\nThe previously pleasant conversation atmosphere instantly shattered. Victoria bit her lip and muttered, \"I never agreed to any bet or deal.\"\nLouie laughed softly.\nWhen he laughed, he had a somewhat refined look, but the smile never reached his eyes, lacking any warmth.\nHe didn't respond, just leaned back in his chair with a lazy yet confident demeanor, as if he controlled everything.\nPaxton, who had been standing behind him, spoke up, \"Ms. Carter, you're the first person Mr. Hopper has ever set aside an hour for.\"\nVictoria was slightly taken aback. She didn't see it as something to be proud of, only feeling immense pressure.\nLouie glanced at Paxton, his eyes cold. \"Don't speak out of turn.\"\nPaxton quickly lowered his head, repeatedly apologizing.\nLouie turned back to Victoria, a faint smile on his face. \"Formalities must be observed.\"\nIn truth, whether William showed up within the hour didn't matter to him.\nFrom the moment he first saw Victoria, he had made up his mind. He wanted her.\nVictoria didn't know where she found the courage, but she stared straight at Louie, trying to keep her voice calm. \"Mr. Hopper, thank you for the hospitality, but I have no intention of switching men.\"\nLouie merely raised an eyebrow, a mocking smile on his lips. \"I'm giving you a choice so you can accept it willingly. But if you don't appreciate it...\"\nHe paused, then suddenly changed the subject. \"Alvin is your father, right?\"\nHearing that name, Victoria's eyes widened, and she could no longer maintain her composure. She slammed her hands on the table. \"Don't you dare hurt my dad!\"\nLouie shrugged, looking innocent. \"He's quite stubborn, but you seem to misunderstand. I didn't capture him; he's not in my hands.\"",

        "content": "\"No way!\" Victoria's eyes widened in disbelief. She couldn't believe anyone else in Xandria would be bold enough to kidnap a foreigner.\n\"A gang called 'The Iron Crocodiles' has been getting gutsier lately, causing trouble all over Xandria and targeting wealthy foreigners,\" Louie explained calmly, a thin trail of smoke rising from his cigarette, obscuring his face.\n\"And what about them saying my dad hurt some of your guys?\" Victoria's voice rose involuntarily.\n\"That idiot,\" Louie sneered, narrowing his eyes with disdain. \"He's been trying to climb the ranks and take my place. He secretly joined The Iron Crocodiles, causing trouble and using my name to show off, trying to play both sides for his own gain.\"\nVictoria was stunned by the complexity of the situation. Did William know about this?\n\"How could it be like this?\" Victoria frowned deeply.\nLouie stared at her intently, his gaze direct and intense. \"You mentioned fairness before, didn't you? I don't like forcing people. I'll help you save your dad, and you stay by my side. Fair enough, right?\"\nHe glanced at his watch nonchalantly. \"You don't have much time to think. Two minutes left.\"\nVictoria was about to speak when the restaurant door was suddenly thrown open.\nPaxton and his men quickly moved to block the intruder. \"This place is cleared out. Who let you in?\"\nThe newcomer ignored them, swiftly throwing Paxton aside with a shoulder throw.\nVictoria turned in shock, her eyes welling up with tears when she recognized the person.\nLouie remained seated, watching the intruder calmly.\nWilliam strode forward, his long legs quickly bringing him to the table. He pulled out a chair and sat next to Victoria, draping an arm over the back of her chair, half-protecting her.\nHe tilted his chin up slightly, looking at Louie with a careless, confident smile. \"Didn't I tell you to wait for me at the hotel? How could you just run off with another man? Aren't you afraid he'll sell you off?\"\nVictoria was anxious, wanting to ask about Alvin, but the words stuck in her throat.\nWilliam's fingers lightly brushed her shoulder. The gesture seemed casual, yet it carried a hint of reassurance.\nVictoria understood and obediently kept quiet.\nLouie chuckled, the sound echoing in the silent restaurant with a hint of mockery. \"Speaking of which, Mr. Scott, aren't you the other man too?\"\nVictoria, who had just picked up her water glass to calm herself, nearly choked at his words.\nShe turned her head awkwardly, her cheeks flushing, not daring to look at either of them.\nWilliam, however, seemed unfazed, even admitting openly, \"Yeah. But she's completely smitten with me; that's why she can't leave me.\"\nVictoria's eyebrows twitched. Hearing him say that made her feel like a fickle woman, so she decided to just accept the situation and not bother explaining.\nAs they spoke, William took her hand, bringing it to his lips for a light kiss.\nVictoria instinctively tried to pull her hand back but noticed the blood and bruises on his knuckles, evidence of a recent fight.\nHer heart tightened, and she immediately took his hand in both of hers, examining it closely.\nShe opened her mouth but said nothing, simply looking up at William.\nIn that moment, William's gaze softened immensely.\nHe smiled gently, pulling his hand back to ruffle her hair affectionately. \"It's all okay now.\"\n\"Really?\" Victoria's voice trembled, filled with hope.\n\"Yes,\" William confirmed, his fingers gently smoothing her slightly messy hair.\nVictoria lowered her eyes, finally relaxing her tense nerves.\nShe clung to William's hand, refusing to let go.\nWilliam looked down at their intertwined hands, then wrapped her cold hand in his, gently rubbing it.\n\"All okay?\" Louie raised an eyebrow, chuckling softly, breaking the brief moment of warmth. \"If everything's fine, Mr. Scott, why did you come looking for me?\"\nVictoria's unease returned, and she looked at William, her voice low. \"Is something wrong?\"\nWilliam ignored her question, turning to her instead. \"Are you full?\"\nVictoria was taken aback, then nodded instinctively. \"Yes, I'm full.\"\n\"Good.\" William smiled, patting her back gently like comforting a child. \"There's a drink shop across the street. Go check it out.\"\nVictoria frowned, thinking to herself: Is he trying to get rid of me? That's pretty blunt!\nWilliam seemed to read her mind, squeezing her hand affectionately. \"Go on, wait for me there.\"\nThough reluctant, Victoria stood up. Just as she was about to leave, William handed her his wallet. \"Get whatever you want. Don't hold back.\"\nVictoria pouted. If it weren't for the situation, she would have rolled her eyes at him.\nWilliam really treated her like a child!\nThankfully, Louie's men didn't stop her. Victoria obediently left and saw the charming drink shop across the street.\nShe picked a flavor at random and sat inside, watching the restaurant through the large window.\nShe saw William and Louie sitting across from each other, the tension palpable.\nHer brows furrowed, and her heart ached.\nWilliam was strong; he should be fine, right?\nShe wanted to call Daisy to check if Alvin was back, but her phone was dead.\nHow did William find her?\nJust then, Paxton exited the restaurant, followed by Louie.\nLouie glanced in her direction, a meaningful smile on his lips, before getting into his car.\nSoon after, William emerged.\nHe walked straight to the drink shop, and Victoria quickly got up to meet him.\n\"What did you say to him? Are you making a deal?\" Victoria blurted out, her anxiety evident.\nWilliam looked around cautiously, taking her hand and leading her away. \"We reached a small agreement.\"\nVictoria stopped abruptly, staring at him. \"William! He's Louie! The head of an illegal organization!\"",

        "content": "\"So, he's the only one who can handle this.\" William knew he had to lay it all out for Victoria, or she'd never be at ease.\n\"Your dad's in the hands of The Iron Crocodiles right now. They're like a pack of hungry wolves, greedy and totally untrustworthy. The minute we paid the first ransom, they saw us as a goldmine. They demanded a second payment, then a third. When they can't squeeze any more out of us, that's when things get really dangerous.\"\nVictoria's face went pale, her lips trembling as she listened to William.\nHe went on, \"We're in a foreign country, so we gotta be extra careful. To deal with The Iron Crocodiles, we need to use local forces. Louie's been wanting to take them down for a while. I made him a deal: I provide the money, he provides the manpower. He had no reason to say no.\"\nVictoria's heart raced as she asked, her voice shaking, \"So, are we gonna act soon?\"\n\"Pretty much.\" William didn't go into detail. After all, a gang war would be a brutal, bloody affair.\nVictoria didn't ask further, but she had a rough idea of what was coming.\n\"Are you going?\" Victoria looked up, her eyes filled with worry and fear.\nWilliam suddenly bent down, meeting her gaze, and looked deeply into her eyes. \"Do you want me to go?\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together and turned away. \"It's your decision, don't ask me.\"\nBut William gently turned her face back to him, his eyes locking onto hers. \"I've heard that The Iron Crocodiles are all tough guys, armed with heavy weapons, and they're all desperados. Even if I hire mercenaries, casualties are inevitable.\"\n\"Don't go!\" Victoria, as if greatly shocked, grabbed William's arm tightly, her fingers turning white, her eyes full of panic. \"Why does it have to be like this? Maybe there's another way, it doesn't have to be a fight to the death.\"\nWilliam gazed at her and suddenly asked, \"Worried about me? Afraid something will happen to me?\"\nVictoria closed her mouth again, but her face couldn't hide her concern.\nWilliam lowered his eyes slightly, a warm feeling rising in his heart. He whispered, \"It's worth it.\"\n\"What?\" Victoria looked at him, puzzled.\nWilliam gently pried her fingers off his arm, one by one, his expression seemingly casual, but his tone was firm. \"I've never broken a promise to you, and this time is no different.\"\nVictoria felt a heavy weight in her heart, like a stone pressing down.\nShe had so much to say, but looking at William, she couldn't utter a word.\nWilliam, however, seemed oblivious and naturally changed the subject.\nHe leaned in slightly, his warm breath brushing her ear, and chuckled softly. \"Louie told me you said you weren't planning to find another man.\"\nVictoria was stunned.\nShe could hear the hint of hope in his words, but she avoided his gaze, responding with a forced, almost cold rationality. \"I was talking about Samuel.\"\nThe name \"Samuel\" was like a cold barrier, instantly extinguishing the small spark in William's eyes.\nWilliam quietly stared at her, the warmth in his gaze cooling visibly.\nShe could feel him pulling away.\n\"Is that so?\" He responded flatly, his tone devoid of emotion.\nVictoria lowered her eyes and softly replied, her voice barely audible.\nQuinton drove them back, and the two maintained a silent understanding, the car engine's hum the only sound in the confined space.\nBack at the resort, William told her to go up first, saying he had some things to handle.\nVictoria hesitated before getting out of the car, then turned back to caution him. \"Be careful, if...\"\n\"I know.\" William cut her off, signaling Quinton to drive away.\nVictoria stood at the resort entrance, staring at the car's retreating figure for a long time before turning to go inside.\nAs she stepped into the lobby, Giselle hurried over, calling softly, \"Victoria, you have a call.\"\nPuzzled, Victoria walked to the front desk and picked up the phone.\n\"Victoria!\" Samuel's anxious voice came through. \"Why is your phone off?\"\n\"Battery died,\" Victoria explained. \"I was out shopping and didn't notice.\"\nSamuel sighed in relief, and they chatted for a bit.\nFinally, he spoke with a complicated tone. \"I promised to come help you, but something came up here, and I can't leave. I'm sorry, Victoria.\"\n\"Is everything okay?\" Victoria asked, concerned.\nSamuel hesitated before continuing. \"It's nothing major, I'll sort it out soon.\"\nHis studio had been accused of tax evasion and money laundering through high-priced artwork. Though the accusations were false, he was barred from leaving the country until the matter was resolved.\nHe knew it was William's doing.\nAll this just to keep him away from Victoria.\nHearing this, Victoria felt relieved. \"As long as you're okay. I'm fine here, don't worry.\"\nThere was a moment of silence on the other end, followed by a soft laugh.\nSamuel said, \"If people knew how understanding my girlfriend is, they'd be so envious. But I wish you'd act like other girls sometimes, throw a tantrum or get mad at me.\"\nVictoria laughed. \"Alright, I'll be a difficult girlfriend from now on.\"\n\"Great!\" Samuel laughed heartily. \"I look forward to it.\"\nVictoria chuckled. \"Just don't get annoyed with me then.\"\n\"Never. You'll always be my princess.\" Samuel sighed softly. \"Victoria, I miss you.\"\nVictoria paused, then said, \"I miss you too.\"\nAfter hanging up, she turned to see Daisy.\nDaisy, holding a newly bought pack of cigarettes, was leaning against the wall, watching her.\nFor some reason, Victoria felt a pang of guilt.\n\"Let's go eat something,\" Daisy said, taking Victoria's hand. Though Victoria wasn't hungry, she didn't refuse and followed her.\nDaisy had been smoking almost non-stop for the past day and night, even during meals.\nVictoria, having just eaten, only ordered a juice and watched Daisy eat.\nNeither mentioned the plan to rescue Alvin, but it was all they could think about.\nFinally, Daisy put down her utensils, took a deep drag of her cigarette, and said, \"If anything happens to him, I'll move into your place with his ashes.\"",

I've made up my mind about him, but he keeps dodging me,\" Daisy said, taking another drag from her cigarette, the smoke swirling around her. \"If he really dies, at least I'll have done my part. After that, I'll look after you, see you get married, help you with your kids.\"\nAs she spoke, Daisy chuckled, \"Thinking about it, it's kind of funny.\"\nVictoria felt a pang in her heart. How had she never noticed Daisy's deep feelings for Alvin?\nShe reached out and snatched the cigarette from Daisy's hand, extinguishing it in the ashtray. \"Stop talking like that. My dad will come back safe and sound. When he does, I'll make sure he gives you an explanation! If he tries to dodge it, I'll be the first to hold him accountable!\"\nDaisy's face softened into a smile. \"Alright, that's sweet of you. I knew I didn't spoil you for nothing.\"\nAs night fell, enveloping the world in darkness, neither Victoria nor Daisy wanted to sit idly in the room.\nThey sat side by side on the wicker chairs at the resort, quietly waiting. Despite their anxiety, they maintained a calm exterior.\nDaisy's hand unconsciously reached for her cigarette pack again, but Victoria quickly snatched it away, saying firmly, \"In the Carter family, new members aren't allowed to smoke.\"\nDaisy widened her eyes, pretending to be angry. \"You're pulling my leg! I've never heard your dad say that.\"\n\"There is, because I say so,\" Victoria replied seriously.\nDaisy shook her head, half amused, half exasperated. \"You always know how to get to me.\"\nJust then, the sound of a car engine roared closer. A familiar car sped into the resort.\nBefore the car even stopped, Victoria's face changed, and she jumped up, running towards it. \"Quinton!\"\n\"Ms. Carter, get in the car!\" Quinton shouted urgently, not wasting any time.\nVictoria climbed in without hesitation, and Daisy quickly followed.\nAs the car sped off, Quinton explained, \"Mr. Carter is back, but he's injured and at the hospital.\"\nVictoria's mind went blank, a buzzing sound filling her ears. Daisy's face turned as white as a sheet. \"Where is he hurt? Is it serious?\"\n\"I don't know the details. I came straight to get you as soon as I heard.\"\nQuinton, familiar with the roads, quickly got them to the only decent hospital in Xandria.\nVictoria jumped out of the car and immediately spotted Paxton.\n\"Louie sent me to bring you up,\" Paxton said briefly, turning to lead the way.\nVictoria, frantic with worry, ran so fast her hairband fell off, her long hair streaming behind her as she followed Paxton.\nHer usually beautiful face was now full of anxiety, her eyes red and puffy, like a delicate vase on the verge of breaking.\nWhen she reached Louie, he looked at her quietly for a long moment before finally looking away.\n\"Where's my dad?\" she asked, her voice trembling with urgency.\nLouie tilted his head towards a nearby direction.\nAt that moment, Alvin, bandaged up, slowly walked out.\n\"Dad!\" Victoria cried, rushing to his side, supporting him. \"Are you okay? Where are you hurt?\"\nAlvin patted her hand gently. \"I'm fine.\"\nVictoria's eyes filled with tears. \"How can you be fine? You're bleeding.\"\n\"I'm not lying,\" Alvin said, caressing her cheek tenderly. \"It's just a scratch, nothing serious.\"\n\"Thank goodness,\" Victoria sobbed, tears streaming down her face.\nDaisy hurried over, concern etched on her face. \"Alvin, are you alright? Is it bad?\"\nVictoria wiped her tears and stepped aside to give them some space.\nSeeing Daisy's worried expression, Alvin smiled faintly. \"I'm okay.\"\nDaisy finally relaxed, tears flowing freely as she hugged Alvin tightly. \"You scared me. I was so afraid of losing you.\"\n\"I'm sorry, it's all my fault for making you worry,\" Alvin said, his voice full of guilt.\nDaisy clung to him, her nails digging into his back. \"You idiot! Do you think playing hero is cool?\"\nDespite her well-maintained appearance, Daisy was in her forties, and the stress of recent days had taken its toll, fine lines appearing at the corners of her eyes.\nSeeing this vulnerable side of her, Alvin felt a strange pang in his heart. They were both getting older.\nAlvin glanced nervously at Victoria, afraid she might be angry.\nBut Victoria wasn't looking at them. She was searching for William.\nAfter scanning the area, she finally saw Harry entering the room.\nHe had arrived before the action started, but Victoria hadn't noticed him in the rush.\nSeeing him, Victoria rushed over, asking anxiously, \"Harry, where's William?\"\nHarry's face was somber as he pointed to the operating room. \"Mr. Scott is still in surgery.\"\nVictoria felt her legs go weak, almost collapsing.\nLuckily, Louie was quick to catch her.\n\"Surgery?\" Victoria's tears flowed uncontrollably. She grabbed Harry's arm, her voice shaking. \"Is he hurt? Where? How bad is it?\"\nLouie frowned, speaking softly, \"Victoria, calm down.\"\n\"I can't calm down!\" Victoria shouted at Harry. \"Is William seriously hurt? Tell me the truth!\"\nHarry sighed. \"A bullet went through his left abdomen. He needs surgery to remove it.\"\nVictoria felt the world spin, nearly fainting.\nDaisy, overhearing, felt like she had been struck by lightning. \"It's all my fault. If something happens to William, how will I face my late brother and sister-in-law?\"\nShe broke down, sobbing in Alvin's arms.\nAlvin, his brow furrowed, struggled to find the right words to comfort her. After a long pause, he gently pressed her shoulder and sighed. \"He took that bullet for me.\"",

        "content": "Victoria's body shook as she stared at Alvin in disbelief. \"Dad! What did you just say?\"\nWasn't he the one who hated Alvin the most?\nWhy would he risk his life to take a bullet for him?\nHad he lost his mind?\nVictoria stood frozen for a moment before suddenly pushing Louie aside and sprinting towards the operating room.\nThe others quickly followed.\nThe red light above the operating room stayed on for three long hours before finally going out.\nWhen the medical staff emerged, all eyes were fixed on them.\nThe doctor removed his mask, looking exhausted, and spoke at length. \"The bullet pierced his abdomen, but luckily, it didn't hit any vital organs. However, an old wound in his abdomen tore open, causing excessive bleeding. He'll need to stay in the hospital for a while longer.\"\nHearing this, everyone finally breathed a sigh of relief.\nThe doctor then returned to the operating room to finish up.\nVictoria's anxiety finally eased, and tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.\nDaisy hugged her shoulders, silently comforting her.\nAfter crying for a while, Victoria suddenly thought of something. She looked up at Harry and asked suspiciously, \"What old wound? When did he get hurt in the abdomen?\"\n\"Well...\" Harry stammered, avoiding her gaze.\nIt wasn't that he didn't want to tell her; William had strictly forbidden him from mentioning it to Victoria. Otherwise, his salary would be cut in half.\nWith a family to support, how could he survive with half his salary?\nSeeing Harry's hesitation, Victoria was even more certain he was hiding something.\n\"Spit it out!\" Victoria stomped her foot in frustration, urging him.\nDaisy sighed, pulled her to sit down, and patiently explained, \"William's injury was self-inflicted.\"\n\"What?\" Victoria's eyes widened in horror as she looked at Daisy. \"He stabbed himself? Is he out of his mind? Does he have a death wish?\"\nSeeing Victoria's anger, Daisy felt a pang of sadness.\nShe then explained how William had stabbed himself and paid three million dollars to repay Alice for saving his life and to completely break up with her.\nAfter hearing Daisy's explanation, Victoria was silent for a long time, struggling to process the truth.\nNo wonder he had been so tolerant and loving towards Alice; it was because of this.\nVictoria looked at the now darkened light above the operating room, feeling a mix of emotions.\n\"Is he an idiot?\" Victoria muttered to herself.\n'William, this time I owe you my life,' she thought.\nAlvin was taken away by the police. The incident had caused too much commotion, and the proper procedures had to be followed.\nSince he was still on parole and had used special channels to leave the country, Victoria was worried something might go wrong.\nLouie stood up. \"I'll go check on him.\"\nHe glanced towards the hospital room. \"I promised him I'd get you all out safely.\"\n\"Thank you.\" Her response was dry, and she didn't even have the courage to ask what William had promised.\nDaisy and Victoria waited in the hospital corridor all night. When the doctor finally came out to inform them that William was awake and could have visitors, Victoria hesitated.\nShe was afraid to see him.\nHe was the one who had sent Alvin to prison, who had humiliated and manipulated her, but now, he had risked his life to save Alvin.\nShe really didn't know how to face him.\nSoon, Daisy came out and softly said, \"Victoria, he wants to see you.\"\nVictoria's heart tightened. She bit her lip and walked into the hospital room.\nWilliam lay weakly on the bed, his once handsome face was now as pale as a sheet, his lips colorless.\nHis abdomen was slightly raised, likely wrapped in thick bandages.\nHearing her enter, he turned his head with effort and gave her a weak smile. \"If I hadn't asked you to come in, were you planning to just stand outside forever?\"\nVictoria had intended to stay composed in front of him, but as soon as she spoke, her voice cracked with emotion. \"How did it come to this? Didn't I tell you to be extra careful?\"\nWilliam looked at her deeply, remained silent for a moment, and then softly said, \"I was careless.\"\nHe didn't mention taking the bullet for Alvin.\nBut Victoria felt a sharp pain in her heart.\nSeeing her standing there motionless, William reached out his hand and beckoned her. \"Come here.\"\nVictoria fought back her tears, hesitated for a moment, and then slowly walked over to hold his hand.\nWilliam looked at her red eyes, which made him want to pull her into his arms.\nThey held hands, and for a moment, the atmosphere in the room became subtly intimate.\nVictoria broke the silence first, asking softly, \"Are The Iron Crocodiles taken care of?\"\nWilliam half-closed his eyes, his usual sharpness gone, his face looking more vulnerable, evoking a protective instinct.\n\"Yes,\" he replied weakly, his fingers gently stroking her palm.\n\"What kind of deal did you and Louie make? Why is he helping us so much?\" Victoria finally voiced the question that had been bothering her.\nHearing this, William squinted and gave a faint smile. \"Afraid I sold you?\"\nVictoria glanced at him and muttered, \"If you did, I'd rather find my own buyer.\"\nIt was meant as a joke, but William's face darkened, and he tightened his grip on her hand. \"Don't you dare!\"\n\"Why wouldn't I?\" Victoria lowered her head, her voice even softer. \"I owe you such a big favor, how can I ever repay it?\"\n\"Who said you have to repay it?\" William was annoyed, his tone impatient. \"I got hurt because I wanted to, it has nothing to do with you.\"\nVictoria frowned even more, blurting out, \"Can you honestly say you didn't take that bullet for my dad because of me?\"\nWilliam froze.\nThen he turned his face away, muttering, \"Don't flatter yourself. I told you it was an accident, I didn't take it for him.\"\nNo matter who got hurt, even if it was another family member, he wouldn't admit it.\nVictoria regretted asking immediately, feeling incredibly awkward.\nEven if she knew the truth, what did she expect William to say? That he did it for her?\nThen what? She'd say thank you?\nIf that happened, even she would feel insincere.\nNeither of them spoke again, and the room fell into silence.\n\"William!\"\nThe door suddenly burst open.",

        "content": "It was Alice.\nWithout even glancing at Victoria, she rushed straight to William's bedside, her eyes red and her voice trembling with emotion. \"How did this happen? I was so scared when I heard you got hurt!\"\nVictoria hadn't expected her to show up at this moment.\nWilliam frowned slightly, a hint of impatience in his eyes. \"Why are you here?\"\n\"I heard Ms. Scott was in trouble in Xandria, so I thought I'd come to help. My aunt has some pull here. But as soon as I got off the plane, I heard you were hurt.\" Alice spoke while looking at William with concern, her eyes brimming with tears.\nIt was only then that she noticed Victoria in the room. A flash of hostility crossed her eyes, but she didn't act on it. Instead, she greeted Victoria politely, \"Ms. Carter.\"\nThen, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, she asked, \"Could you get me a glass of water?\"\nVictoria almost nodded instinctively, but the words caught in her throat.\nShe quickly regained her composure and said softly, \"The doctor specifically said William can't drink water right now.\"\n\"Oh, I see.\" Alice smiled apologetically at Victoria, then turned her full attention back to William. \"Is the pillow height okay? Do you want me to adjust it? If there's anything else bothering you, let me know, and I'll call the doctor right away.\"\nAlice's attentiveness made it seem like she and William were still a couple in love, even though their engagement had long been called off.\nThis made Victoria feel out of place.\nFeeling awkward, Victoria said softly, \"I'll step out for a bit.\"\nAlice turned to her, smiling understandingly. \"Sure, Ms. Carter. You go rest. I'll take care of things here.\"\nVictoria was about to agree when William looked at her and said coldly, \"Is this how you repay someone who saved your dad's life?\"\nVictoria was stunned. Just a moment ago, he had been stubbornly denying that he saved Alvin. How did he change his tune so quickly?\nBut she didn't get angry. After all, he had a point. She was indeed in the wrong.\nSo, she immediately stepped forward, her attitude becoming particularly attentive. \"I won't leave. I'll stay and take care of you.\"\nAlice lowered her eyes slightly, hiding her complex emotions.\nVictoria didn't have time to guess what Alice was thinking. She said calmly, \"Ms. Garcia, I'll stay here. You've come a long way and must be exhausted. You should go rest.\"\nWilliam, lying in bed, had a barely noticeable smile on his lips, seemingly satisfied with Victoria's response. He then closed his eyes, looking content.\nAlice still wore a smile and replied softly, \"Okay.\"\nAt that moment, she seemed particularly agreeable, completely different from her usual sharpness. Her gentle demeanor matched her appearance, surprising Victoria with the change.\nBack at the hotel, Alice threw a fit.\nHer aunt, Catherine Potts, had just returned from shopping and walked into the room to find Alice throwing things around.\nCatherine raised an eyebrow, walking in slowly in her elegant high heels. \"Now you're worried? I heard you were quite decisive when you agreed to call off the engagement, even more so than your sister.\"\nAlice collapsed onto the sofa, covering her face with her hands, her voice choked with tears. \"He stabbed himself to break off the engagement. What could I do? If I pushed him any further, I'd end up like Ella, completely despised by him. I just didn't want to burn all bridges, leaving myself some room.\"\nCatherine removed her scarf and sat at the vanity to take off her earrings. \"And what was the result? You can't be soft-hearted with men! You went through so much for him. You should have insisted on not breaking off the engagement, and if he pushed you, you could have threatened to jump off a building or slit your wrists. I don't believe he would have continued to confront you. You gave him freedom, and now look at you. You're not even his fiancée anymore, and you have to watch others' faces when you visit him.\"\nAlice bit her lip, her eyes red as she looked up. \"Aunt Catherine, what's the point of saying this now? It only makes me feel worse.\"\nCatherine stood up, walked over, and patted her shoulder gently. \"Alright, crying here won't help. You should think about how to get that Victoria away from him.\"\nAlice took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down. \"Aunt Catherine, I want to stay here for a while.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" Catherine looked at her, her gaze scrutinizing. \"I arranged for you to meet some outstanding young men. Don't you want to give them a chance? Maybe after meeting them, you'll forget about William. A smart woman doesn't stubbornly choose just one man.\"\nAlice shook her head firmly. \"In this life, my heart belongs only to him!\"\nSeeing Alice's determination, Catherine sighed softly. \"Then you need to be clear-headed. You're already at a disadvantage.\"\n\"Not necessarily.\" Alice composed herself, lifting her head with a determined look in her eyes. \"Maybe staying by his side as a friend will give me more opportunities.\"\nCatherine didn't fully understand the deeper meaning of this, but she didn't interfere much in young people's romantic entanglements. She just reminded Alice, \"Keep your priorities straight. I've heard rumors that your stepmother is secretly transferring assets. Be cautious.\"\nHearing this, Alice's expression turned thoughtful. After a moment, she smiled slightly. \"Got it.\"\nBy midday, William was allowed to drink water and have some liquid food.\nVictoria fed him some soup, but he couldn't drink much.\nAs the painkillers wore off, the burning sensation from his wound grew more intense.\nThe pain, though not lasting long, was sharp and relentless, making it hard to bear.\nWilliam kept his eyes tightly shut, his brows furrowed, and beads of sweat formed on his forehead, trickling down his face.\nVictoria had already consulted the doctor and knew he was in agony from his wound.\nSeeing him in such pain, she quickly ran to the bathroom, soaked a towel in warm water, and carefully wiped the sweat from his forehead.\nWilliam's eyelids fluttered, and he slowly opened his eyes, his gaze hazy as if looking through a mist.\n\"Are you tired?\" His voice was dry and hoarse.\n\"I'm not tired.\" Victoria shook her head gently.\nShe walked quickly to the table, picked up a water jug, poured a glass of water, and inserted a straw, bringing it to his lips. \"Drink some water to soothe your throat.\"\n\"I want to sit up.\" William tried to move, attempting to prop himself up.\n\"You can't! What if your wound opens up?\" Victoria quickly reached out to stop him.\n\"I'm not that fragile.\" William gritted his teeth, his voice muffled, still trying to exert himself.\nSeeing his determination, Victoria had no choice but to help.\nShe supported his back with one hand and pressed the button to raise the bed with the other.\nThen she grabbed a pillow and placed it behind him to make him more comfortable.\nWilliam's mind cleared a bit, and he looked at Victoria's tired face, frowning again. \"Come here.\"\n\"What?\" Victoria was puzzled.\nShe obediently took a couple of steps closer to the bed.\nWilliam reached out, pulled her to his side, and moved over, making room on the bed. \"Lie down and rest for a while.\"",

        "content": "\"No, no.\" Victoria waved her hands frantically, shaking her head. \"I'll just crash on the couch once you fall asleep.\"\n\"You won't,\" William said, dead certain. He knew her too well.\nShe had no intention of sleeping. She was scared she'd sleep too deeply and miss any noise from his side. So, she planned to stay up all night.\n\"Get up here,\" William commanded, leaving no room for argument.\nVictoria stubbornly shook her head, refusing to comply.\nTrue to his usual forceful nature, William didn't waste time arguing. He reached out, grabbed her arm, and tried to pull her onto the bed.\n\"I really don't need to,\" Victoria struggled, accidentally tugging at his abdominal wound. William cried out in pain, his face contorting.\n\"Are you okay?\" Victoria asked anxiously, her voice full of guilt.\nWilliam looked up at her weakly. \"At a time like this, you're still gonna argue with me?\"\nVictoria bit her lip, hesitated for a moment, and then slowly sat down on the edge of the bed.\nSeeing this, William extended his arm, pulled her into his embrace, and gently covered them both with the blanket. \"Sleep,\" he said hoarsely.\nVictoria lay there, her body tense, not daring to move for fear of hurting him again.\nHer rare compliance made William smile faintly. He tightened his arm around her and slowly brought his lips to her forehead.\nVictoria clutched the blanket tightly, her heart racing. She closed her eyes, pretending to be asleep.\nThe atmosphere between them was awkward yet intimate.\nIt wasn't just because she was Samuel's girlfriend. There were too many misunderstandings and conflicts between her and William. Getting together was easier said than done.\n\"Victoria,\" William suddenly spoke, his voice slow. \"I didn't ask her to come.\"\nVictoria was silent for a moment before responding softly, \"Even if you did, what does it have to do with me?\"\nFeeling William's grip tighten, Victoria quickly said, \"Don't move around.\"\nWilliam narrowed his eyes, his tone cold and a bit petulant. \"Didn't you say it has nothing to do with you? Why do you care? If my wound opens and I die from the pain, it's my own fault.\"\n\"You!\" Victoria turned her head angrily, glaring at him. \"William, can you be a little more mature?\"\n\"Don't you know if I'm mature or not?\" William deliberately misinterpreted her words, pressing his hips forward.\nIf it weren't for his injury, Victoria would have kicked him off the bed. This guy didn't look like someone who had just come back from the brink of death.\nIgnoring the risk of hurting him, she angrily turned her back to him, thinking to herself that no matter how careful she was, she couldn't stop him from acting recklessly. Clearly, he wasn't hurt badly enough if he still had the energy to mess around.\nWilliam, however, was relentless. He slowly moved closer and stubbornly pulled her back into his arms.\nVictoria frowned impatiently. \"Don't push yourself at a time like this.\"\nWilliam raised an eyebrow, grunted behind her, and without a word, pulled one of her hands under the blanket.\n\"You...\" Victoria started, but her words were cut off when her fingers touched something warm and hard.\nShe jerked her hand back as if electrocuted, her face turning bright red. \"William!\"\nWilliam, sounding genuinely exhausted, rested his head on her back. \"Don't overthink it. It's just a normal physiological reaction.\"\nVictoria's face burned, even her ears felt like they were on fire.\nAs the room grew quiet, she assumed he had fallen asleep and let out a sigh of relief.\nLittle did she know, the deep eyes behind her were silently watching her, filled with intense and deep emotions.\nIn the morning, the doctor came to check on William.\nHe gently pushed open the door and saw William sitting by the bed.\nWilliam turned his head and made a shushing gesture to the doctor.\nVictoria was still sound asleep.\nThe doctor understood and couldn't help but smile, whispering, \"It's rare to see such a considerate husband these days.\"\nWilliam lowered his eyes slightly, not bothering to explain his relationship with Victoria.\nThe doctor did a quick check-up and was amazed at William's rapid recovery. At this rate, he could be discharged in less than a week.\nAs soon as the doctor left, the phone on the bedside table lit up. Victoria had set it to silent, and the screen showed \"Samuel.\"\nWilliam glanced at it, raised an eyebrow, and casually answered the call, his tone lazy. \"Who is this?\"\nThe other end of the line went silent.\nWilliam's lips curled into a satisfied smile. \"Looking for Victoria?\"\nHe could hear the deep breath on the other end before Samuel, trying to stay calm, said, \"Let me speak to Victoria.\"\nSamuel skipped the pleasantries, clearly recognizing William's voice.\nWilliam glanced at the sleeping Victoria and said truthfully, \"She's still asleep.\"\nThe words hit Samuel like a bomb.\nSamuel's grip on his pen tightened until it snapped in two.\n\"William!\" Samuel said through gritted teeth. \"She's my girlfriend!\"\nWilliam held the phone, a mocking smile on his face. \"So what? I don't care about that. She's always been my woman.\"\nSamuel, struggling to control his anger, said coldly, \"William, don't you think your methods are despicable? You had people cause trouble for me in Silvermist City just to keep me away from her, didn't you?\"\n\"Yes,\" William admitted openly, not hiding his devious intentions.\nSamuel, using all his willpower to stay calm, said, \"Aren't you afraid I'll tell Victoria what you've done?\"\nWilliam laughed dismissively. \"Do you have any proof?\"\n\"You!\" Samuel growled.\nBefore Samuel could say more, William hung up the phone without hesitation.\nWhen the phone rang again, he simply turned it over and placed it face down on the table.\nVictoria slept deeply, having been anxious and sleepless for days.\nWhen she woke up, she instinctively reached for the spot next to her.\n\"William!\"\nFinding it empty, she sat up quickly, threw off the blanket, and got out of bed barefoot.\n\"William?\" She hurriedly checked the bathroom, but it was empty too.\n\"William! Where are you?\"\nShe was about to rush out the door when it opened from the outside, and she ran straight into a warm embrace.",

I woke up and you weren't here.\"\nBefore William could respond, the young nurse behind him covered her mouth and giggled. \"You two must be newlyweds, huh? Can't stand being apart for even a second?\"\nVictoria, still groggy from sleep, took a moment to process the nurse's teasing and stammered out a denial.\nWilliam's handsome face held a faint smile. \"Don't tease her, she's easily embarrassed.\"\nThe nurse giggled again, clearly excited, as she helped William into the room. While changing his bandages, she whispered to Victoria, \"Your husband is so good to you. This morning, when we took him for tests, he wouldn't let us wake you.\"\nVictoria's face turned bright red.\nShe was supposed to be the one taking care of him, yet she had slept so soundly.\nOverwhelmed with guilt, she didn't even try to explain their relationship.\nWilliam leaned back on the hospital bed, his eyes filled with a gentle smile as he looked at Victoria.\nOnce the nurse left the room, he reached out his hand and softly said, \"Come here.\"\nVictoria looked at him warily, refusing to move.\n\"Alright,\" William said, a barely-there smile playing on his lips. \"Then I'll come to you.\"\n\"No, don't!\" Victoria exclaimed, worried he might aggravate his injury. She quickly stepped forward. \"Just tell me what you need, and I'll help you.\"\nWilliam, still in the motion of getting out of bed, looked up at her with a probing gaze. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes,\" Victoria nodded firmly, her guilt driving her to make up for falling asleep last night.\nWilliam's thick eyelashes fluttered slightly before he raised his arm and gently placed it on her shoulder, pulling her into an embrace. His voice was low and tender. \"I just want to hold you for a while, nothing else.\"\nVictoria was caught off guard by his sudden hug, her hands instinctively bracing against the bed to avoid pressing on his abdominal wound.\n\"Let me hold you for a bit,\" he whispered in her ear, a hint of sadness in his voice. \"Let me know you're still here.\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes, her emotions a mix of feelings she couldn't quite name, her heart swelling with a touch of bitterness.\n\"William!\"\nThe door suddenly burst open, and Daisy walked in briskly.\nSeeing the scene inside, she turned to leave, \"We can talk later...\"\nBut before she could finish, someone roughly pushed her aside.\nAlvin stormed into the room, his face dark. William, however, remained calm, his gaze indifferent as if he wasn't holding Victoria in his arms.\nVictoria, startled by the commotion, quickly turned her head.\n\"Dad!\" She looked like a child caught doing something wrong, standing up abruptly and stammering.\nWilliam's hand suddenly grasped hers, and she looked at him, confused.\nHe smiled gently, signaling her to stay calm.\nAlvin, seeing this, was so furious he nearly fainted. He glared at Victoria and barked, \"Victoria! Go back to the hotel now!\"\nHe grabbed her hand, trying to drag her out.\nWilliam frowned, attempting to stand but wincing in pain.\nVictoria, worried, shook off Alvin's hand and looked at William anxiously. \"William, don't move.\"\n\"Relax,\" William said, trying to comfort her despite the pain. \"It's okay, you should go back to the hotel. I'll be fine on my own.\"\nVictoria couldn't bring herself to leave, especially with William so badly injured. What if they had a conflict?\nAfter all, William got hurt helping her and saving Alvin. She couldn't just leave him.\nDetermined, Victoria looked at Alvin and said loudly, \"Dad, he's hurt. You can't mess with him.\"\nAlvin was stunned, looking at Victoria in disbelief. \"You're defending him?\"\nAnd why did she assume he would mess with an injured man?\nBehind Victoria, William's eyes narrowed slightly, a smug smile on his face, like a cat that got the cream.\nDaisy's expression wasn't much better. Couldn't William be a bit more restrained?\n\"I'm not defending him, just stating the facts,\" Victoria insisted, standing firmly in front of Alvin, arms outstretched to block him from William. \"Dad, can't this wait until he's healed?\"\nWilliam coughed weakly, looking extremely frail but trying to appear nonchalant. \"Victoria, I'm fine. You're tired, go rest. I can manage.\"\nThe more he acted like this, the more Victoria refused to move, determined to protect him.\nDaisy, meanwhile, kept her eyes on Alvin. She probably just came to check if William was okay.\nVictoria certainly didn't trust Daisy to take care of William.\nSeeing William's act, Daisy twitched her eyebrow. She couldn't believe this was her usually aloof nephew.\nAnd Victoria, so determined to protect him, made Daisy shake her head. He could only fool someone as naive as Victoria.\nBut looking at Alvin, things seemed dire.\nAlvin's face was livid, clearly on the verge of exploding.\nThe angrier he got, the more Victoria refused to leave him alone with William.\n\"Dad, whatever you need to say, can it wait until he's better? If you want to scold him, do it when he's healed,\" Victoria said, standing her ground. \"He needs to rest.\"\nAlvin's eyes widened in disbelief. \"What did you say?\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together and shook her head firmly. \"I said, no one can touch him today!\"\n\"Victoria!\" Alvin's voice grew harsher. \"Are you rebelling?\"\n\"No...\"\nVictoria wanted to explain, but Daisy quickly intervened, smiling to ease the tension. \"Then please take care of William. We'll go.\"\nShe reached for Alvin, who stood still, and glared at him. \"Are you coming or not?\"",

He was always tough and never backed down from a challenge.\nThen, he turned to Victoria, his gaze softening instantly.\nVictoria stood there, stunned, watching Alvin leave in a huff, feeling a bit lost.\nShe mumbled to herself, \"This is bad. Looks like I really made Dad mad this time.\"\nWilliam, however, thought to himself, 'So what if he's mad? Worst case, you won't go back home, and I'll take care of you!'\nBut he was smart enough to know that saying this out loud would definitely cause a rift between them.\nJust then, the doctor walked in with more medication for William.\nVictoria quickly composed herself and moved to the bedside.\n\"You didn't sleep well last night. Get some rest now, I'll stay here with you,\" she said softly.\nWilliam didn't argue, a faint smile playing on his lips. \"Alright, I didn't sleep well holding you last night anyway.\"\n\"You!\" Victoria's face turned red as she glared at him. \"Stop talking nonsense!\"\n\"Isn't it true?\" William teased, his eyes twinkling. \"You were clinging to me pretty tightly while you slept.\"\n\"Get lost!\" Victoria snapped, embarrassed. \"William, can you be serious for once?\"\nShe had never realized he could be so shameless!\n\"Okay,\" William agreed readily, though his deep, starry eyes still sparkled with mischief.\nWilliam slept deeply, even after three IV bags had been administered. He still hadn't woken up.\nVictoria asked a nurse to keep an eye on him while she went out to get lunch.\nWhen she returned, she ran into Louie at the door of the hospital room.\n\"Louie?\"\nLouie was there with Hayden, and Paxton was carrying a basket of fresh fruit.\nIt was quite a surprise to see him visiting.\nLouie was dressed in a gray suit today, his shirt collar open, revealing his attractive collarbone and Adam's apple.\nHe looked quite dashing, though a bit flashy.\nLouie smiled slightly at her and naturally took the food from her hands.\n\"No need, I can carry it myself. It's no trouble,\" Victoria instinctively protested.\n\"Let's go in,\" Louie said, taking the food and handing it to Paxton, then confidently leading the way.\nVictoria followed him.\nBefore they even opened the door, they heard a woman's exaggerated voice from inside.\n\"How can you not have eaten yet? Is this how she take care of you? William, I'm here, you could have just called me! Ms. Carter is young and inexperienced, how can you rely on her?\"\nVictoria frowned.\nLouie glanced back at her.\nRecognizing Alice's voice, Victoria shrugged helplessly and whispered, \"His ex-fiancée.\"\nLouie raised an eyebrow, understanding.\nHe then looked at Victoria with interest. \"You two have quite the complicated relationship. You have a boyfriend, and he has an ex-fiancée.\"\nVictoria felt a bit embarrassed.\n\"Why aren't you coming in?\" William's voice called from inside.\nLouie turned back, a meaningful smile on his lips.\nHe then pushed the door open and walked in. \"Mr. Scott, I'm here to collect on your promise.\"\nVictoria followed him into the room, nodding politely at Alice. \"Ms. Garcia.\"\nPaxton placed the fruit basket and food gently on the table and then stepped back quietly.\nAlice glanced at the food on the table, frowning slightly, her tone a bit reproachful. \"Ms. Carter, William is a patient. Are you planning to feed him this junk food?\"\nVictoria knew it wasn't ideal. She smiled awkwardly and explained, \"I've been at the hospital all night and didn't have time to go back and make a nutritious meal. Plus, the hotel I'm staying at isn't very convenient.\"\nAlice laughed softly, though her smile carried an unclear meaning. \"It's alright. Luckily, I brought some soup.\"\nShe quickly served the soup from a thermos. \"Ms. Carter, you've been here all night. You must be exhausted. Why don't you go rest? I'll take over.\"\nVictoria was actually tempted.\nWilliam shot her a look and casually asked, \"Are you tired?\"\nFeeling guilty under his gaze, Victoria quickly shook her head. \"Not tired.\"\nAlice's hand paused slightly, but she maintained her gentle smile. \"William, have some soup.\"\nLouie, sitting on the sofa, watched the scene unfold with quiet amusement.\nWilliam glanced at the bowl of soup. Alice said softly, \"This soup is very nutritious. I borrowed the hotel's kitchen early this morning to make it. Even though staying at a hotel is inconvenient, I just cared about you, so nothing felt too difficult.\"\nLouie found it interesting and looked at Victoria with a knowing smile.\nVictoria finally caught on. Alice was subtly implying that she didn't care enough.\nWilliam held the bowl of soup but didn't drink it. He looked up at Victoria. \"Come here.\"\nVictoria walked over, puzzled. \"What is it?\"\nWithout a word, he pushed the bowl of soup towards her. \"Drink it.\"\nVictoria was taken aback and instinctively stepped back. \"This is for you, from Ms. Garcia. It's not right for me to drink it. Besides, I'm not the one who needs to recover.\"\nAlice's smile instantly turned cold. She moved to a spot where William couldn't see her and glared at Victoria.\nUnder her glare, Victoria didn't dare drink it.\nBesides, she genuinely thought William was being unreasonable.\nNo matter what, it was a kind gesture from Alice.\nEven if he didn't accept it, he shouldn't waste trash her kindness like that.\n\"Who says you don't need it?\" William said slowly, his tone teasing. \"You were more exhausted than I was last night.\"\nThat one sentence made the atmosphere even more tense.\nVictoria glared at William, her eyes full of warning, signaling him to stop talking nonsense.\nAlice's fingers dug into her palm. In the past, she would have stormed out in anger.\nBut now, as his ex-girlfriend, she knew she couldn't overreact.\nSo, she suppressed her anger and bitterness, forcing a smile. \"Ms. Carter, William cares about you. Just drink it. I'll make more for him later.\"\nAt that moment, Louie stood up leisurely and said, \"I can tell from the smell that Ms. Garcia is a great cook.\"\nHe picked up the bowl of soup and smiled at Alice. \"Mind if I try it, Ms. Garcia?\"",

        "content": "With that, he tilted his head back and downed the soup in one gulp.\n\"Not bad at all,\" Louie said, setting the bowl down and casting a quick glance at William.\nWilliam returned the look with a brief, indifferent glance.\nThen, William turned to Alice. \"You should head back now.\"\nAlice bit her lower lip, forcing a polite smile. \"Alright, take care.\"\nOnce she left the room, Victoria couldn't hold back any longer. \"Weren't you a bit too harsh on her? She was just trying to be nice.\"\nWilliam's gaze turned colder, tinged with impatience. \"You know what she's after, don't you?\"\n\"That's exactly why I think you were wrong.\"\n\"So, you think I should accept her kindness, knowing she still has feelings for me, and let her keep hoping? What kind of behavior is that?\" William raised an eyebrow, his tone dripping with sarcasm.\nVictoria was momentarily speechless, unsure how to respond.\nLouie chimed in from the side, \"It's just typical scumbag behavior.\"\nWilliam's lips curled into a half-smile. \"See? Sometimes, you women are just impossible to please.\"\nVictoria's chest heaved with anger, but she couldn't find the words to retort. She turned to Louie, her tone now cold and distant, a stark contrast to her earlier warmth when she called him \"Mr. Hopper.\"\n\"When did you two become so in sync? Whatever, I guess I'm the third wheel here. I'll go find the doctor.\"\nWith that, she stormed out of the room.\nLouie watched her leave, chuckling softly. \"Lucky you, having two beautiful women interested in you.\"\nWilliam raised an eyebrow, giving him a wry smile. \"Want that luck?\"\n\"No thanks, I couldn't handle it.\" Louie sat back down, his expression turning serious. \"Alvin's situation is under control. He can leave anytime.\"\nWilliam straightened up slightly, a hint of admiration in his eyes. \"I trust you to get things done. You're efficient.\"\n\"Cut the crap. Now it's your turn to keep your promise,\" Louie said, his gaze intense.\n\"Don't worry,\" William said with a smirk. \"I promised to take down The Iron Crocodiles and unify Xandria's underground. I'll make it happen.\"\nLouie nodded, then added, \"One more thing.\"\n\"Go on,\" William said nonchalantly.\n\"My people found out that some of the guys who kidnapped Alvin and attacked you came from Crystalia,\" Louie said, his eyes narrowing with a dangerous glint. \"You should be careful.\"\nWilliam lowered his gaze, hiding the sharpness in his eyes.\nWilliam's recovery was swift. In just four days, he was up and moving around as if nothing had happened.\nVictoria stayed by his side the whole time, looking surprisingly refreshed rather than exhausted. William had Harry bring in local delicacies every day and even arranged a comfortable bed for her, which had resulted in her gaining a bit of weight.\nThat afternoon, Alvin called, giving a final ultimatum. He had booked a flight for the next morning and wanted Victoria to leave with him.\nAfter hanging up, Victoria looked at William, hesitating before speaking softly. \"William, my dad booked a flight for tomorrow morning. He wants me to go with him.\"\nWilliam was working on his phone, but his movements froze, and his expression darkened.\nHe gripped his phone tightly, finally forcing out a few words through gritted teeth. \"What's the rush?\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes, explaining quietly, \"I've been away for a while. I need to get back to work and prepare for the University of Aesthetics Shine entrance exam.\"\n\"Can't you prepare for the exam here?\" William scoffed, slamming his phone onto the table. \"He's doing this on purpose, just to keep you away from me!\"\nWilliam spent the rest of the afternoon in a foul mood, barely responding to anyone who tried to talk to him.\nThat evening, when Harry brought dinner, William didn't even glance at it. He walked straight to the window, staring outside, not touching a single bite.\nVictoria was worried and frustrated. She approached William, speaking softly. \"You should eat something. You're not fully recovered yet.\"\nWilliam whipped around, his eyes blazing with anger. \"Eat? How can I eat when he's taking you away, and you're just going along with it?\"\nVictoria was getting angry too. She bit her lip. \"It's my dad's decision. What can I do?\"\n\"Can't you stand up to him?\" William's voice rose. \"Do you even care about me?\"\n\"Stop being unreasonable!\" Victoria stomped her foot, turning away from him, not wanting to argue anymore.\nThe tension between them lasted into the night, the atmosphere in the room suffocating.\nIn the middle of the night, William suddenly cried out in pain.\nVictoria, who was a light sleeper, woke up immediately and sat up in a panic. \"What's wrong?\"\nWilliam clutched his wound, his face contorted in pain. \"I think it reopened.\"\nVictoria hurriedly turned on the light and leaned in to check.\nIn that moment, William grabbed her and pulled her into the bed, pressing his head against her shoulder.\n\"Victoria, I'm sorry,\" William's voice was hoarse. \"I just can't stand the thought of you leaving. It kills me to think you'll be gone tomorrow and belong to someone else.\"\nVictoria's body trembled. She opened her mouth but couldn't find the words to say.\nThere were too many issues between them-family, past entanglements-all weighing her down like a ton of bricks.\nSeeing her silence, William's heart ached. He sat up, cupping her face and kissing her.\nVictoria was startled, instinctively wanting to push him away, but afraid of hurting his wound. She struggled slightly, then stopped.\nWilliam, seeing no resistance, deepened the kiss, his hand moving to her waist and slowly sliding upward.\nVictoria felt his touch, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\"William!\" she finally cried out. \"Are you crazy? You're still injured!\"\n\"I'm crazy,\" William's voice was husky and seductive. \"Crazy at the thought of losing you.\"\nHis breathing grew heavier, his body pressing against hers.\nVictoria, pinned beneath him, couldn't muster the strength to push him away.\nWilliam's hand slipped under her shirt, his rough fingers caressing her smooth skin, sending shivers through her.\nVictoria, both embarrassed and angry, glared at him. \"William! You jerk!\"\nHe chuckled lowly. \"I'm a jerk who wants to kiss you and make love to you.\"",

As he teased her, he kept asking, \"You like me, don't you?\"\nVictoria remained silent, desperately trying to suppress herself.\nSuddenly, he lifted his head, pressing his forehead against hers, his voice low and tender, \"Tell me, do you like me?\"\nShe shook her head, lips tightly pressed together.\nWilliam's hand slipped under her shirt, kneading her soft breast through the thin fabric.\nShe had gained some weight recently, shedding her previously thin frame. Her already ample chest had become even fuller, feeling better than ever in his hands.\nAs she struggled, the buttons on her shirt popped open, exposing her rosy nipples to the air, an irresistible sight that made William's breathing grow heavier.\n\"Good girl,\" he murmured, holding her shoulders down. He then cupped her breasts, taking one nipple into his mouth, licking and tasting it.\nVictoria's body went limp, and she was unable to push him away. She gave up struggling, letting him do as he pleased.\nWilliam's fingers trailed down her flat, firm stomach, moving lower.\nHis breath grew hotter, his voice hoarse, \"Tell me, do you like me?\"\nHis voice was so enticing that Victoria lost all reason, finally whispering, \"Yes.\"\nWilliam smiled, his long fingers slipping under her skirt, shamelessly teasing her.\nVictoria couldn't help but moan, her face flushed.\nHis fingers skillfully played with her most sensitive spot.\nAt the intimate touch, Victoria found her eyes welling up with tears, her long lashes damp, making her look both pitiful and alluring.\nHer beautiful face was now tinged with an unnatural flush, her eyes filled with a seductive hue.\n\"William, don't touch there, it tickles.\"\nWilliam didn't stop. He bit her earlobe, whispering, \"Where? Let me check.\"\n\"No,\" Victoria protested with a sob, but her body betrayed her, legs straightening and hands clinging to William's neck.\nWilliam ignored her protests. Once he had stretched her enough, he quickly undressed, revealing his painfully hard erection, rubbing it against her wet entrance.\nJust then, there was a knock on the door, followed by the concerned voice of the night nurse, \"Mr. Scott, I heard some noise from your room. Are you okay? Do you need help?\"\nVictoria was startled, trying to push William away, but he held her firmly, not letting go.\n\"Just had a little argument with my girlfriend. Everything's fine now. You can go back to your station,\" William replied hoarsely.\n\"Alright,\" the nurse responded, her footsteps fading away.\nVictoria was about to breathe a sigh of relief when William took advantage of her moment of relaxation, thrusting into her hard.\nBoth of them groaned, the intense pleasure making their heads spin.\nVictoria clung to the bedsheets, her insides being ruthlessly pounded, her sensitive flesh rubbed mercilessly by his hard length. Her G-spot was hit repeatedly, making her forget her earlier coldness, now only able to cry out for him to be gentler.\nHer reactions only encouraged William further.\nSeeing Victoria's desperate expression, William leaned down, holding her trembling body, planting small kisses on her beautifully shaped shoulder blades and rounded shoulders.\nVictoria whimpered, her legs tightly wrapped around his lean waist, her hips twisting to escape the overwhelming pleasure.\nTheir bodies were tightly connected, and she could feel his hard length relentlessly thrusting inside her.\nVictoria was exhausted, her mind blank.\nIgnoring the pain from his abdominal wound, William straightened up, gripping Victoria's slim waist, thrusting in and out rapidly, his large head repeatedly hitting her G-spot, making her entrance swell.\nAfter dozens of fierce thrusts, William finally reached his climax, the hot liquid making Victoria's body shudder, sending her into a powerful orgasm.\nVictoria collapsed, completely drained.\nShe closed her eyes, her body still trembling slightly.\nWilliam's large hand remained on her chest, his fingers tracing her rosy nipples.\n\"Get off me!\" Victoria panted, using the last of her strength to weakly push William away.\nWilliam grunted, his forehead covered in sweat.\nIt was then that Victoria noticed the blood seeping through the bandage on his abdomen, clearly indicating his wound had reopened.\nPanic set in as she hurriedly tried to help him up, \"William, are you okay?\"\nWilliam propped himself up, his gaze deep, his voice raspy, \"What do you think?\"\nVictoria gritted her teeth, snapping, \"You just had to go through with it!\"\n\"It's your fault,\" he said, looking at the hickeys on her body, his Adam's apple bobbing, \"I get so turned on just seeing you.\"\nVictoria blushed furiously at his shameless words, unable to respond.\nWilliam stared at her flushed cheeks for a moment before leaning down to kiss her lips.\n\"Baby,\" he called softly, each syllable like a feather brushing against Victoria's nerves, making her body go weak and her heart race.\n\"Let go,\" Victoria turned her head away, \"I need to clean up and get the doctor to re-bandage you.\"\nWith that, she got out of bed, quickly cleaned herself up in the bathroom, changed into a fresh nightgown, and opened the window to air out the room.\nShe then returned to the bed, tidied up, and cleaned away any traces of their activities.\nFinally, she dressed William and pressed the call button.\nWilliam leaned back against the bed, watching Victoria's busy figure, feeling a strange flutter in his heart.",

        "content": "Soon, the doctor and nurses rushed in.\nThe doctor approached with a serious expression, carefully removing the bandage from William's wound to check the situation.\nVictoria stood nearby, her eyes fixed on the doctor's every move.\n\"The wound's opened up a bit, but it's not too bad. We just need to clean it and rebandage,\" the doctor said, easing some of Victoria's worry.\nThe nurses quickly prepared the necessary medical tools and supplies, and the doctor began to meticulously clean and stitch up William's wound.\nWilliam remained silent, not even flinching, as if he couldn't feel the pain.\nAfter finishing, the doctor advised, \"He needs to stay calm for the next few days. His body is still recovering, so he must rest and avoid any further injuries.\"\nTurning to Victoria, the doctor added, \"You've been taking good care of him, but make sure he doesn't have any more issues tonight.\"\nVictoria nodded repeatedly. After the doctor and nurses left, she slowly sat by the bed, her head lowered, avoiding William's gaze.\n\"Victoria,\" William called softly, reaching out to hold her hand, but she instinctively pulled away.\n\"Don't move. Just lie down and rest,\" Victoria's voice carried a hint of distance. She knew that all this chaos stemmed from their complicated and entangled feelings.\nShe couldn't let go of her concern for William, yet she couldn't go against Alvin's wishes. She felt utterly exhausted.\nWilliam felt a pang of sadness as she pulled away. He was about to say something when he saw Victoria stand up and walk to the window, turning her back to him.\n\"Victoria, I just don't want you to leave,\" William broke the silence, his voice low and hoarse.\nVictoria's shoulders trembled slightly. She took a deep breath, trying to calm her emotions. \"William, don't say anything more. Just focus on getting better.\"\nThey fell into a long silence, the quiet room filled only with their breaths.\nVictoria suddenly felt suffocated.\nAfter a long while, she spoke, \"William, you know that no matter how long we stay here, we eventually have to go back.\"\nOnce they returned, their problems would once again loom between them.\nUnless Alvin wasn't the one responsible for his parents' deaths, the rift between them would never change.\nWilliam's face darkened at her words.\nThey remained in a standoff for a long time. Just as Victoria was about to turn off the lights and go to bed, William's slightly hoarse voice came from behind her.\n\"If I said...\"\nVictoria turned to look at him.\nWilliam gazed deeply into her eyes, his lips parting slightly, but he swallowed the words that were on the tip of his tongue.\nHe knew that once some things were said, it would be like opening Pandora's box, impossible to close again.\nHe feared adding more pressure on Victoria and was even more afraid that the unresolved truth would shatter the remaining warmth between them.\nAfter a long pause, he finally looked away, staring at the ceiling, his voice barely a whisper, \"Nothing, go to sleep.\"\nVictoria sensed something was off, a wave of unease washing over her.\nThat night, though they were in the same room, it felt like an invisible chasm separated them, each lost in their own thoughts, unable to sleep.\nThe next morning, Victoria got up early, quickly freshened up, and began packing her things.\nWilliam pretended to be asleep, secretly watching her busy figure, his heart a mix of emotions.\nWhen Victoria zipped up her suitcase, he slowly sat up, his voice raspy, \"Are you really leaving?\"\nVictoria paused, not turning around, and replied softly, \"Yeah, my dad's waiting for me.\"\nWilliam forced a smile, hiding his sorrow, \"Have a safe trip.\"\nVictoria bit her lip, dragging her suitcase as she left the hospital.\nWhen Daisy entered the room, William was standing by the window, his silhouette looking thin yet still proud, exuding a sense of aloofness.\nHis eyes were cold, watching the figure below gradually disappear.\n\"Stop looking. For Alvin, having Victoria stay here for so many days was already pushing it,\" Daisy said softly.\nWilliam frowned, turning to her with a hint of displeasure, \"What did he do to win you over?\"\nDaisy scoffed, her face full of disdain, \"If you weren't my nephew, I wouldn't have supported Victoria seeing you. I'm ashamed of what you did to her before!\"\nWilliam's face grew darker, gritting his teeth, \"I regret saving him.\"\n\"You saved Victoria's biological father. As long as that blood tie exists, you have no choice!\" Daisy's voice carried a hint of helplessness.\nWilliam understood her point, his brow furrowed, feeling frustrated.\nAfter a moment, he turned to Daisy, \"Aunt Daisy, what do you think of Uncle Wayne?\"\nDaisy raised an eyebrow, surprised by the question. \"Why are you asking about him all of a sudden?\"\nWilliam didn't answer, pressing on, \"What do you think of Uncle Wayne?\"\nDaisy thought for a moment, then said, \"The head of Infinity Unity Group, highly capable, shrewd, and efficient.\" She paused, looking at William with a half-smile, \"Why are you asking? Are you planning to take over Infinity Unity Group?\"\nWilliam hesitated, then said, \"Aunt Daisy, I suspect Uncle Wayne is connected to my parents' deaths.\"\nDaisy's eyes widened in shock, \"You suspect Wayne?\"\nWilliam pressed his lips together, not responding.\nDaisy sighed, \"Actually, there are some things I shouldn't tell you...\"\nAlvin remained silent throughout the journey, walking a short distance ahead of Victoria as they left the airport.\nVictoria felt a sense of helplessness. She knew exactly why Alvin was upset.\nAlvin rarely got angry with Victoria, especially after his release from prison. He had been trying to make up for lost time, treating her with utmost care.\nBut anything involving William seemed to hit a nerve.\n\"Dad, are you still mad at me?\" Victoria asked cautiously, her delicate face falling, showing a mix of guilt and a desire to please.\nAlvin stopped, turning to look at her, his eyes filled with guilt and affection. He interrupted her, \"It's not your fault. It's all my fault.\"\nIn the end, the root of the problem lay with him. How could Victoria be to blame?\n\"Dad, don't say that. There's really nothing between us anymore. We've completely broken up.\"\nHer voice grew softer towards the end. She really didn't want to discuss this in front of Alvin.\n\"That's good.\" Alvin felt a deep sense of guilt and didn't say more, just sighed quietly.\nBefore leaving the airport, Victoria mustered the courage to send William a message.",

        "content": "Alvin trailed behind, lugging their bags as they slowly made their way out of the airport terminal.\n\"Victoria!\" Samuel called out from the arrivals gate, holding a big bouquet of champagne roses, standing tall and confident.\nHe was dressed in a gray shirt and casual pants, with gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose. His chiseled face wore a gentle smile, giving him a refined and handsome look.\nWomen passing by couldn't help but glance over, their eyes filled with envy and jealousy, wishing they could trade places with Victoria and be the girl receiving such affection.\n\"Samuel?\" Victoria was surprised, quickly walking up to him. \"What are you doing here?\"\nSamuel stepped forward, taking over the luggage cart with a gentlemanly smile. \"Of course, I'm here to pick up my girlfriend and bring her home.\"\nHe then turned to Alvin. \"Mr. Carter, hello. I'm Samuel. Victoria has mentioned you often, and it's a pleasure to finally meet you.\"\nHe gave a slight bow, polite and humble.\nAlvin sized up Samuel, noting his well-mannered behavior, and a hint of approval flashed in his eyes. He nodded slightly. \"Hello, thank you for coming.\"\nIt was clear that Alvin had a favorable impression of Samuel, a stark contrast to his attitude towards William.\n\"Mr. Carter, this is what I should do,\" Samuel said, then looked at Victoria with a soft smile. \"You must be exhausted from the trip, right?\"\nSeeing his attentive demeanor, Victoria felt a pang of bitterness in her heart.\nAfter a brief hesitation, she reached out and linked her arm with Samuel's, resting her head lightly on his shoulder.\nTo onlookers, they appeared to be a sweet couple reunited after a long separation.\nAlvin looked on, satisfied.\nSamuel's handsome face showed a moment of surprise, quickly replaced by joy. His gaze at Victoria was so intense it seemed to melt her, and he couldn't help but smile. Leaning close, he whispered in her ear, \"Did you miss me?\"\nVictoria's cheeks flushed, and she gave him a playful glare, signaling with her eyes that Alvin was still nearby.\n\"Alright, alright, we'll talk later,\" Samuel said, his warm breath tickling her ear, making her blush even more.\nSamuel then turned to Alvin. \"Mr. Carter, I've booked a restaurant to welcome you and Victoria. Would that be convenient for you?\"\nAlvin glanced at Victoria, seeing no objection in her eyes, and agreed. \"That sounds good. Thank you.\"\nDuring the drive, Samuel drove smoothly while Victoria sat in the passenger seat, gazing out the window, her thoughts wandering.\nShe occasionally stole glances at Samuel and then at Alvin, her emotions a mix of confusion and unease.\nAt the restaurant, Samuel had arranged a private room with an elegant and quiet ambiance.\nAlvin looked around, clearly pleased.\nThe three of them sat down, and the waiter poured water and served appetizers.\nSamuel handed the menu to Alvin. \"Mr. Carter, please choose something you like.\"\nAlvin skimmed through the menu briefly and then handed it back. \"You can order. I'm not picky.\"\nSamuel smiled and turned to Victoria. \"Victoria, why don't you pick a few of your favorites?\"\nHis eyes were full of affection, making Victoria's cheeks flush slightly.\nWhile waiting for the food, Alvin asked, \"Samuel, what do you do?\"\nSamuel sat up straight and answered seriously, \"Mr. Carter, I'm a professor at the University of Aesthetics Shine. My parents are businesspeople, and their ventures are doing quite well.\"\nVictoria found Samuel's serious demeanor amusing, having never seen him so formal before.\nBut then, thinking about the reason behind his behavior and her complicated history with William, her heart sank. \nLowering her eyes to hide her emotions, she felt guilt and a bit distressed.\nNoticing this, Samuel gently took her hand under the table and asked softly, \"What's wrong? Are you tired?\"\nVictoria, holding his hand, kept her head down, avoiding his gaze. \"Yeah, a bit tired, but I'm fine.\"\nHearing this, Samuel immediately asked the waiter to hurry with the food and then comforted her. \"Hang in there. Have a little something to eat, and I'll take you home to rest soon.\"\nVictoria nodded slightly, obediently picking up some vegetables and eating slowly.\nSeeing Samuel's attentive care for Victoria, Alvin felt both relieved and a bit sad.\nHe was relieved that Victoria had found a man worthy of her, someone who seemed upright and wouldn't mistreat her, far better than William.\nHe just hoped Victoria could truly move on from William and start anew.\nBy the end of the meal, Alvin's impression of Samuel had improved even more. Despite being several years older than Victoria, Samuel was maturity, thoughtfulness, and attentiveness, which made Alvin believe that this young man might provide Victoria with a stable future.\nAfter listening to Daisy, William finally understood that Wayne's mother wasn't his grandmother.\nShe was Garth's secretary when he was young.\nAfter a party, the secretary drugged Garth, slept with him, and became pregnant with Wayne.\nShe died from severe bleeding during childbirth.\nWilliam's grandmother, being kind-hearted, took in the innocent child and raised Wayne as her own.\nBecause it involved the elders' privacy, William had never known.\nEven Daisy only found out from her mother before she passed away.\n\"Did my parents know?\" William asked, frowning, his eyes deep and unreadable.\n\"Your parents probably didn't know. Your grandmother fell ill and passed away after they died,\" Daisy replied.\nWilliam pressed his lips together, silent for a long time.\nHe couldn't imagine that his grandmother and Garth, who had been in love for most of their lives, had such a betrayal and a secret child.\nDaisy, seeing his conflicted expression, cautiously asked, \"William, why do you suspect Wayne?\"\nWilliam narrowed his eyes, his face cold and stern.\n\"I'll find out,\" he said indifferently, his deep eyes flashing with a chilling light.\n\"What are you going to do?\" Daisy pressed.\nWilliam's expression hardened. \"I have my ways.\"\n\"William,\" Daisy hesitated, then sighed and shook her head. \"Wayne isn't easy to deal with. Be careful.\"\nJust as William was about to respond, his phone rang with a special ringtone. It was a message from Victoria-she had landed.\nAt the same time, the bodyguard protecting her sent photos of Victoria and Samuel embracing at the airport.\nHis gaze darkened instantly, his grip on the phone tightening, his knuckles turning white.\nThe next moment, he threw the phone onto the table beside the hospital bed, standing up abruptly and growling in frustration, \"I'm going back.\"",

To watch her cozy up to Samuel?\"\nWilliam's brow furrowed, his face full of disdain and resistance. \"You don't get it.\"\nDaisy scoffed dismissively. \"You're just banking on the fact that she still has feelings for you. William, you need to understand something: once you hurt someone, even if you make amends, the scars remain.\"\nWilliam's lips pressed into a thin line, his gaze becoming inscrutable. \"Even if there are scars, over time, they fade.\"\nDaisy gave a sigh of resignation. \"Fine, do whatever you want. I'm done trying to talk sense into you.\"\nWilliam completed his discharge paperwork, and Harry had already booked the earliest flight.\nBefore they left, Louie had specially sent Paxton to see them off. Such treatment from the renowned Louie was a rare honor.\nDaisy couldn't help but look over, curiosity piqued. \"What did you promise him? You're not getting involved in some illegal deal, are you?\"\nWilliam gave her a helpless look, half-amused, half-exasperated. \"What are you thinking? I don't do illegal stuff. We just reached a business strategic partnership. He provides the funding, I provide the plans and manpower. After we take down The Iron Crocodiles, I'll help him rebrand his image positively, and we'll start a company together.\"\nOnce successful, Louie would no longer be an underground kingpin but a respected businessman.\nAs for William, this would expand his business empire, a win-win situation.\nSo, despite the ups and downs of this trip to Xandria, it was quite fruitful.\nThe two arrived at the airport, the waiting area bustling with people in a hurry.\nAs they walked, William suddenly stopped, his gaze fixed.\nNot far away, a familiar figure came into view-it was Alice.\nAfter dinner, Samuel drove Victoria and Alvin back to their neighborhood.\nAs soon as the car stopped, Samuel seemed to remember something and quickly said to Victoria, \"Victoria, can you help your dad with his luggage? I'll grab something from the trunk.\"\nVictoria nodded. Samuel retrieved a beautifully crafted, high-end dinnerware set from the trunk and walked over to Alvin. \"Mr. Carter, it's our first meeting, and I didn't prepare much. This is a small token of my respect. I hope you like it.\"\nAlvin initially declined but accepted it after seeing Samuel's sincerity. \"Thank you, Samuel. I appreciate it. I'll head up now.\"\nWith that, Alvin dragged his luggage towards the house.\nSamuel suddenly remembered something and grabbed Victoria's hand, looking slightly panicked. \"Victoria, does your dad know your mom is here too?\"\nVictoria froze, realizing she had completely forgotten about it.\nShe looked out the car window in a panic, only to see Alvin already inside the villa.\nSamuel looked at her, worried. \"What do we do?\"\nHe had seen Nora's temper before and knew things could get messy.\n\"Let them deal with it,\" Victoria said, feeling exhausted.\nAs she was about to head inside, Samuel suddenly pulled her close, his bright eyes reflecting only her.\nHe sighed softly and gently held her. \"Why wasn't I the one by your side these past few days? When you needed me the most, I wasn't there. I'm really not a good boyfriend, am I?\"\nVictoria felt a warmth in her heart and quickly reassured him. \"Don't say that. You couldn't control what happened. You didn't want it to be this way either.\"\nSamuel's clear eyes narrowed slightly, a bitter smile on his face. \"Just don't think I'm useless.\"\n\"Stop talking nonsense!\" Victoria playfully slapped his chest, looking very affectionate. \"If you keep saying that, I really won't talk to you anymore!\"\n\"Okay, okay, I won't say it!\" Samuel quickly coaxed her, pressing her head against his chest. \"From now on, I'll listen to you. Whatever you say goes!\"\nVictoria couldn't help but laugh.\nBeing with him always made her feel relaxed.\n\"Come in and have a drink,\" she said.\n\"Sure.\"\nHand in hand, they walked towards the neighborhood.\nAt that moment, a tall figure slowly emerged from the shadows.\nAs he passed a trash can, he paused and casually tossed a small, exquisite velvet box into it.\nVictoria and Samuel had just stepped inside when they heard Nora's sobbing.\nShe wasn't screaming like before but sat on the couch, looking frail and weak. Her sobs were suppressed and restrained, as if she had been deeply wronged.\n\"Where can I go? I have no home and I'm seriously ill,\" she choked out. \"I gave up my only chance for a kidney transplant. I don't know how long I have left. If you make me leave now, you're just sending me to my death.\"\nHer voice was filled with sorrow and a strong sense of pleading.\n\"I was wrong. I was wrong before. Please forgive me.\" She cried, tears streaming down her face, ruining her makeup. She looked pitiful and disheveled.\nVictoria stood at the staircase corner, listening to Nora's tearful pleas, feeling nothing but a sense of disgust.\nFor so many years, Nora had always put on this act for her.\nOut of mother-daughter affection, Victoria had always played along.\nBut now, she only felt annoyance.\nNora had never truly cared about her as a daughter.\nVictoria listened with a cold expression, while Samuel's face changed slightly.\nWhat did she mean by giving up her chance for a kidney transplant?\nWas that because of her kindness? Definitely not.\nBut her words were still quite impactful.\nNo matter what, she was Victoria's mother and Alvin's wife of twenty years. She was seriously ill and homeless. How could they possibly ignore her and let her fend for herself?\nAlvin sat on the couch, frowning, saying nothing.\n\"Victoria, I'll head out,\" Samuel said quietly. \"It's your family matter, and it's not appropriate for me to stay.\"\nVictoria nodded at him and turned to go inside, closing the door behind her.\nVictoria sat down next to Alvin and looked at Nora, who was supposedly her mother. But in her heart, she felt she was less important to Nora than her old pets.\n\"You and my dad are already divorced. If there's no love left, why stay and make things awkward for everyone?\" Victoria said coldly.\nNora wiped her tears and choked out, \"Victoria, I've done many things to hurt you over the years. You have every right to hate me. But I really love your dad. I don't expect you to forgive me. I just want to spend my last days with you. Victoria, I'm begging you.\"\nShe grabbed Victoria's arm, her tone earnest.\nVictoria remained unmoved. \"You love my dad? You just see that he's out of prison and can support you again, so you're clinging to him.\"",

        "content": "Nora's thoughts were spot on, and a flash of anger crossed her face.\nShe raised her voice, \"Victoria, I'm your mother! Don't you want a complete family? You haven't started your own family yet, so you don't get the pain of a broken marriage. When you get married, your husband's family will care about your background!\"\nAlvin hesitated and looked at Victoria.\nBut Victoria was completely indifferent, her tone cold, \"A family that only brings torment is better off gone.\"\n\"You!\"\n\"I just hope you two can part ways peacefully and not end up as enemies.\"\nVictoria was too calm. Alvin glanced sideways at her, searching her face for any sign of reluctance or attachment.\nAt that moment, he suddenly understood that this broken marriage had left Victoria with nothing but pain and misfortune.\nAlvin fell silent.\n\"What nonsense are you talking about?\" Nora stared at her in disbelief, then looked at Alvin expectantly, \"Alvin, say something!\"\nThey say men become more attractive and steady in middle age. Alvin had kept up his fitness routine even in prison, his body tall and strong, his features rugged, exuding the charm of a mature man.\nNora's gaze was greedy, unable to look away.\nA crazy obsession screamed in her heart: Alvin was hers, and he must remain hers!\n\"Alvin.\" Seeing him remain silent, Nora's tears began to fall again, \"We were married once. Can you really bear to see me homeless?\"\nAlvin stood up, looking tired, \"I'll take you to a hotel.\"\n\"I don't want to go to a hotel. This is my home!\" Nora refused to comply.\nAlvin turned back and gave her a deep look, his eyes full of helplessness, \"I don't want to make a scene in front of Victoria.\"\nNora bit her lip and glared viciously at Victoria.\nShe felt a bit unwilling, but then she thought the chance to be alone with Alvin was rare and not to be missed.\nAlvin had been in prison for years; who knew how long it had been since he had been with a woman?\nThinking this, her cheeks flushed slightly, and an indescribable heat surged in her heart.\nAlvin took Nora and her luggage and left.\nVictoria watched their backs for a long time before coming back to her senses. After thinking for a moment, she decided to text Daisy about what had happened today.\nShe was about to close the door and rest when the property staff came over.\n\"Ms. Carter, the cleaner found a bouquet and a jewelry box in the trash can outside your door. The card in the flowers had your name on it.\"\nThe staff handed Victoria a pink jewelry box, \"Could you check if it's yours?\"\nVictoria took the box and opened it, revealing a large pink diamond ring. The inside of the ring was engraved with \"W loves V\". There was no need to guess who had sent it.\nVictoria felt a pang in her heart, the blurry face from last night flashing in her mind. She closed her eyes.\nWhen she opened them again, she was calm. She accepted the ring and politely thanked the property staff.\nAlvin knew Nora always enjoyed luxury and had high material demands, so he arranged a deluxe suite for her. After completing the check-in, he prepared to leave.\nNora immediately grabbed his sleeve, seductively pleading, \"Walk me up, please.\"\nAlvin frowned, wanting to refuse. But she stepped closer, her voice tinged with fear, \"It's late, and I'm a bit scared.\"\nNora knew Alvin could never resist her when she showed weakness. As soon as she did, he would soften.\nAlvin checked his watch and saw it was late. After a moment of silence, he nodded slightly, \"Alright, let's go.\"\nNora's eyes lit up instantly, and she followed him like a clingy kitten.\nAfter taking Nora to her room, Alvin began to check around, looking for hidden cameras.\nNora watched his back, memories flooding her mind. He used to be so cautious every time they stayed in a hotel, checking the room thoroughly before leaving. Back then, she thought he was overly cautious and often argued with him, insisting on getting two rooms.\nNow, thinking back, she realized how unreasonable she had been. She had missed out on a man who cared so much for her. Regret filled her heart.\nHer eyes reddened, and she walked up behind him, hugging him tightly, choking out, \"Alvin, stay with me tonight, please?\"\nAlvin's first reaction was to forcefully pull her hands away, quickly putting distance between them.\n\"We're divorced,\" he said coldly, the warmth from the past long gone.\nNora couldn't accept Alvin's change in attitude, her emotions collapsing, tears streaming down her face, \"You said the divorce was to protect me. How can you be so heartless to me now?\"\nAlvin didn't want to discuss the past anymore, replying coldly, \"Remember to lock the doors and windows. I'm leaving.\"\n\"You can't leave!\" She grabbed him tightly, her emotions intense, breathing heavily, her face pale. \"We haven't finished talking. You can't leave!\"\nAlvin frowned, forcefully breaking free from her grip, and moved to open the door.\n\"Alvin!\" Nora, unwilling to give up, rushed forward, stumbling and falling into his arms, cold sweat on her forehead, her body trembling.\n\"What's wrong?\" Alvin quickly supported her.\n\"I feel terrible.\" Her face showed pain, clearly not faking it.\nWithout hesitation, Alvin picked her up and carefully placed her on the bed.\n\"Don't go!\" As he prepared to leave, Nora clung to his neck, refusing to let go despite her discomfort, using all her strength to keep him there.\n\"I'm in this state, and you still want to leave? What if something happens to me and I die here?\"\n\"Don't talk nonsense.\"\n\"Alvin, you don't know how much I've suffered these years, not just in my heart, but...\" her voice was low and muffled, \"my body misses you too.\"\nAlvin froze for a moment, his brow furrowing. Just as he was about to push her away, a mocking voice came from behind, \"Nora, it seems like none of the guys you've been with have really made you happy.\"\nBoth Alvin and Nora were startled, turning quickly to see Daisy standing at the door with her arms crossed.\nAlvin's face showed a brief flash of embarrassment, but he quickly regained his composure.\n\"Who invited you here?\" Nora snapped angrily.\n\"You looked like you were dying, so I thought I'd come check on you out of old acquaintance,\" Daisy replied slowly.\n\"Mind your own business! Get out!\"\nDaisy glanced disdainfully at the bedridden Nora, smirking, \"Still daring to order me around, huh?\"\nNora was furious, about to retort when she noticed Alvin's discomfort, and suddenly realized.\nShe grabbed Alvin's arm, pulling him close, a mocking smile on her lips, \"I see now, you're so interested in our family matters because you're after my man! Don't you know it's wrong to break up a family? Can't get married yourself, so you steal someone else's man? Have you no shame?\"",

        "content": "As soon as she spoke, not only did Daisy get angry, but Alvin's face darkened.\nDaisy glared at Nora. \"Your man? I remember you cheated on him over a decade ago and divorced him two years ago when he was down and out.\"\nDaisy paused, then looked at Alvin with a mocking smile. \"Are you two rekindling your old flame and getting remarried?\"\nNora's face changed dramatically, and she raised her voice. \"What nonsense are you spouting? My family's business is none of your concern!\"\nAs she spoke, she tightened her grip on Alvin's arm.\nAlvin frowned deeply, a hint of annoyance in his eyes. With a slight effort, he freed himself from her grasp.\n\"We're not getting remarried.\"\nThat brief sentence eased Daisy's expression a bit.\n\"Alvin!\" Nora called out softly. Though she was older, her frequent visits to beauty salons and diligent self-care had preserved her mature charm.\nDaisy snorted and rolled her eyes. \"Are we leaving or not?\" She glanced at Alvin, her tone tinged with impatience.\n\"Yes.\" Alvin responded sullenly and followed her.\n\"Alvin! Alvin!\" Nora jumped out of bed in a hurry. \"You can't leave. I'm still feeling unwell. What if something happens to me after you go?\"\nAlvin's steps faltered slightly.\nDaisy's narrow eyes squinted as she turned back and yanked him out, muttering, \"What are you worried about? During the years you were in prison, she lived quite comfortably without you! But Victoria had to work day and night to support her and her lover's son while they were living the high life!\"\nVictoria was Alvin's bottom line. The hardships she endured over the years had left deep, unhealed scars in Alvin's heart.\n\"You vile woman, stop talking nonsense!\" Nora lunged forward, trying to explain, but Alvin turned and walked away without even sparing her a glance.\n\"Alvin!\" Nora called out again.\nDaisy stepped in front of her, her gaze darkening as she approached, lowering her voice with a menacing edge. \"You're right. I do have ulterior motives. This man will be mine sooner or later, so you better give up now!\"\n\"You bitch!\" Nora raised her hand, ready to slap Daisy.\nDaisy quickly caught her wrist, pushed her back, and slammed the door shut.\nShe straightened her clothes, turned around gracefully, and felt a wave of satisfaction.\nBut when she looked up, she saw Alvin standing at the end of the hallway.\nDaisy pouted, slowly walked over in her high heels, and mumbled pitifully, \"My feet hurt.\"\nAlvin glanced at her indifferently, said nothing, and started walking away.\nDaisy made a face behind his back, grumbling to herself, 'So heartless!'\nAs soon as the elevator doors opened, she stumbled and nearly twisted her ankle, hobbling out awkwardly.\nDaisy was genuinely annoyed now. She had only pretended her foot pain, but it turned out to be true. \nShe cursed Alvin under her breath, but when she looked up, she saw him waiting outside the elevator with a pair of fluffy slippers in his hand.\nWithout a word, he knelt down, held her ankle, swiftly removed her high heels, and put the slippers on her.\nDaisy looked down at him, a small smile forming on her lips.\n\"Let's go.\" Alvin stood up and walked ahead.\nDaisy felt much lighter on her feet, quickly catching up and linking her arm with his.\nAlvin's body stiffened, and he tried to pull his arm back, but she held on tightly.\n\"Nora can hold you, but I can't? Are you still thinking about her?\"\nBefore he could respond, Daisy fired off a rapid series of questions. \"Alvin, are you blind? You have a beautiful, wealthy woman like me right here, and you still want your ex-wife? I'm telling you, if you dare remarry her, I'll turn your life upside down. Believe it or not?\"\nAlvin opened his mouth, glanced at her, then slowly pressed his lips together, his eyes full of helplessness.\nOnce they were out of the hotel, he finally spoke softly. \"I won't remarry her.\"\nDaisy was momentarily stunned, then broke into a wide smile, leaning closer to him. \"What did you say? The wind's too strong, I didn't hear you.\"\nTo Alvin, she seemed like a mischievous little girl.\nHe extended a finger and gently poked her forehead. \"Get in the car.\"\nAlvin got in first, and Daisy stood there, covering her mouth with a smile.\nOnce inside, Daisy sent a message to Victoria: [Got him!]\nVictoria replied instantly with a thumbs-up emoji.\nSomehow, Alvin caught a glimpse of their conversation.\nHe raised an eyebrow slightly. \"Victoria?\"\nDaisy didn't hide it, chatting with Victoria while asking, \"What do you think Victoria should call me in the future? Ms. Scott sounds too formal, but calling me Mom feels awkward.\"\nAlvin pretended not to hear, focusing on driving.\nAt a red light, Daisy suddenly reached over, hooked her arm around his neck, pulled him close, and kissed his cheek, snapping several photos in quick succession.\nAlvin frowned, about to ask, \"You...\"\nDaisy looked down, busy editing the photos on her phone. \"I finally got you, of course I have to announce it to the world!\"\nAlvin sighed helplessly. Just then, the light turned green, and he restarted the car and drove off.\nVictoria sat at her desk, studying. An open book lay in front of her, with a ring quietly resting beside it.\nShe hesitated, wondering if she should ask William about it. But what if the ring wasn't from him?\nWouldn't that be awkward?\nAs she wrestled with her thoughts, Wendy called.\n\"Victoria! Check the news, your mom tried to kill herself at a hotel.\"\nVictoria froze, then hurriedly clicked the link Wendy sent. It was a video taken by a hotel guest.\nIn the footage, Nora was being carried into an ambulance, with onlookers whispering that her husband had a mistress who flaunted it on social media, driving her to take an overdose of sleeping pills. She had called the hotel in a daze, and soon she was noticed and received prompt medical attention.\nAlmost simultaneously, Samuel called, his voice urgent. \"Wait for me, I'll take you to the hospital!\"",

        "content": "At the hospital\nReporters swarmed the entrance, making it almost impossible to get through. Police officers were doing their best to disperse the crowd.\nSamuel held Victoria close, placing a hat on her head before they managed to squeeze inside and hurriedly make their way to the elevator.\nNora had been taken out of danger and moved to a hospital room, but she was still extremely agitated and crying uncontrollably.\nAlvin sat across from her, head down, silent.\nWhen Victoria arrived, she saw Daisy sitting alone outside the room.\n\"Ms. Scott?\"\n\"I think I might have pushed her too far,\" Daisy said, looking a bit despondent. \"I didn't want Alvin to have anything to do with her, so I posted a picture of us together. I never thought she'd gamble with her life over it.\"\nShe had asked the doctor, and the amount of sleeping pills Nora had taken was no joke. If they had been a few minutes later, she wouldn't have made it.\nNora had really risked her life, forcing Daisy to either back off or face her death.\nAt that moment, Daisy felt an overwhelming sense of exhaustion.\nFighting over a man with a woman like this, even if she came out on top, she would still be haunted by the emotional damage.\n\"You should go in first.\" Daisy needed time to sort out her thoughts.\nVictoria wanted to comfort her but didn't know where to start. She nodded silently and entered the room with Samuel.\n\"I know you want to get rid of me. Now that you're out of prison and your career is picking up, you must think I'm old and sick, a burden. Daisy is younger and richer than me. I understand why you'd choose her. That's why I decided to let you go. If I die, you and Victoria will be free. After all, you both hate me.\"\nNora cried, covering her face with her hands, sobbing uncontrollably.\nHearing the door open, Alvin looked up at Victoria. Then he glanced at Daisy sitting outside before looking away.\nVictoria walked in and saw Nora crying her heart out. She frowned slightly.\nSamuel whispered in her ear, \"I'll wait for you in the parking lot.\"\nVictoria nodded.\nSamuel greeted Alvin before thoughtfully leaving the room and closing the door quietly.\nNora cried even harder when she saw Victoria. \"Victoria! Remember, I'm your real mother! How could you side with outsiders against me? You just want to drive me to my death so no one will need your kidney. I didn't realize how cruel you could be at such a young age!\"\nShe struggled to get up, becoming more agitated. \"Fine, I'll die! I'll make it easy for you all!\"\nAlvin quickly stood up and held her down, his voice low and stern. \"Our issues have nothing to do with Victoria.\"\n\"Alvin, I can't live without you. If you leave me, what's the point of living? If you fall for someone else, it's like stabbing me with a knife! I'd rather die than see you with another woman. I don't want to live anymore.\"\nShe cried and flailed, her nails scratching Alvin's arms, leaving red marks.\nVictoria, feeling sorry for Alvin, was about to help when Nora suddenly pushed her away, screaming hysterically, \"Get away! You're not my daughter! I don't have a daughter who sides with her father's mistress! Victoria, you'll get your karma!\"\nThough Nora was weak from her suicide attempt, she pushed with surprising strength. Victoria stumbled into the corner, her head buzzing.\nAt that moment, the door burst open.\nA pair of strong hands quickly helped her up.\nVictoria steadied herself and turned to see William's deep, cold eyes.\nShe was shocked, never expecting him to be here.\nHis familiar presence inexplicably calmed her.\nAlvin also saw him, his expression darkening, especially seeing how close William was to Victoria. He frowned deeply.\nWilliam's cold gaze swept over Nora.\nHe didn't even glance at Alvin, his eyes fixed on Nora with a hint of a smirk and a mocking tone. \"Nora, let's talk.\"\nNora, fearing him, visibly calmed down the moment he entered the room.\nEvery time she saw William, she instinctively covered her neck, as if it still ached, her chest tightening.\nShe resisted, \"I have nothing to talk about with you! Whatever you and Victoria do is your business. I don't care.\"\nHearing this, Alvin's face darkened further, and he pulled his hand away from her grip.\nVictoria's cheeks flushed slightly.\nWilliam, however, chuckled and tossed a lawsuit onto the table.\n\"You bribed the media to spread rumors about my aunt being a mistress and staged a suicide drama to manipulate public opinion. Nora, it looks like you want to join Bobby.\"\nVictoria was stunned, looking at Nora in disbelief. \"Mom, did you do this?\"\nWilliam raised an eyebrow. \"Who else could it be?\"\n\"I didn't!\" Nora vehemently denied it, glaring at William with gritted teeth. \"I know the Scott family has power and influence. It's easy for you to crush someone like me! But I'm telling you, I didn't do it! You just want to take revenge on me because of Victoria! If you have issues with her, deal with her, not me!\"\nShe didn't hesitate to shift the blame onto Victoria.\nVictoria's expression changed, and she slowly looked at Nora.\nShe knew Nora was stubborn and foolish, but she didn't expect her to still try to shift the blame at this point.\nAlvin's face grew darker, frowning. \"Why drag Victoria into this? It has nothing to do with her!\"\n\"Do you think I'm stupid?\" Nora glared at Victoria, her eyes red and swollen. \"If she hadn't tipped off Daisy, how would she know we were at the hotel? She just sees Daisy as richer and William's aunt, so she sold me out to please William.\"\n\"Shut up!\" William snapped. \"Who do you think you are, daring to insult her in front of me?\"\nVictoria looked at him and softly called, \"William.\"\n\"Don't speak!\" William remained firm, not backing down even in front of Alvin when it came to defending Victoria.\nVictoria hesitated, then instinctively closed her mouth.\nBut she quickly realized it was inappropriate and glanced at Alvin.\nAlvin frowned, staring at William, his voice cold. \"She's my daughter. Who gave you the right to talk to her like that?\"\nVictoria felt caught in the middle as the two men faced off again.",

When she was bullied and burned, where were you? When she was falsely accused and insulted, where were you?\"\nAlvin's face changed slightly, a flash of pain and guilt in his eyes.\nVictoria, feeling sorry for Alvin, didn't want him to be questioned like this. She pleaded softly, \"William, stop.\"\nBut William ignored her, his gaze growing colder and his tone sharper. \"Nora and Bobby treat her like a servant, take her money, and even try to take her kidney. She's suffered so much, and now you still stand by and watch Nora pick on her. Have you fulfilled your duty as a father?\"\nWilliam pulled Victoria in front of him, holding her hand tightly in front of Alvin.\n\"I admit, I've been harsh to her these past two years and have done many things to hurt her. But I've always protected her! For her, I'd give up my life!\"\nAlvin's fists clenched tightly, his knuckles turning white.\n\"William, that's enough! Stop talking!\" Victoria couldn't hold back anymore. She pushed his hand away and hurried to Alvin, anxiously saying, \"Dad, don't listen to him. I'm really fine. I'm doing well.\"\nWilliam's face darkened, glaring at Victoria.\nThis ungrateful woman!\nAlvin shook his head slowly, his voice full of disappointment and defeat. \"No, it's me who didn't protect you.\"\nNora finally understood that William was standing up for Victoria!\nShe couldn't admit to any of this and immediately retorted, \"Stop making things up.\"\nWilliam, already fuming from Victoria's earlier actions, turned his head and gave Nora a cold, sidelong glance, sneering. \"Save it for my lawyer.\"\nHis intention was clear: he wanted to send Nora to jail!\nEver since Nora had coveted Victoria's kidney, William had this idea. Someone like her didn't deserve to be around Victoria!\nNora's face turned pale instantly. She knew William's methods; he was ruthless when he wanted to be!\nShe didn't dare openly resist and could only cry and plead with Alvin for help.\nBut Alvin, tormented by William's earlier questioning, was too focused on how to make it up to Victoria to pay any attention to Nora.\nNo matter how much Nora cried and hinted, he remained unmoved.\nAt this moment, the hospital staff arrived.\nWithout a word, Alvin grabbed Victoria and prepared to leave.\n\"No! Alvin, you can't go! I need you!\"\nAlvin didn't respond, pushing the door open and leaving.\nVictoria finally breathed a sigh of relief.\nAs she stepped out, she saw Samuel. Daisy was talking to him about something, and he was looking down, his handsome face unreadable.\nVictoria didn't have time to say anything to him. She turned back to William. \"Come with me.\"\nHer tone wasn't exactly gentle.\nAlvin glanced at Victoria, wanting to stop her, but seeing the determination in her eyes, he slowly lowered his hand.\nWilliam's lips curled into a faint smile, raising an eyebrow as he casually slipped his hands into his pockets. He glanced at Samuel before following her unhurriedly.\nSamuel looked up, his gaze fixed on the two of them until they disappeared around the corner.\nOn a small platform at the end of the hallway, Victoria stopped and turned to stare directly at William. \"Are you really going to sue her?\"\nWilliam seemed quite pleased, leaning against the wall and looking at her with a tilted head. \"What, you want to plead for her?\"\nVictoria frowned, her tone tinged with helplessness. \"I don't want to drag my dad into this.\"\nAlvin again!\nWilliam snorted disdainfully. \"Do you really need to worry so much about him?\"\nNo matter what he said, Victoria kept her eyes on him, continuing to press. \"You have a way, don't you?\"\nHer words amused William. He raised an eyebrow and asked, \"Why do you think I'd help him?\"\nVictoria was silent for a moment, reluctantly taking a small step forward, \"You will help, right?\"\nWilliam glared at her, annoyed. \"No!\"\nHis previously good mood was instantly ruined by her words; his handsome face turned icy, as if covered in frost.\nVictoria grew anxious, her words spilling out rapidly. \"This also involves your aunt. If you really didn't care, why did you come all this way tonight?\"\nWilliam took a deep breath and suddenly laughed, stepping closer with a powerful presence. \"How do you know I came for Aunt Daisy?\"\n\"If not for her, then who? It can't be for me, right?\"\nVictoria laughed at herself, but looking at his face, she couldn't muster a smile.\nShe stared at him, biting her lower lip, and asked softly, \"Did you really come for me?\"\nWilliam gritted his teeth. \"No. Why would I come for you? Why would I come all this way for a heartless woman like you?\"\nWilliam was genuinely angry now.\nHe placed his hands on his hips, the angrier he got, the more his smile seemed eerie.\n\"How could I forget? You have a boyfriend now. Why would you need to ask me for such a small thing? Just go to your boyfriend!\"\nVictoria's face turned sour. She lifted her shimmering eyes, responding stiffly, \"You don't need to mock me. If you don't want to help, fine. Just pretend I never asked!\"\nShe turned to leave.\nWilliam frowned, grabbing her arm. \"Is this how you ask for help?\"\n\"I was polite enough! What more do you want?\" She angrily shook off his hand. \"You said my mom picked on me, but I think the one who picked on me the most is you! It was like this before, and it's still like this now!\"\nWilliam laughed.\nHe raised his hand, pointing a finger at her chest.\nVictoria instinctively raised her arm to protect herself, her face full of vigilance. \"What are you doing?\"\nHe narrowed his eyes, a wicked smile on his lips. \"I'm telling you, I want to pick on you right now!\"\n\"You-\"\nBefore she could finish, he suddenly lowered his head, capturing her soft, moist lips, forcefully prying open her teeth and invading her mouth.",

She was held tightly in his arms.\nAfter a long while, he finally let her go. Looking at the breathless Victoria in his arms, he curved his thin lips into a smile. \"Victoria, you can't escape.\"\nWith that, he ignored her angry expression and turned to leave the hospital.\nVictoria stood there, staring blankly at William's retreating figure, unable to snap out of it for a long time.\nShe suddenly remembered all the things he had done to her in the past.\nThe hurt and humiliation, the protection and indulgence, all intertwined into a dense web that enveloped her completely, leaving her nowhere to hide.\nAfter a while, she took out a small mirror from her bag, tidied up her appearance, and, after confirming there was nothing amiss, turned to leave.\nIn the hallway, Samuel asked softly, \"Finished talking?\" \n\"Yeah.\" Victoria's expression was calm, with no intention of hiding anything. \"He wants to sue my mom for Ms. Scott.\"\nSamuel was taken aback and instinctively asked, \"You're not against it?\"\nVictoria was silent for a moment before speaking softly, \"My mom is the kind of person who will stop at nothing to achieve her goals, regardless of the consequences. If she really hurt Ms. Scott, I have no right to oppose William's actions.\"\nSamuel gazed at her quietly, then gently put his arm around her shoulder.\nVictoria suddenly remembered something and looked up at him. \"What were you talking about with Ms. Scott earlier?\"\n\"Just some casual conversation,\" Samuel thought for a moment and added, \"More like an elder showing concern for a younger person.\"\nJust a moment ago, Daisy had told him that once William set his sights on someone, his possessiveness would be unimaginably strong, and no one could predict what he might do.\nSamuel didn't comment on this, just smiled.\nWhatever William wanted to do, he was welcome to try.\nThe more William did, the more he would push Victoria towards him.\nWilliam was very efficient.\nIn just one night, all news reports about Nora's suicide were taken down.\nEven the search terms were gone, and the media received a strict gag order. Anyone who wanted to stay in the industry had to keep their mouths shut.\nThis was the power of capital-arrogant and domineering, yet leaving people helpless.\nAlthough there were still some sporadic discussions online, it wouldn't be long before they were replaced by other hot news.\nVictoria went to Samuel's studio as usual to pick up the monthly paintings, thinking that she might be able to have lunch with Samuel afterward.\nIn the studio, Ryan was working on his laptop. When he saw Victoria come in, he was slightly taken aback, a hint of hesitation flashing across his face.\n\"Victoria, you're here.\" Ryan stood up, greeting her somewhat awkwardly.\n\"Yeah, I'm here to pick up this month's paintings.\" Victoria responded with a smile, her eyes searching the studio for Samuel. \"Where's Samuel?\"\n\"He has a public lecture at the university today.\"\n\"Alright.\" Victoria sighed in disappointment. \"I'll just take the paintings and go then.\"\n\"Wait a minute!\" Ryan called out to her. \"Victoria.\"\nVictoria stopped and turned to look at him.\nThey stared at each other.\nRyan pressed his lips together, not saying anything.\nVictoria, sensing something was off, raised an eyebrow in confusion. \"What's wrong with you? You seem weird.\"\nRyan hesitated for a long time before finally speaking. \"Victoria, I need to tell you something, but don't get mad.\"\n\"What is it? Why so serious?\" Victoria looked calm, with no sign of panic in her eyes.\n\"I just found out that Samuel's dad is setting him up on a blind date tonight,\" Ryan blurted out, his eyes fixed on Victoria.\nVictoria paused for a moment, then her expression returned to normal. \"I see.\"\nRyan was surprised. He had expected Victoria to be furious and question him.\nBut her extraordinary calmness left him at a loss. \"You're not mad?\"\n\"Mad? Why would I be mad?\" Victoria asked lightly.\nShe shrugged and continued, \"It might just be a well-meaning gesture from his parents. Nothing to make a fuss about.\"\nAside from that initial moment of surprise, Victoria remained exceptionally composed, genuinely seeming to trust Samuel from the bottom of her heart.\nRyan frowned in suspicion. \"This doesn't seem right!\"\nVictoria looked puzzled. \"What's not right? Trusting each other in a relationship is the most basic requirement, isn't it?\"\n\"That depends on the situation! You're way too calm. This isn't how someone should react when they hear their boyfriend is going on a blind date. Can anyone be this rational in a relationship?\" Ryan stared at her in confusion. \"Victoria, do you really not care at all about Samuel going on a blind date?\"\n\"I don't care. He's probably just humoring his dad. Nothing to worry about.\"\n\"Have you considered that the blind date was arranged by Samuel's dad? It might mean he doesn't approve of you as Samuel's girlfriend.\"\nVictoria hadn't thought about it that way. She frowned slightly and said slowly, \"Why does it have to be so complicated?\"\n\"Of course it is! Dating might be between two people, but marriage involves two families. Many couples end up divorcing because of conflicts with their in-laws. Samuel really loves you, and I hope you two can make it. You need to handle these issues properly.\"\nVictoria hadn't thought that far ahead. She looked at Ryan in shock. \"Wow, Ryan, you, a single guy, can think so far ahead and so much!\"\nRyan glared at her. \"I don't usually think this much, but Samuel is my good friend, so I worry more.\"\nVictoria laughed. \"You're really a good friend to him!\"\n\"But are you just going to wait? Wait for him to come clean with you?\"\nVictoria shook her head with a smile. \"It's fine if he doesn't. Everyone's entitled to some secrets.\"\nRyan's expression changed slightly, and he cautiously asked, \"What if it were William? If you knew he was going on a blind date, would you be just as indifferent?\"\nVictoria was about to say \"I wouldn't,\" but the words got stuck in her throat.\nA strange feeling of suffocation rose in her chest, as if something was lodged in her throat, unable to go up or down.\nShe didn't need to say anything; her reaction said it all.\nRyan pressed his lips together, deliberated for a moment, and then spoke softly. \"Victoria, your current boyfriend is Samuel. You need to step into your role as his girlfriend.\"\nAs a friend, Ryan was very considerate and usually wouldn't bring up such personal matters.\nHe must have been really concerned to speak up for Samuel.\nVictoria opened her mouth, but the words she wanted to say were swallowed back. In the end, she just smiled gently and said softly, \"I understand.\"\nSeeing that she had listened, Ryan was silent for a moment before continuing. \"There's one more thing. Samuel didn't want me to tell you, fearing you'd get angry. But I think you should know the truth.\"\nHe paused, as if making a decision, and then said, \"When your dad had an accident in Xandria, Samuel found out and immediately took leave from school, bought a ticket for the earliest flight, and went to find you. But...\"\nVictoria's expression turned serious. \"But what?\"\n\"But someone reported him for laundering money through high-priced paintings.\"",

If his parents hadn't stepped in and if he wasn't innocent, who knows what would've happened,\" Ryan said, taking a deep breath.\n\"His parents only asked him to agree to go on a date with the person they set him up with, or else they'd bring the matter to your attention,\" he added.\nVictoria stood there, stunned, unable to speak.\nSeeing her reaction, Ryan tried to comfort her. \"Even if I didn't tell you, you probably could've guessed who was behind this. Samuel didn't want me to tell you, so just act like you don't know.\"\n\"I get it. Thanks, Ryan,\" Victoria said, forcing a bitter smile.\nShe understood Ryan's intentions, but the more she did, the more guilt and self-blame she felt towards Samuel.\nRyan looked at her, hesitating to say more.\nAs the workday was winding down, the light in the gallery softened. Victoria and Wendy were still busy wrapping things up.\nJust then, Diana walked in, dressed simply yet elegantly, her face beautiful and features delicate.\nSeeing the two still working, she smiled lightly. \"All done? Dinner's on me tonight.\"\nJoshua's artwork had been a hit with buyers, earning the gallery a good profit. Diana was in a great mood and wanted to treat Victoria.\n\"This restaurant's food is amazing!\" Diana said with a slight smile. \"I often come here for business meetings and to entertain artist friends. The reputation is impeccable.\"\nWendy, curious, her eyes sparkling, said, \"You run this gallery so effortlessly, with such a wide network and always discovering great food.\"\nDiana glanced at her, a faint smile on her lips. \"Running a business is all about creating the right atmosphere and building relationships. For the gallery to thrive, you need to maintain good relations with everyone. Over time, business becomes easier.\"\nThe three of them sat down and were about to order when a group of people walked in.\nWilliam and Alice were at the back.\nAs soon as he entered, William's eyes immediately scanned the room and landed on Victoria, who was sitting in a corner.\nAlice noticed too and asked considerately, \"Do you want to go say hi?\"\nHer demeanor was gracious and understanding.\n\"No need,\" William replied, looking away as if he hadn't seen her.\nEugene, who had come along, sat next to William and quietly probed, \"Having a fight?\"\nHe was, of course, referring to William and Victoria.\nWilliam took a sip of his tea, not responding.\n\"That's odd. When you guys came back from Xandria, it seemed like there was hope for you two. Guess I was wrong,\" Eugene said, half-joking, with a hint of schadenfreude.\nIf he had to choose between Victoria and Alice, he would lean towards Alice. They had grown up together, and the bond was deep. Victoria seemed like an unexpected intruder.\nPlus, with all the complicated issues involving Alvin and the Scott family, the road ahead for those two was bound to be bumpy.\nEugene glanced at Alice, who was chatting and laughing with the investors, and said, \"Compared to Victoria, I think Alice suits you better. Look at her, despite everything, she still cares for you and helps you out. She used her connections to help you with X-STAR Solutions Inc. Without her, your new project wouldn't have progressed so smoothly. She supports you in both life and career. She's your best partner.\"\nHe glanced at Victoria and shook his head. \"She can't compare to Alice. Besides, I heard she has a boyfriend now. Don't dwell on it too much. Appreciate the one in front of you.\"\nIf William didn't know Eugene's playful nature, he might have thought he was bribed.\nAfter a long silence, William spoke slowly, \"Maybe without her, I would marry Alice, but it would never be the same.\"\nEugene understood the depth of his words.\nMarrying out of gratitude and marrying out of love are two different things.\nHe might marry Alice, but the feelings of love and attachment had never been there for her.\nThere could be responsibility and care, but that wasn't love.\nAcross the room, Wendy noticed William too and was surprised to see him here.\nShe quickly looked at Victoria.\n\"Stop staring and eat,\" Victoria said quietly, continuing to enjoy her meal as if William was just a stranger.\nEugene and the others were having a lively conversation. Alice, no longer the aloof and noble figure she once was, was enthusiastically toasting the investors.\nThough it wasn't a formal business meeting, just a private dinner, she was doing everything to support William.\nWhen Jerald McClellan, the head of the investors, suggested a drink with William, Alice quickly raised her glass, smiling, \"Mr. McClellan, I'll drink on his behalf. You see, he recently got injured in Xandria and should be resting, but he came here to meet you.\"\nJerald's impression of William improved significantly.\n\"To be honest, I've heard a lot about Mr. Scott in Harborview City,\" Jerald said, his words carefully chosen, but William knew they were likely negative rumors.\nHe had been developing in Silvermist City for the past two years, not Harborview City, but the rumors had spread widely. Now, he knew who was behind them.\nWilliam sincerely said, \"Mr. McClellan, I'm looking forward to working with X-STAR Solutions Inc.\"\nAlice raised her glass again, smiling, \"Mr. McClellan, another toast to you on William's behalf.\"\n\"Ms. Garcia, you are truly devoted to Mr. Scott. It's admirable! Mr. Scott, you should cherish Ms. Garcia,\" Jerald said.\nWilliam glanced at Alice, her cheeks flushed. She had already had quite a bit to drink at lunch and was now just holding on.\nJerald loved to drink, and to discuss business with him, one had to drink a lot. Alice knew this and was drinking for William.\nSeeing her determination, even Eugene was moved and wanted to help, but she politely declined.\n\"Mr. McClellan and I are enjoying our drinks. Don't interrupt.\"\nJerald laughed heartily, \"That's right, it's rare to find such a spirited drinking partner!\"\nWilliam frowned, placing his hand over hers as she reached for another glass. \"That's enough. Stop drinking.\"\n\"Don't worry about it,\" she whispered, pouring another glass and toasting Jerald.\nIn no time, the bottle of red wine was empty.\nIf Jerald's secretary hadn't come to remind him about his flight, they might have continued drinking.\nWilliam and Alice escorted Jerald out, who said cheerfully, \"Send the contract over tomorrow.\"\nAs soon as Jerald left, Alice lost all her strength, her body leaning softly against William.\nFeeling him support her, she struggled slightly, her voice slurred, \"I'm fine, just a bit dizzy. I'll be okay after some water. Let go, Ms. Carter is watching. Don't let her misunderstand. I can walk on my own.\"",

Her delicate and vulnerable appearance would evoke sympathy from anyone.\nVictoria glanced at them briefly before looking away, uninterested.\nWendy whispered, \"Looks like they're rekindling their old flame.\"\nAt first glance, it did seem that way.\nBut Victoria didn't care much. Whether they got back together or not, what did it matter to her? She wasn't William's girlfriend.\nDuring the meal, Victoria got up to use the restroom.\nWhen she came out, she saw Alice leaning against the sink, mumbling about feeling unwell.\nWilliam gently held her, letting her rest against his chest, soothing her softly, \"I'll take you to the hospital for an IV soon.\"\n\"No, I hate hospitals. I never want to go there again.\"\n\"It's just an IV, it won't hurt.\"\n\"I'm scared.\"\nVictoria pursed her lips, initially intending to walk past them as if she hadn't seen anything. But that felt too deliberate, making her seem guilty.\nShe took a deep breath, walked over casually, and turned on the faucet to wash her hands.\nAs she looked up, her eyes met William's in the mirror.\nShe paused briefly, then quickly composed herself and asked calmly, \"It seems Ms. Garcia had too much to drink. Do you need help?\"\nWilliam stared at her deeply for a moment, about to speak, when Samuel suddenly appeared.\n\"Victoria!\"\nVictoria looked surprised, \"Samuel? What are you doing here?\"\n\"I'm having dinner with friends upstairs. I ran into Wendy and the others on my way down.\"\nAs he approached, he noticed William and then Alice in his arms. His eyes flickered slightly, and he smiled, \"What a coincidence, Mr. Scott. Ms. Garcia had too much to drink? Need a hand?\"\n\"No need.\" William's expression remained cold and aloof, as always. He didn't even spare another glance, just held Alice's shoulder and asked softly, \"Can you walk?\"\nAlice looked up at him with misty eyes, shaking her head pitifully, \"My legs are weak, I can't stand.\"\nHe nodded slightly, then without another word, scooped her up and strode away.\nVictoria lowered her gaze, grabbed a paper towel to dry her hands, and said softly, \"Let's go too.\"\nSamuel followed her, hesitatingly asking, \"Why are you here today?\"\nVictoria stopped, \"Our boss is treating us.\"\nSamuel nodded, seeming relieved, but there was a hint of disappointment.\nVictoria found his behavior odd and turned to look at him, \"Samuel, is something bothering you today?\"\nSamuel was taken aback.\nHe shook his head slowly, \"What could be bothering me?\"\nHe turned and left quickly, as if eager to escape something.\nVictoria was even more puzzled.\nAs Samuel left the restaurant, someone called out to him.\n\"Samuel.\"\nHe turned around to see a long-haired girl in a black coat, her straight hair cascading over her shoulders, smiling brightly at him, \"We agreed, next time it's my treat.\"\nSamuel was momentarily stunned, instinctively glancing towards the parking lot, then quickly said, \"Ms. Wright, you're too kind.\"\n\"Thanks for treating me today. Next time, I'll take you to a movie, okay?\" Hannah Wright's cheeks flushed slightly, a bit shy.\nSamuel responded casually, saying, \"My friends are waiting for me,\" and hurried away.\nEaster was coming up, and Starry Studio Gallery was gearing up for a big Easter-themed exhibition. Diana asked Victoria and Wendy to pick up some flowers and decorations.\nVictoria had gotten her driver's license while working as William's secretary, and under his guidance, her driving skills were pretty solid.\nThe car she drove was a second-hand one Alvin had found. It looked ordinary but was spacious enough for daily use.\n\"Victoria, let me drive.\" Wendy had just gotten her license and was eager to get behind the wheel.\n\"Sure, you drive.\" Victoria, always indulgent towards her, handed over the keys without hesitation and settled into the passenger seat.\nWendy was thrilled, gripping the steering wheel tightly, her eyes wide open, staring straight ahead, nervous sweat forming on her forehead.\nVictoria sat beside her, occasionally reminding her softly, \"Turn signal on, turn slowly.\"\nSeeing a Rolls-Royce merging ahead, Victoria's heart tightened, quickly advising, \"That's a luxury car ahead, keep your distance.\"\nBefore she finished speaking, there was a loud crash as their car collided with the Rolls-Royce.\nWendy was silent.\nVictoria's mind went blank for a moment. Hearing Wendy's tearful voice brought her back to reality.\n\"Victoria.\"\nWendy was completely stunned, her voice trembling, \"Did I just rear-end a Rolls-Royce?\"\nWendy's family was well-off, but her mother was very strict, giving her little pocket money.\nIf she asked for money, her mother would likely exaggerate the situation to her father.\nWendy didn't want to be used as a pawn in their power struggle.\nVictoria quickly calmed down, speaking gently, \"Don't worry, I'll go check.\"\nWhen she handed the keys to Wendy, Victoria had mentally prepared herself for minor accidents. But rear-ending a luxury car was beyond her expectations.\nVictoria got out of the car, just as someone stepped out of the Rolls-Royce.\nFortunately, the accident didn't happen in a busy area, so there was no traffic jam.\n\"Sorry, it's our fault. My friend just got her license.\"\n\"Victoria?\"\nVictoria looked up, \"Harry?\"\nShe hadn't expected to see a familiar face. Just as she felt relieved, her heart sank again, wondering if the car belonged to William.\nSure enough, William stepped out of the car.\nVictoria was speechless.\nSeeing it was someone they knew, Wendy quickly got out, \"Mr. Scott, I'm sorry, it's all my fault.\"\nWilliam's deep eyes briefly rested on Victoria before looking away coldly.\nVictoria's hand tightened in her sleeve, but she maintained a distant demeanor, matching his coldness.\n\"Was it you driving?\" He directed the question at Wendy.\n\"Yes.\" Wendy looked down, embarrassed, \"How much will the repairs cost? I'll pay, but can I do it in installments?\"\nVictoria wouldn't let her pay, immediately saying, \"No need to pay, we have insurance.\"\nWilliam glanced at his car, saying indifferently, \"The insurance won't cover all my losses. The extra amount could buy you a new car.\"\nVictoria frowned, seeing Wendy's pale face, silently blaming William for scaring her.\nShe didn't believe he would be so serious about this.\nBut since they hit his car, paying for the damages was only right. She said, \"Whatever the cost, I'll pay.\"\nVictoria looked at Harry, \"You have my number. Let me know the repair cost.\"\nHarry didn't dare respond, glancing at William.\nVictoria turned to Wendy, \"Let's go.\"\nAs they got back in the car, before Victoria could close the door, it was pulled open again.\n\"Get out.\" William grabbed her arm, pulling her out of the car.",

        "content": "\"William! What the heck are you doing?\"\nWilliam shoved Victoria into his Rolls-Royce without a second thought. \n\"Take her home,\" he commanded, indicating Wendy with a glance.\nHarry caught on immediately. Just as Wendy was about to step in, he quickly nudged her back into the car. \"Come on, come on, what's going on? Let me help.\"\nThe car door closed with a sharp click, followed by the sound of the lock engaging.\n\"William!\" Victoria sat in the passenger seat, her cheeks puffed up in anger, glaring at him with wide eyes. \"Are you out of your mind?\"\nWilliam started the car smoothly, making a sharp U-turn, a mocking smile playing on his lips. \"Didn't you say you wanted to pay for the car repairs? How can we do that without an estimate?\"\n\"I told you, Harry can tell me.\"\n\"Victoria, this isn't a small amount. We're talking about repair costs that could easily run into hundreds of thousands of dollars. Why do you think I can easily trust you?\"\nVictoria was momentarily speechless.\nShe had indeed relied on their past relationship, and now that he had ruthlessly exposed her, her face burned with embarrassment. She forced herself to say, \"Fine, let's get the estimate first. I'll pay whatever it costs.\"\nWilliam's eyes narrowed slightly, the mockery in them growing more intense. \"I know you have a good salary, and your dad's business is picking up. Of course, you wouldn't think twice about this kind of money.\"\n\"William, if you have something to say, just say it. Why do you have to be so sarcastic? Who could have predicted this bad luck, rear-ending your car of all things? Don't make it sound like we did it on purpose!\"\nWilliam briefly glanced at her, his tone indifferent. \"You're so self-righteous, I almost forgot you rear-ended me.\"\nVictoria glared at him fiercely, turning her head away in a huff, refusing to engage further.\nHe really drove to the Car Service Center.\nSince they were handling it privately and she was taking full responsibility, there was no need to involve the traffic authorities. Coming here to get a rough estimate of the repair costs made sense.\nWilliam leisurely sat in the VIP lounge, sipping the coffee the manager personally brought him, watching Victoria bustle around with a calm demeanor.\nWhen Victoria received the estimate showing $250,000, she felt a wave of dizziness. She pinched herself, trying to stay composed.\nHer insurance would cover up to $150,000, leaving her to pay the remaining $100,000 out of pocket.\nThis meant she suddenly owed William $100,000.\n\"William? What are you doing here?\"\nAlice walked in, her gaze casually sweeping over Victoria before giving her a polite smile. \"You two aren't here on a date, are you? That's a new one, coming to a Car Service Center for a date. Is the food here that good?\"\nVictoria, filled with anxiety, had no time for Alice's possibly genuine or joking comment. Her eyes were fixed on the daunting number on the estimate.\nWilliam raised an eyebrow. \"What brings you here?\"\n\"I got a new car last month. It has a minor issue, so I scheduled a check-up for today.\"\nThe manager nodded repeatedly. \"Ms. Garcia, please have a seat and relax.\"\nAlice, being smart, didn't sit next to William but chose a spot beside Victoria on the same couch.\n\"Ms. Carter, what's wrong? You look so worried. Did something happen?\"\nVictoria took a deep breath, forcing a smile that looked more like a grimace. \"Nothing much, just suddenly owing $100,000.\"\n\"What?\" After hearing the story, Alice quickly tried to mediate. \"William, it's just $100,000. Don't make it hard for Ms. Carter.\"\nVictoria looked at Alice with newfound appreciation. Regardless of her motives, that was a decent thing to say. Coming up with $100,000 all at once was a bit much for her.\n\"I'm not forcing her. She admitted full responsibility and even offered to write an IOU.\"\nVictoria fell silent.\nAlice smiled sweetly. \"Then I'll pay it for her.\"\nVictoria's eyes widened in disbelief. Alice had changed? This was $100,000! And she was offering to help just like that?\nWilliam's brows furrowed, and he finally looked up, giving Alice a cold glance. \"Why should you clean up her mess?\"\n\"Don't say that. We're all friends here. Besides, it's just $100,000. It's not a big deal.\"\nVictoria almost thought she misheard. Alice was acting out of character. $100,000, and she didn't even blink?\nBut William's gaze grew colder. \"Whoever's at fault should take responsibility.\"\nHe glanced at Victoria's slightly pale but still delicate face, noting the fleeting surprise and gratitude in her eyes. His frown deepened. Why hadn't he noticed before how money-hungry she was? A mere $100,000, and she was looking at Alice with such admiration. If he'd known, he would have used money to keep her close.\nVictoria snapped back to reality, her mind clearing. She politely thanked Alice. \"I appreciate your kindness, Ms. Garcia. This man may be annoying, but he's right. If it's my responsibility, I have to bear it. Even if it's a million dollars, I can't shirk it.\"\nAlice turned to William, her voice soft and persuasive. \"William, don't hold it against Ms. Carter. Do it for me, okay?\"\nVictoria never expected Alice to humble herself to plead with William on her behalf.\nWilliam's expression grew darker. He hadn't intended to make her pay. He was just annoyed when she turned to leave and wanted to tease her. Alice's plea gave him an excuse.\nWilliam waved his hand, pretending to be magnanimous. \"Since you asked, I'll let her off the hook.\"\nVictoria thought she'd be happy about the waived compensation, but it felt like a bucket of cold water had been poured over her, revealing a harsh truth. To William, Alice was the special one. A casual word from her could change his mind.\nAlice couldn't hide her joy but carefully concealed it, turning to comfort Victoria. \"Ms. Carter, William is just like a child. Don't take it to heart.\"\nThough she was apologizing for William, her words hinted at their closeness, a bond others couldn't reach.\n\"Of course not. I'm very grateful for William's generosity. But William, rest assured, when I have the money, I'll pay you back in installments.\"\nWilliam narrowed his eyes, letting out a cold snort. \"You're really something. Even your insincere diplomatic words sound smooth.\"\nVictoria gritted her teeth. What was wrong with William today? Couldn't he go a minute without mocking her? But knowing she was in the wrong, she suppressed her anger, forcing a smile. \"It's not insincere. I mean it.\"\n\"You? Mean it?\"\n\"You!\" Victoria really didn't want to say another word to him!",

If you have any questions, ask Harry.\"\nWithout waiting for her response, he turned to Alice, \"Can you give me a ride?\"\nAlice smiled gently, \"Of course.\"\nWatching them leave, Victoria felt a sudden release of tension, followed by an inexplicable sense of loss. She felt exhausted, both physically and mentally, and wanted nothing more than to curl up in a small corner, away from the world.\nOutside the lounge, she could faintly hear the staff's exclamations, \"They make such a perfect couple! Both from wealthy families, good-looking, and rich. Even TV shows can't come up with such a perfect pair!\"\n\"So enviable! If they don't end up together, it would be frustrating!\"\n\"Did you see that? He really dotes on her! She just asked for a favor, and he waived a hundred thousand dollars in losses just like that! What a love story!\"\nVictoria walked out, and even though she didn't have to pay, she couldn't feel happy.\nAfter thinking it over, she decided to return the money. She had asked him for money to pay Nora's hospital bills because she had no other choice. But now, taking advantage of him again would be wrong.\nBack home, Victoria locked herself in her room and started drawing.\nShe had received a commission from a publishing house to provide illustrations for a children's book. She had been procrastinating due to other commitments, but if she could finish this job, combined with her savings and a loan from Alvin, she could gather the hundred thousand dollars to repay William.\nShe carefully sketched, and one by one, the charming cartoon characters began to take shape on the paper.\nShe couldn't help but smile.\nWork was the only thing that could make her forget her troubles.\nVictoria pulled an all-nighter and only took a short nap at dawn.\nWhen she arrived at Starry Studio Gallery with dark circles under her eyes, Wendy was startled, \"Victoria, what happened to you? You look exhausted!\"\nVictoria rubbed her eyes and yawned, \"I stayed up all night working on illustrations.\"\nShe went into the office and downed several cups of coffee to regain some energy.\n\"Victoria, how much do we need to pay for yesterday's incident? I have some savings,\" Wendy said sincerely, sitting next to her.\nVictoria shook her head, \"No need.\"\nWendy frowned, \"It was my fault. I can't let you bear the cost.\"\n\"Wendy, it's fine. We have insurance,\" Victoria reassured her with a smile.\nVictoria didn't want to make Wendy feel bad, so she didn't tell her the truth.\nHearing this, Wendy seemed relieved, and they both went back to their work.\nOn Easter morning, sunlight filtered through the thin clouds, casting a golden glow over the small yard.\nVictoria got up early and started decorating the living room with the carefully chosen decorations.\nLast Christmas, Alvin was still in prison, and she had spent it alone, feeling miserable.\nBut now, Alvin was finally out, and they could celebrate a holiday together.\nAlvin came out of the kitchen, wearing an apron and holding a spatula, ready to serve breakfast. He saw Victoria standing in the living room, smiling to herself.\nHe called out cheerfully, \"Victoria, come have breakfast first.\"\nVictoria obediently responded and walked over to the table.\nAfter breakfast, they started decorating together.\nVictoria handed Alvin a colorful Easter egg, \"Dad, look at this egg. It's so pretty! Let's hang it by the window. It'll look amazing in the sunlight.\"\nAlvin took the egg and examined it closely, his eyes full of warmth, \"Yes, it's very beautiful.\"\nThey chatted as they decorated.\nVictoria carefully hung streamers from the ceiling while Alvin arranged bunny figurines around the room.\nThe fluffy little bunnies added a lively touch to the house.\nSoon, the doorbell rang.\nVictoria opened the door to find Wendy standing there with a big basket, smiling, \"Victoria, I'm here! I brought some homemade treats for Easter. Let's enjoy them together.\"\nVictoria smiled and took the basket, \"Thank you.\"\nWendy was immediately captivated by the cozy decorations inside, \"You two did an amazing job! This looks even better than the gallery!\"\nThe three of them sat around the table, enjoying Wendy's treats, which included sweet and soft hot cross buns and adorable bunny-shaped cookies.\nVictoria couldn't resist taking a big bite of a treat, \"This is delicious, Wendy. You're so talented.\"\nAlvin nodded in agreement, smiling at Wendy, \"Wendy, I've heard from Victoria how much you've helped her. Thank you so much!\"\nWendy quickly replied, \"Mr. Carter, no need to be so formal! Victoria and I are friends!\"\nAs they were talking, the doorbell rang again.\nSamuel stood there with a pot of blooming tulips and a big box of imported chocolates, \"Mr. Carter, Victoria, happy Easter! I thought I'd join the fun.\"\nVictoria welcomed him in with a smile.\nAlvin was even happier to see Samuel.\nHe genuinely liked Samuel.\nSamuel was mature, polite, and clearly in love with Victoria.\nVictoria watched them chat and eat treats while sending holiday greetings to her colleagues, former classmates, and teachers on her phone.\nWhen she scrolled past William's name, she paused.\nDaisy had gone back to Harborview City to be with Garth.\nSo, William was alone.\nNo, Alice was there too. She wouldn't let him be alone.\nAs Victoria was lost in thought, Samuel's phone suddenly rang.\nHe glanced at the caller ID, frowned slightly, and then hung up, continuing to chat with Alvin.\nBut soon, his phone rang again.\nHe hesitated for a moment, then apologized to Victoria and Alvin and stepped aside to take the call.\nVictoria saw the caller ID: Hannah Wright.",

After all, when it comes to matters of the heart, there's no right or wrong, only what feels right.\nSamuel finished his call and smiled awkwardly at Victoria. \"Mr. Carter, Victoria, I gotta go now. I'll visit you another day.\"\nVictoria nodded. \"Drive safe.\"\nAlvin saw Samuel out and then returned to the living room.\nWithin two minutes, Victoria received a message from Samuel: [Victoria, don't get the wrong idea. Ms. Wright is with my parents. My dad's not feeling well, so I need to go check on him.]\nVictoria felt a warmth in her heart as she read the message and smiled slightly. She replied naturally: [I didn't think much of it.]\nIn truth, he didn't need to explain anything.\nBecause no matter what decision Samuel made, Victoria would support him.\nSamuel saw her reply and breathed a sigh of relief.\nEarly that morning, Hannah had been invited over by Primrose and Elmer.\nSamuel had come to Victoria's partly to spend the holiday with her and partly to avoid Hannah.\nBut with Elmer's heart condition, as a son, he had to go back, whether it was serious or not.\nNot long after Samuel left, Wendy came home.\nHer dad was out with his mistress and illegitimate child again, leaving her mom alone.\nShe couldn't stay out too long, worried her mom might do something drastic.\nFor dinner, Alvin prepared a feast, and the father-daughter duo enjoyed it immensely.\nAfter dinner, Victoria cleaned up the dishes and washed the kitchenware.\n\"Victoria, some business partners invited me to play poker. I'll be out for a while. You should get to bed early,\" Alvin advised.\nVictoria grinned. \"Got it. Win big for us!\"\nAlvin laughed heartily.\nAfter Alvin left, Victoria curled up on the couch, flipping through TV channels out of boredom.\nBefore long, her phone rang.\nThe caller was Robert, someone she hadn't heard from in a while.\n\"Victoria, happy Easter,\" Robert said.\n\"Robert, happy Easter. What made you call me out of the blue?\" Victoria asked.\nRobert sounded a bit uneasy. \"Victoria, I took on a case abroad and can't make it back today. Could you check on my mom? She's feeling a bit lonely.\"\nVictoria agreed immediately. \"No problem, Robert. I'll head over now.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Robert said.\n\"Don't mention it. Elara took such good care of me before. It's the least I can do,\" Victoria replied.\nAfter a bit more small talk, they hung up.\nVictoria quickly gathered some things and took a cab to Elara's house.\nElara was delighted to see Victoria. \"Victoria, what a surprise! Come in, come in.\"\n\"Robert's busy with work, so he asked me to keep you company,\" Victoria explained.\nElara frowned. \"That boy, always troubling others.\"\nVictoria linked arms with Elara, smiling. \"Elara, even if Robert hadn't asked, I wanted to see you. It's been too long.\"\nElara beamed. \"Really? I've missed you too!\"\nVictoria took out the fruits she brought and placed them on the table. She pulled up a chair next to Elara, and they chatted while watching TV.\nThey talked until Elara grew sleepy, and Victoria got up to leave.\nBefore she left, Elara seemed hesitant, as if she had something to say but couldn't.\nSensing this, Victoria asked softly, \"Elara, is there something you want to tell me?\"\nAfter a moment of thought, Elara looked at Victoria. \"Victoria, you should go upstairs and see. The apartment you used to rent is now occupied by William. He insisted on buying it at a high price.\"\nVictoria was stunned, her face changing color.\nWilliam living in that tiny apartment?\n\"Elara, are you sure he's here?\"\nElara sighed. \"I'm not certain, but you should check it out.\"\nWith mixed emotions, Victoria headed upstairs.\nStanding outside her old apartment, Victoria hesitated.\nIt was in this very room that she learned about Alvin's involvement in William's parents' deaths and that Alvin's imprisonment was his doing.\nWilliam had tormented her to get back at Alvin.\nThat day, Victoria had truly hated him.\nBut later, William nearly lost his life saving Alvin.\nThese tangled events left Victoria confused.\nShe couldn't love him, but she couldn't muster the hate either.\n\"What are you doing here?\" A deep voice startled her. \nShe turned quickly to see William's almost perfect face. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\"Just getting some fresh air,\" he said, adding, \"This is my home now.\"\nIn other words, whatever he was doing here, it was perfectly normal.\n\"And you?\" William asked, looking directly into her eyes.\nVictoria couldn't bring herself to ask, \"Why are you living in my old apartment?\"\nFeeling awkward, she saw William tilt his head slightly, watching her quietly. Then he smiled and took her arm. \"I haven't had dinner yet. Will you join me?\"\n\"Um... Okay.\"\nVictoria felt a pang of regret as soon as she said it.\nWhat was she doing?\nShe had firmly told Alice she had nothing to do with him, yet here she was, having dinner with him.\nBut Victoria wasn't one to dwell on such things. Since she was already here, she might as well have dinner with an old friend.\nIt wasn't a big deal.\nWith that thought, Victoria felt more at ease.\nAs she entered, she noticed the apartment looked almost the same as when she lived there.\nEven the scattered shoes, paintings, and various decorations were still there.\nSeeing the familiar room, Victoria felt a moment of disorientation, as if nothing had changed, yet everything had.\n\"What are you standing there for? Change your shoes and come in,\" William called from the living room, holding a bottle of expensive red wine.\nVictoria snapped out of it.\nEven if the furnishings hadn't changed, the lifestyle certainly had.\nShe put on the slippers and sat at the dining table.\nThe table was laden with luxurious foods: lobster, king crab, foie gras, caviar-stuffed snails, and more.\nVictoria swallowed and remarked, \"The life of the rich is extravagant. Can you eat all this by yourself?\"\nWilliam glanced at her without answering.\nWhat could he say?\nShould he tell her he had hoped she would join him for the holiday?\nThough he knew it was unlikely, he had still prepared all this food, holding onto a sliver of hope.\nAnd she had come.\nWilliam lowered his eyes, hiding the fleeting joy within.",

        "content": "Victoria casually picked up the remote and turned on some music, selecting a soothing and lively classical piece. The melodious tunes filled the room, adding a touch of warmth to this Easter evening.\nWilliam glanced at her, a faint smile playing on his lips. \"You've got quite the sense of ambiance.\"\n\"With good food and wine, how could we not enjoy some music? You don't get it; this is an artist's pursuit,\" Victoria explained earnestly.\n\"An artist, huh?\" William scoffed, taking a sip from his wine glass.\nVictoria pouted. \"Why can't I be an artist? Plenty of people like my paintings.\"\n\"Alright, enough bragging.\" William pushed a glass of wine towards her. \"Try this.\"\nVictoria inhaled the rich aroma of the wine and praised, \"Smells wonderful!\"\n\"Then drink up,\" William said indifferently.\nVictoria took a small sip, savoring it before exclaiming, \"This is excellent wine!\"\nThey continued their dinner under the soft glow of the chandelier, which cast a gentle light over them, creating a cozy atmosphere.\nWilliam suddenly put down his utensils and looked at her. \"Happy Easter.\"\nVictoria was momentarily stunned but then broke into a bright smile. \"Happy Easter.\"\n\"I didn't expect you to come, so I didn't prepare a gift.\"\n\"No worries, I did.\" Victoria pulled a small, intricately decorated Easter egg from her bag and gently slid it across the table. \"Hope you like it.\"\nWilliam paused, his gaze fixed on the egg. It was the first time he had received such a unique gift.\nHe picked up the egg, examining it with curiosity. \"For me?\"\n\"Yes,\" Victoria replied, a bit shyly, lowering her eyes. She had thought that perhaps no one would give him an Easter gift, so she had impulsively bought the egg and kept it with her.\nWilliam carefully placed the egg in a delicate box and closed the lid. \"It's just an egg,\" Victoria said, feeling a bit embarrassed.\nHe shook his head. \"It's precious.\"\nPrecious enough that he didn't know what to give in return.\nSoon, the distant chimes of a church bell echoed through the quiet night, completing the Easter evening tradition.\nThe two of them were so harmonious tonight, like old friends simply sharing a meal, that Victoria almost forgot the past conflicts she had experienced in this house.\nAs she was enjoying her meal, her phone rang.\nShe wiped her hands and answered, \"Samuel, what's up?\"\nWilliam glanced at her, his expression unreadable.\nSamuel had just finished celebrating with his family and called her, wanting to hear her voice and chat for a bit. But after a few minutes, he was called away again.\n\"One of our family friends got drunk, and my dad wants me to drive them home,\" Samuel explained apologetically.\n\"Alright, drive safe,\" Victoria said, hanging up.\nWhen she looked up, she saw William staring at her intently.\n\"What's going on with you and that guy?\" he asked, his tone full of disdain.\n\"His name is Samuel,\" Victoria corrected seriously.\n\"Whatever his name is, it doesn't matter. Victoria, let me tell you, if a guy keeps giving you empty promises, you're not far from being let down.\"\n\"Don't talk about him like that. He's not that kind of person. He's never given me empty promises.\"\nIn fact, it was she who occasionally kept things from him, and she felt guilty about it.\nSeeing her defend Samuel, William scoffed, his voice growing colder. \"So what kind of person is he? Sneaking around with other women behind your back?\"\nVictoria was shocked. \"How do you know?\"\nShe regretted the question as soon as she asked it.\nWilliam glanced at her. \"So you knew all along.\"\nVictoria looked away, speaking softly. \"We're all adults. We're not married, so we have the right to make our own choices.\"\n\"So, coming to see me behind his back is just following adult rules?\" William asked, his tone mocking.\n\"You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?\" Victoria glared at him.\n\"Victoria, are you really that naive?\" William's deep eyes bore into hers. \"He's treating you so poorly, and it'll only get worse.\"\n\"He...\"\nSeeing her about to defend Samuel again, William's anger flared. \"The person I care about is being treated like this by him?\"\nVictoria was stunned.\nShe stared at him, momentarily forgetting how to react, and downed a large glass of wine in one go.\nWilliam wasn't one to mince words. He said what he felt without regret.\nHe even spoke with a hint of arrogance, his tone leaving no room for doubt. \"Are you a pushover or just stupid? If you know he's seeing other women, why not confront him? With me here, what are you afraid of? The Brown family? I can crush them easily.\"\nHis words seemed light, but Victoria knew he had the power to back them up.\nHowever, what shocked her the most was his admission of caring about her.\nVictoria was reluctant to admit the complicated relationship she had with William.\nShe didn't have Stockholm syndrome or a masochistic tendency. She had once had a naive crush on William, harboring girlish fantasies about a future with him.\nShe hated his past actions but understood the reasons behind his change in behavior.\nIn those moments when she was almost swallowed by life's difficulties, it was often William who silently stood by her side, offering a helping hand.\nSo, she didn't want to face her growing feelings for William, nor did she dare to acknowledge the subtle, inexplicable attraction between them.\nIt felt like they were destined by fate to either be bitter enemies or strangers passing by.\nIf they tried to break free from this predetermined path and defy societal norms to be together, not only would others judge them, but she would also fall into deep self-loathing and disgust.\nIn the end, she pretended not to hear William's words.\nAfter a suffocating silence, Victoria poured herself another full glass of wine and spoke firmly. \"This is my personal matter. I don't want anyone interfering.\"\nHer words were decisive, leaving no room for argument.\nWilliam let out a cold laugh, seemingly unconcerned with her opinion. He said nothing more and finished his half-full glass of wine.\nThe two of them, as if in a silent contest, continued to drink in silence, neither willing to back down.\nThe elegant piano music flowed, evoking a sense of tranquility, yet it only highlighted the tense atmosphere between them.\nTime passed, and the food on the table remained mostly untouched, while three or four bottles of wine were emptied. Both of their faces were flushed, their eyes hazy and unfocused.",

She tried to push him away a few times but couldn't, so she just let him hold her.\nBefore long, they both tumbled onto the soft couch.\nVictoria felt her body getting hotter. She pushed at William, mumbling, \"William, let go of me. I'm so hot.\"\nWilliam held her down, his rough thumb gently tracing her delicate skin, his eyes dark and intense. \"I'm hot too,\" he murmured.\nVictoria squirmed a bit but couldn't escape the heat of his breath on her skin. She struggled for a moment, then gave up, lying obediently on the couch. With the last bit of her rationality, she mumbled, \"Don't do anything crazy.\"\nHer cheeks were flushed, her eyes sparkling, and her long lashes fluttered like butterfly wings, tempting him closer.\nWilliam's throat tightened as he gazed at her with burning eyes.\nThey were so close, their noses almost touching, their breaths mingling intimately.\nHe slowly moved to her lips, capturing her soft, inviting mouth, exploring and tasting her.\nHis hot breath on her sensitive neck made her shiver.\nVictoria couldn't help but tremble, trying to avoid him but unable to. She looked at him through hazy eyes and called his name, \"William?\"\nWilliam stopped and looked at her.\nThe bright lights illuminated her cute, delicate features, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears, captivating him.\nHer cheeks were pink, flushed from the alcohol.\nWilliam's eyes darkened. He held her waist with one hand and slipped the other under her nightgown, gently caressing her breasts through the fabric.\nVictoria let out a soft moan, her legs trembling slightly, her body pressing against his firm abdomen, melting into him.\nWilliam leaned down, biting her earlobe, and asked in a low voice, \"Victoria, do you like me?\"\n\"Yes...\"\nBefore she could finish, his tongue traced the edge of her ear, licking every inch of her sensitive skin.\nVictoria's body tingled from his sudden intimacy, and she instinctively clutched his shirt.\nWilliam's lips moved to her neck, leaving light marks. Victoria couldn't help but moan, her body shivering as if electrified.\n\"Do you like it?\" William asked again, his voice even huskier, his hand moving up her side, touching her through her thin underwear.\nVictoria was panting, tears streaming down her face. She shook her head desperately, sobbing, \"No, don't do this.\"\n\"Don't do what?\" His voice was even more seductive, filled with temptation.\nWilliam's fingers teased her nipples while his other hand squeezed her buttocks, making her shiver.\nVictoria felt her whole body burning, a strange sensation spreading inside her. She whimpered, \"William.\"\nHer voice was so alluring that it ignited a fire in William, his arousal becoming unbearable.\nWilliam suddenly unzipped her dress, pulling down her underwear, and eagerly entered her.\nTheir bodies fit together perfectly, her tight, wet warmth enveloping him completely.\nVictoria felt full and stretched, their bodies pressed tightly together, as if he wanted to push even deeper.\nShe cried softly, her voice broken.\nWilliam held her tightly, whispering with satisfaction, \"Victoria, can you feel it? I'm all the way in.\"\nHe began to move, each thrust pulling at her soft flesh, making her even wetter.\nHis movements brought indescribable pleasure.\nVictoria's body trembled, her head thrown back in helpless gasps.\nWilliam kissed her neck, gripping her buttocks and thrusting deeper, hitting a spot inside her that made her tighten around him, her thighs trembling.\nHe continued to hit that spot, and soon Victoria's cries turned into soft, breathy moans.\nWhen she didn't respond, he thrust even harder, hitting her sensitive spot repeatedly.\nPleasure spread from her core to her spine, making Victoria's toes curl and her chest heave.\nWilliam grabbed one of her breasts, his rough fingers rubbing her nipple, making it swell and ache.\nThe mix of pain and pleasure made her tighten around him even more.\nHer wet heat gripped him tightly, and William bit her lip, stealing her breath. After several thrusts, he released his hot, thick seed deep inside her.\nVictoria's body shuddered from the heat, his length still pulsing inside her.\nWilliam held her close, his breathing heavy with satisfaction.\nVictoria was dizzy from his kisses, her body limp and exhausted.\nHe kissed her cheek lightly, his voice hoarse and magnetic, \"I love you.\"\nVictoria, dazed by his breath, couldn't hear him clearly.\nShe only vaguely sensed him saying, \"I love you, Victoria.\"\nWhen Victoria woke up, it was just before dawn.\nThe space beside her was empty.\nVictoria rubbed her aching head, pulled off the blanket, and got up to wash.\nThey had drunk a lot last night, and she couldn't remember what happened after they passed out.\nBut she felt clean and fresh, so nothing too crazy must have happened, right? Victoria thought, relieved.\nShe quickly got dressed and hurried home.\nLuckily, Alvin had gotten drunk with friends last night and was still asleep, unaware that Victoria hadn't come home.\nOtherwise, she would have faced a scolding.\nShe went back to bed for a bit.\nShe hadn't slept long when voices at the door woke her.\nSamuel had come early to take her to his place.\n\"Are you really taking me to your house?\" Victoria looked at Samuel with sincere eyes.",

You don't have to go through all this.\"\nSamuel looked out the window, lost in thought for a moment. Then he turned back to her, speaking earnestly, \"Victoria, we've been through a lot to get here. I know you trust me, but some things need more than just feelings. I need to show you my commitment, to let everyone know you're the most important person to me. So, I have to do that.\"\nHis eyes, usually bright and gentle, were now serious and determined.\nVictoria was taken aback for a moment before she finally nodded. It felt like saying \"no\" would pull him into an abyss.\n\"You knew I met with someone else, and you didn't even ask about it! Victoria, do you really care about me?\"\n\"Of course I do...\"\n\"Then come meet my parents!\"\nVictoria bit her lip and nodded slightly, \"I understand.\"\nShe knew deep down whether Samuel's feelings had changed. Since she decided to be with him, she was willing to respect his decisions and stand by his side. That was her role as his girlfriend.\nBringing Victoria to meet his parents was a big deal.\nPrimrose was kind, at least on the surface, always polite to Victoria.\nBut Elmer wasn't one for pretense. Maybe because of work stress, he looked even more grim and tired, his face showing clear displeasure and annoyance.\nAfter welcoming Victoria into the living room, Primrose smiled and said, \"Samuel, come help me in the kitchen.\"\nSamuel frowned, \"I'd rather stay here with Victoria for a bit.\"\n\"You can chat later. Come help me first.\"\nSamuel was about to refuse, but Victoria gently tugged at his sleeve, \"Go ahead, I'll be fine.\"\nSamuel frowned slightly, a hint of reluctance in his eyes. He knew it wasn't ideal to leave Victoria alone with Elmer.\nBut seeing the hopeful look in Primrose's eyes, he thought maybe this was a chance to ease the tension.\nAfter a brief moment of thought, he gently patted Victoria's shoulder, \"Victoria, I'll be right back. If you feel uncomfortable, just let me know, and I'll take you home.\"\nVictoria smiled softly, \"Go on.\"\nElmer heard everything and snorted heavily, \"Your mom is waiting for you. Stop dawdling and get in there!\"\nSamuel frowned slightly, taking a deep breath to calm himself.\nHe stepped forward, standing in front of Victoria, and said calmly, \"Dad, I understand your concerns, but Victoria is the one I've chosen. My feelings for her are not a passing whim.\"\nHe stood tall, his gaze unwavering as he looked Elmer in the eye.\nElmer's face showed a flash of anger, but he held it back, saying in a low voice, \"Fine, I understand.\"\nSamuel frowned again before slowly walking into the kitchen.\nVictoria looked up at Elmer, the awkward silence between them almost suffocating her.\n\"Ms. Carter, I don't mean to target you, but you and Samuel are not suitable for each other.\" Elmer's sharp gaze fell directly on her, \"Your past with William can be seen as youthful indiscretion. But our family is traditional; we won't accept a daughter-in-law with unclear relationships with another man.\"\nHis voice was low and cold, offering no quarter.\nThough she had anticipated this, hearing the blunt \"you're not suitable\" still felt like a punch to the gut for Victoria, leaving her heart aching.\n\"I know Samuel likes you a lot. No matter how we try to dissuade him, he's determined to be with you. So, Ms. Carter, I hope you can understand our concerns as parents. We hope you will leave him voluntarily. You don't have to break up immediately; give him some time to accept it. After a while, you can say your feelings have faded or that you've found someone else. That way, it will be easier for him to move on.\"\nVictoria stared at him, stunned. Elmer's words showed no regard for her feelings or dignity, as if everything he said was perfectly justified.\nShe understood that parents favored their own children, but did that mean she deserved to be treated so poorly?\n\"Ms. Carter, I know this request is excessive, but we've made our stance clear before. If you insist on staying, you must bear the consequences. Frankly, we prefer Hannah. In terms of family background, ability, and manners, she is far more suitable for Samuel than you. A relationship without parental blessing is unlikely to end well. No matter how many promises Samuel makes now, who can guarantee he won't change in a few years? When that time comes, will he return to his family or stay with you, the one who caused the rift? Ms. Carter, you're a smart person. I'm sure you understand.\"\nVictoria sat in the Brown family's living room, feeling utterly devalued, unable to utter a single word in rebuttal.\nElmer's words were harsh but realistic.\nShe didn't want Samuel to be estranged from his family because of her. Even if it came to that, could she give him the same deep love in return?\nCould she?\n\"Ms. Carter, I won't let you sacrifice in vain. I know your father's company is just starting to grow. I'll do my best to help his business, improving your lives significantly. Of course, you don't have to answer right away. Take your time to consider.\"\nWithout waiting for her response, Elmer checked his watch, \"Today, Hannah and her parents are also coming over. If you want to stay for lunch, that's fine, but it might be awkward to introduce you. We don't mind; as long as you don't, it's fine.\"\nIf Elmer had been deliberately difficult or verbally abusive, Victoria could have mustered the courage to fight back. But his cold, business-like demeanor, discussing pros and cons without considering her feelings, left her feeling insignificant.\nIf she still insisted on staying, it would only prove to the Wright family how desirable Samuel was and made her look like she was trying to climb a ladder she couldn't reach.\nVictoria felt the stark reality.\nShe had been too naive, thinking a boyfriend who made her feel comfortable and compatible was enough. Samuel's kindness had indeed moved her.\nBut Elmer's blunt reality check deflated her courage and made her want to retreat.\nShe couldn't bear to make Samuel turn against his parents for her.\nMoreover, to win his parents' favor, she would have to humble herself, which went against her nature.\nAfter talking with Elmer, she wanted to back out.\nElmer, having said his piece, got up and left.\nSoon, Samuel hurried out of the kitchen, looking anxious, worried that Elmer had been harsh with her.\nHe quickly walked to her side, bending down to ask gently, \"What did my dad say to you?\"\n\"Nothing much, just some small talk.\"\nVictoria paused for a moment, then said softly, \"I suddenly don't feel like staying for the meal.\"",

He sighed softly, took off his jacket, and draped it over her shoulders. \"Alright, I'll take you home.\"\nShe wanted to refuse, knowing that Hannah was coming over soon, and it wouldn't be proper if he wasn't there to greet her.\nBut Samuel's face was stern as he grabbed their coats, gave a few quick instructions to the housekeeper, and hurried out with her.\nAs their car was about to leave the gates of The Brown Villa, it passed by the Wright family's car.\nVictoria glanced out the window and saw Hannah.\n\"She's the Ms. Wright you met at the restaurant the other day, right?\"\nA flicker of embarrassment crossed Samuel's face before he regained his composure. \"Yeah, her name's Hannah.\"\nVictoria nodded slightly. \"She's very pretty.\"\n\"You saw her, and you don't feel never mind.\" Samuel felt a tightness in his chest, like something was blocking his breath.\nHannah also noticed his car, her gaze lingering on it briefly, a hint of confusion in her eyes.\n\"Dad, stop the car!\" Hannah's clear voice rang out.\nHer father immediately hit the brakes.\nHannah pushed open the door and, like a nimble deer, ran to the roadside, waving her arms energetically. \"Samuel! Samuel!\"\nHer voice was particularly loud in the crisp early spring air, filled with a mix of girlish charm and anticipation.\nBy this time, Samuel's car had already driven a short distance from The Brown Villa's gate.\nSeeing this, Victoria quickly said, \"Samuel, stop the car.\"\n\"What for?\" Samuel turned his head slightly, a hint of displeasure in his expression, his brows furrowing. \"You know who she is, but you don't seem to care?\"\nVictoria understood that the Wright family had connections with the Brown family, so they were all coming to visit today.\nVictoria had to think about Samuel's position and not make things difficult for him, despite her awkwardness.\nWhile she was thinking, Hannah had already run over.\nSamuel remained seated in the driver's seat, his back straight, unmoved.\nVictoria couldn't pretend not to see. She rolled down the window and offered a polite smile. \"Ms. Wright, hello.\"\nHannah's eyes flashed with a quick, fleeting surprise. She glanced at Victoria briefly, then smiled back with a simple, \"Hi.\"\nThen she turned her attention to Samuel, asking enthusiastically, \"Samuel, are you going out?\"\n\"Yeah.\" Samuel responded absentmindedly, glancing at her briefly, his expression clearly saying, \"I don't want to deal with you right now.\"\n\"When will you be back? I'll wait for you!\" Hannah asked warmly, seemingly oblivious to his coldness.\n\"Is there something you need?\" Samuel's voice was deep and rich, tinged with emotion. He was still upset about Victoria's earlier indifference.\n\"Nothing much, just wanted to chat with you.\" Hannah was slightly taken aback, probably not expecting Samuel to be so unkind.\nShe then looked at Victoria, her gaze inscrutable.\nVictoria knew that Hannah was affected by her presence, but it wasn't the right time to address it. She lowered her voice and gently chided Samuel, \"Be nicer to Ms. Wright. She's a girl, don't make her feel uncomfortable.\"\nSamuel sighed softly, as if resigned to Victoria's kindness, or perhaps convincing himself to let go of his emotions.\nSamuel adjusted his posture slightly, turned to face Hannah, and put on a polite smile. \"Ms. Wright, what I meant was, I'm really busy today and probably won't have time. Don't wait up for me.\"\nThough his words were perfunctory, Hannah smiled again upon hearing his explanation. \"Alright, we'll chat another time.\"\nBefore leaving, she playfully waved at him. \"I'll be waiting for your call.\"\nShe looked every bit like a girl in love.\nBefore leaving, she gave Victoria a thoughtful glance.\nSamuel stepped on the gas, and the car sped away.\nInside the car, Victoria knew what he was upset about. After a moment of silence, she cautiously looked at him and said softly, \"It's not that I don't care. I just have faith in you, so I didn't question you. I believe you have your reasons.\"\n\"You have so much faith in me, I should be happy, right? But no matter how much faith you have, knowing your boyfriend is meeting another woman, you should still be a little upset, right?\" Samuel said, though her words warmed his heart, and his grip on the steering wheel relaxed slightly.\n\"If you understand that, then why did you go? No matter the reason, meeting another woman when you have a girlfriend isn't good for either of us, right?\" Victoria tilted her chin slightly, her gaze stubborn.\nSamuel was momentarily speechless, opening his mouth but saying nothing.\nAfter a moment, he shook his head lightly, as if mocking his own actions or marveling at Victoria's perceptiveness.\nDuring a red light, he gently ruffled her hair, his touch tender and affectionate. \"Now you're finally acting like a girlfriend.\"\nThere was a hint of a smile in his voice, as if the earlier tension had dissipated.\nVictoria huffed, pretending to be angry. \"I'm understanding, and you don't appreciate it? Fine, let's hurt each other then!\"\n\"Yes, yes, it's my fault. I shouldn't have met another woman behind my dear girlfriend's back.\" Samuel apologized, but there was a hint of pride on his face, feeling pleased that she cared about him.\nBack at The Carter Villa, Victoria urged him to go back.\n\"You're so eager for me to go back and see her?\" Samuel's tone was calm, but the slight rise in his voice betrayed his emotions.\nVictoria couldn't help but smile. She said softly, \"It's basic courtesy and represents your family's hospitality. Besides, would you do anything to betray me?\"\n\"Of course not!\" Samuel denied without hesitation.\nVictoria smiled and said, \"So, what are you worried about?\"\nSamuel stared at her face, then suddenly leaned in and kissed her on the lips, quickly pulling back with a satisfied smile.\nVictoria was stunned for a moment, her face turning red. She playfully slapped him a few times. \"You rascal, get going!\"\n\"Bye-bye!\" Samuel winked at her before stepping on the gas and driving away.\nVictoria stood there, watching the taillights fade into the distance, lost in thought.\nAfter a while, she turned to unlock the door.\nTo her surprise, she heard familiar voices inside.\n\"Alvin, please help us! For the sake of our years together, help Bobby and me. I have no other options.\" Nora's voice was trembling with tears.\n\"Dad, even though I'm not your biological son, we've been family for years. Please help me.. I don't want to go back to prison. It's unbearable there. I beg you!\" Bobby's voice was even more desperate.\nBobby?\nVictoria was shocked.\nWasn't he in prison? How did he get out?",

        "content": "Victoria had been eavesdropping for a while before she finally pieced together that Bobby had been granted medical parole to donate a kidney to Nora.\nWhat a sneaky move!\nVictoria's lips twisted into a mocking smile. She didn't buy for a second that Nora would actually let Bobby go through with the donation.\nIt was just a temporary fix.\nSure enough, Bobby soon started whining, each word more pitiful and dramatic than the last.\n\"What do you need help with? Why don't you just tell me?\" Victoria strode into the living room, breaking the awkward silence.\nIn the living room, Nora and Bobby were sitting on the couch, looking pretty downcast.\nBobby had a fresh buzz cut and was dressed in simple, loose clothing. He looked much thinner and more worn out, a far cry from his former self.\nHe seemed especially cautious and quiet, a stark contrast to his previous arrogance.\nNora sat beside him, occasionally dabbing at her eyes with a tissue, looking as if she had suffered a great injustice.\nAlvin sat across from them, his face dark and silent.\nHearing Victoria's voice, Bobby's body trembled slightly before he quickly lowered his head, as if ashamed to meet her gaze.\n\"Victoria, you're back.\" Nora glanced at her and greeted her indifferently.\nAfter the last suicide incident, Nora's heart had turned cold. She now saw Victoria as being in cahoots with that wretched Daisy.\n\"I'm still your mother. When you see me, shouldn't you at least ask how I'm doing? Even if you don't like me or acknowledge me as your mother, blood ties can't be severed.\" Nora felt disgruntled.\nVictoria paused for a moment, then said in a flat tone, \"How are you feeling?\"\nThough Victoria asked out of obligation, Nora acted as if she hadn't heard, her gaze drifting elsewhere, ignoring her.\nVictoria sat down next to Alvin. \"Dad, you've been catching up with them for a while now. You must be tired. Why don't you go upstairs and rest? I'll handle things here.\"\nAlvin gave her a deep look. \"Can you manage?\"\nShe smiled faintly, her expression calm. \"It's just entertaining guests. What's so difficult about that? I'm not a clueless child anymore. I've seen my fair share of these complicated dealings.\"\nGuests?\nNora bit her lip and glared at her hatefully upon hearing this.\n\"Alright then.\" Alvin didn't want to get entangled with Nora any further. He stood up immediately, his steps hurried, not even bothering with a polite farewell.\n\"Alvin! I'm not done talking. You can't leave!\" Nora, panicking, tried to get up and stop him.\nVictoria stepped in front of Nora with a smile.\n\"Get out of my way!\" Nora snapped at her angrily.\n\"Mom, I suggest you sit down and talk to me, your daughter. After all, I'm the one who was victimized by Bobby's crimes.\" Victoria's tone was equally indifferent.\nNora turned to glare at her, gritting her teeth, and hissed, \"Don't think that just because your father is back, you have someone to back you up. Let me tell you, I've been married to him for years. Sooner or later, we'll reconcile and be as good as new!\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes, a mocking smile playing on her lips. She chuckled softly, \"Just cut to the chase. Why are you really here?\"\nShe then turned her sharp gaze to Bobby. \"And you, how did you manage to get out of prison so quickly?\"\nHer words dripped with sarcasm, making Bobby's face flush red. The arrogance and swagger he once had were long gone. Now, he looked down, speaking timidly, \"I'm on medical parole to donate a kidney to Mom.\"\n\"Really?\" Victoria raised an eyebrow, her eyes full of amusement. \"I remember when they did the matching tests before, they said your kidney wasn't a match. How did it suddenly become a match after a few months in prison?\"\nHer feigned surprise infuriated Nora.\n\"Victoria, watch your tone! How can you talk to Bobby like that?\" Nora scolded.\nVictoria glanced at Nora, her voice dripping with sarcasm. \"Does he deserve my respect? This shameless bastard.\"\nSeeing Nora about to retort, Bobby gently tugged at her sleeve, speaking softly, \"Mom, I understand why Victoria is angry with me. I acted impulsively before and hurt her. It's understandable that she's still upset and doesn't want to talk to me. Please, calm down.\"\nAs Bobby spoke, his eyes reddened, as if he genuinely cared about Victoria.\nVictoria sighed inwardly. Bobby's acting was quite good, but she had seen too many of these fake acts growing up.\nSure enough, Nora immediately patted his hand, comforting him, \"Alright, let's not bring up the past. She's already had you locked up for months. She should be over it by now. How long does she plan to hold a grudge? What more does she want?\"\nThen, she looked at Victoria, her eyes full of resentment, her tone commanding, \"I came here for one thing. You need to paint a few pictures for Bobby. First, to publicly announce that you two have reconciled; second, so he can use a new pen name and make a fresh start in the art world.\"\nBobby kept his head down, waiting obediently for Victoria's response.\nVictoria resisted the urge to roll her eyes.\nSo she was supposed to be the one to suffer?\n\"Why should I?\" Victoria sounded as if she had heard the most ridiculous thing. \"Are you two out of your minds? Is your brain foggy, or did I hear wrong?\"\nShe pointed at Bobby. \"He locked me up, tortured me, and nearly killed me! And you want me to paint for him so he can re-enter the art world? Mom, are you crazy?\"\nBobby bit his lip, his eyes reddening, and stammered, \"I was in a bad mental state back then. I didn't know what I was doing.\"\n\"So, you're saying you have a mental illness?\"\n\"Yeah, I was diagnosed.\"\nVictoria let out a cold laugh, mercilessly mocking him. \"If your brain is sick, why be an artist? You should stay in prison and stop causing trouble!\"\nBobby opened his mouth, looking to Nora for help.\nNora's eyes widened in anger, shouting, \"Victoria! How can you say that? He's your brother!\"\nVictoria had secretly turned on her camera when she entered the room, recording their conversation.\nIf it weren't for wanting to capture their ugly faces on record, she wouldn't have wasted her breath on them.",

        "content": "Nora noticed Victoria's silence and assumed she had given in.\nShe commanded, \"I've already talked to your dad. His design company has some connections in the art world, so we'll start by setting up an exhibition for Bobby. Once his legal issues are sorted out, he'll change his name and start fresh. With you painting for him, he'll be famous again in no time!\"\nBobby kept glancing at Victoria, his eyes full of hope. \"Dad's company might be small, but with Professor Brown's help, we'll be fine.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Nora said, looking at Bobby with a doting expression. \"Bobby was born to be an artist. A little setback is nothing. We'll bounce back! Plus, signing with your dad's company is also a way to support him.\"\nNora continued, her tone condescending, like a seasoned art critic, \"If we hire a new artist, it would take a lot of time and money upfront, with no guarantee of success. But Bobby's already got a lot of buzz, so we can save a ton on marketing!\"\nVictoria listened to their self-serving conversation in silence for a while before finally speaking up. \"Bobby, I thought after everything that happened, you'd have learned something. But you're still just as unreasonable!\"\nShe paused, muttering, \"But with a mom like that spoiling you, it's no wonder.\"\nNora, used to being domineering in front of Victoria, didn't think she needed to be polite to get her to do something. Her tone grew even more forceful. \"This time, the painting has to be better than your previous works. I know you can do it, and Bobby has the talent. This has to be perfect!\"\nBobby, fired up by her words, his eyes shining and cheeks flushed, said, \"Mom, I won't let you down!\"\nVictoria watched the mother and son duo, stunned. She hadn't even agreed, and they were already planning their success?\nShe pressed her lips together, glaring at them coldly for a moment before suddenly laughing. \"You two are dreaming!\"\nVictoria had had enough. She knew that arguing with them was just a waste of time and would only make her more upset.\n\"You're kicking me out before I even finish talking? Victoria! Is this how I raised you?\"\n\"Mom, don't get upset. It's not good for your health,\" Bobby reminded.\n\"Look at her, treating me like an enemy. How can I not be angry?\"\nVictoria grabbed a decorative item from the table and smashed it on the ground.\nBobby and Nora jumped, staring at her in shock.\n\"Get out! Stop causing trouble here!\" Victoria shouted.\nWith that, she stormed upstairs, leaving a stunned Nora and Bobby behind.\nA few days later, a video of Nora and Bobby pressuring Victoria to paint for them started circulating in the art community.\nThough the video was shot from a clever angle that didn't show their faces, the conversation made it clear who they were. Those familiar with the situation quickly identified Nora and Bobby, turning them into a laughingstock.\nBobby had previously stolen Victoria's painting to win a silver award in a competition and then falsely claimed that her gold-winning piece was his. When this deceit was exposed, he even kidnapped and imprisoned Victoria.\nBobby's crime of kidnapping was serious, and getting medical parole was already a lenient act. Expecting the victim to help him make a comeback was pure fantasy!\nAnd Nora, as a mother, had no boundaries in her favoritism towards Bobby. She brought him to Victoria's home, demanding she paint to help his comeback. It was sheer madness!\nThe internet was flooded with insults and ridicule.\nHarry watched the edited funny video, laughing so hard he didn't notice William walking out of his office.\n\"What's so funny?\" William asked, his voice cutting through Harry's laughter.\n\"Just a funny video,\" Harry replied, quickly trying to hide his phone when he realized who was standing there.\nWilliam had been particularly sensitive to the name \"Victoria\" lately, and any mention of her put him in a foul mood. So, Harry definitely didn't want him to see this video.\nWilliam didn't say a word, just extended his hand.\nHarry hesitated for a moment before reluctantly handing over his phone.\nWilliam looked down at the screen, hearing Nora's arrogant tone in the video. His brow furrowed, and he spoke coldly, \"Find out how Bobby got out.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Harry replied, quickly taking back his phone, fearing William might smash it in anger.\nHe then reminded him, \"Mr. Scott, there's an important investment seminar this afternoon.\" \nThe highly anticipated investment seminar was held at an exclusive private club in Silvermist City.\nAttendees included wealthy businesspeople from across the country, covering a wide range of industries.\nThe moment William stepped into the banquet hall, he caused quite a stir.\nAt twenty-eight, dressed in a black suit that highlighted his tall, lean frame, he was strikingly handsome. His deep, narrow eyes were sharp as blades, exuding an intimidating aura.\nBoth men and women couldn't help but steal glances at him, their eyes filled with admiration.\n\"Is that the president of the Scott Group? He's so young and handsome, no wonder he's the dream man of so many single women!\"\n\"Yeah, I'd marry him even if I had to pay for it!\"\n\"Dream on! Mr. Scott isn't just any man! He's handsome and capable, with countless admirers. Do you really think you stand a chance?\"\n\"Enough already.\"\nThe chatter among the women was incessant.\n\"Mr. Scott is here!\"\nThose skilled in socializing immediately put on their most ingratiating smiles, hurrying over to greet him warmly.\nThe Scott Group, under William's leadership, had been on a meteoric rise in recent years, backed by the powerful Scott family. Their strength was formidable.\nIn the fiercely competitive business world, everyone was eager to collaborate with the Scott Group, hoping to seize an opportunity to soar.\nAlvin was out of town, so Victoria attended the seminar in his place.\nHer gaze casually swept across the open-air venue, and she spotted William in the crowd.\nHer heart gave a slight, almost imperceptible tremor, but she quickly looked away, maintaining her composure.\nVictoria had gained some recognition in the local art scene and was Joshua's only student.\nMany fashionable socialites wanted to chat and take pictures with her.\nTo help promote Alvin's company, Victoria kept a polite smile, patiently engaging with these ladies.\nThrough the dense crowd, William's gaze occasionally fell on her, his eyes flickering with an unreadable light.\nToday, Victoria wore a light purple evening gown with a V-neck design, elegant and noble. A light purple crystal flower adorned her chest, making her look charming and delicate.\nHer waist was cinched tightly, accentuating her full, rounded bust.\nAlready stunningly beautiful, she looked like a blooming rose, captivating and radiant.\nWilliam's eyes darkened as he watched her smile and nod at those around her, a sudden, inexplicable irritation rising within him.",

        "content": "What is Victoria doing?\nShe's doing this on purpose!\nDressing up like that just to get his attention?\nWilliam couldn't help but frown, feeling more and more disgusted with this seductive version of Victoria.\nShe was like a poppy flower-he knew he should stay away, yet he couldn't stop himself from being drawn to her.\nWilliam's teeth were nearly grinding to dust. He wanted nothing more than to drag her home and lock her away, forbidding any other man from even glancing at her!\n\"William!\" Alice approached him with graceful steps. \"I didn't expect you to come in person. I thought you'd send an assistant.\"\nHe pulled his gaze away, his expression lazy, his tone as calm as water. \"This seminar is crucial for the future of Silvermist City's business landscape. It's important to show some sincerity.\"\nAlice stepped closer, gently tugging at his sleeve and lowering her voice. \"That's Andrew McClellan from X-STAR Solutions Inc.\"\nX-STAR Solutions Inc. and the Scott Group were in the middle of critical negotiations. They had reached a preliminary agreement, and after Jerald returned to headquarters, he sent his brother Andrew to handle the follow-up.\nWilliam turned his head to see a young, arrogant man striding confidently into the room. Many people around him eagerly approached with smiles and greetings.\nAndrew walked into the venue with his head held high, suddenly stopping to stare directly at Victoria in the crowd. \"Who's that?\"\nHis secretary followed his gaze and quickly explained, \"Her name is Victoria Carter. She used to be Mr. Scott's secretary at the Scott Group. Now she's a somewhat famous artist.\"\nAndrew's interest was piqued, a wicked smile curling on his lips as he strode over to introduce himself. \"Ms. Carter, hello! I'm Andrew McClellan from X-STAR Solutions Inc. Jerald is my brother.\"\nUsing his brother's name to flaunt his status?\nVictoria's lips curved into a polite smile, and she nodded slightly. \"Hello, Mr. McClellan.\"\nShe had heard of X-STAR Solutions Inc. It had grown rapidly in recent years and gained considerable international recognition.\nIf she could secure investment from X-STAR Solutions Inc., it would be a huge boost for Alvin's company.\nWith that in mind, she treated Andrew with even more warmth and sincerity.\n\"I've admired your artwork for a long time, Ms. Carter! Could we take a photo together?\"\n\"You flatter me, Mr. McClellan. Of course, we can take a photo!\" Victoria stepped forward gracefully.\nHowever, she didn't expect Andrew to place his hand on her shoulder and pull her closer.\nHer smile froze, and her brow furrowed slightly.\nBut in such a public setting, if she were to lose her temper abruptly, it would only make her appear petty and lacking in social grace.\nShe reassured herself that it was just a photo and it would be over soon.\nBut after looking at the photo his secretary took, Andrew shook his head in disdain. \"This one's no good. The lighting is terrible. Let's take another! Make sure it's a good one this time.\"\nHe stood next to Victoria again, this time wrapping his arm around her waist and pulling her even closer, a playful smile on his face. \"Ms. Carter, you have such a slender waist!\"\nVictoria's face darkened. She wanted to push him away, but she couldn't make a scene. She had to hold back her anger, resisting the urge to slap him.\nNot far away, William was chatting and laughing with some industry bigwigs, seemingly casual, but his eyes were always on Victoria, a cold glint in his gaze.\n\"Alright, let's take this one. Come on, another shot!\" Andrew seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself, changing poses and urging his secretary to keep taking photos.\nWilliam suddenly slammed his champagne glass onto the table and said softly, \"Excuse me,\" before turning and striding towards Victoria without hesitation.\n\"William!\" Alice saw everything and quickly followed, her expression anxious. \"That's Andrew! Jerald's brother! We can't afford to offend him right now.\"\nWilliam ignored her, deftly unbuttoning his coat and casually rolling up his sleeves, exuding an undeniable sense of authority.\nMeanwhile, Victoria had reached her limit. Andrew kept using the excuse of taking photos to harass her, leaning on her and half-hugging her, his hands never staying still.\nVictoria used the last of her patience to hold back. \"Mr. McClellan, I think we've taken enough photos.\"\nJust as she spoke, she was shocked to see Andrew's hand on her shoulder being forcefully grabbed and flung away by a strong hand.\n\"Mr. McClellan, I'd like a photo with Ms. Carter too. Are you done yet?\" As William spoke, he naturally placed his arm around Victoria's shoulder.\nHe stood there, tall and relaxed, without any extra intimacy, yet the two of them side by side looked inexplicably harmonious.\nA handsome man and a beautiful woman, like something out of a fairy tale.\nVictoria looked up at him, lowering her voice. \"What are you doing here?\"\nWilliam didn't look at her, just slightly curled his lips, his voice cold as ice. \"If I didn't come, he'd have his hands all over you by now.\"\nVictoria's cheeks flushed instantly. \"It's not as bad as you're making it sound.\"\n\"Really? So I'm overreacting? Fine, I'll leave then.\"\nWilliam pretended to leave, but Victoria quickly grabbed his coat. \"You're already here.\"\nWilliam's lips curled into a mocking smile, and he chuckled softly, his hand gently wrapping around her waist.\nVictoria stiffened, her body going rigid. She glared at him, warning him not to push his luck.\nAndrew was annoyed by William's interruption but kept a smile on his face. \"And you are?\"\nHis secretary quickly stepped forward to introduce him. \"Mr. McClellan, this is Mr. Scott, the president of the Scott Group.\"\nSo this was the Scott family's head? The one negotiating with Jerald?\nAndrew's arrogance grew, his chin practically in the air.\n\"So, Mr. Scott, you and Ms. Carter are still in touch?\"\nVictoria didn't deny it. William glanced at her, his tone slow and deliberate. \"Yes, we're quite close.\"\nThe implication was clear.\nA boss and his secretary, with a relationship that invited speculation.\nVictoria's face burned, and she glared at him, gritting her teeth.\nAndrew's displeasure was evident.\nVictoria's face and figure were irresistible to him, especially her full, perky chest, which seemed to captivate him completely.\nBut William's possessiveness was infuriating. How could he swallow this insult?",

        "content": "\"Mr. Scott, there are a few things in our agreement that I don't really get. Can you clear them up for me?\" Andrew asked, forcing a smile while fuming inside.\n\"Sure.\" William shot Victoria a look that left no room for argument. \"Wait for me over there.\"\nThe natural intimacy in his voice made anyone watching wonder about their relationship.\n\"Okay.\" Victoria obediently walked to a quieter spot.\nImmediately, the sharp-eyed crowd swarmed around her, pretending to make small talk while subtly probing her relationship with William.\nThose who initially wanted to cozy up to William now turned their attention to Victoria, hoping to gain an advantage through her.\nIn no time, a dozen business cards were thrust in front of her like a flurry of snowflakes.\nMeanwhile, William listened to Andrew's irrelevant and trivial questions, which didn't even touch on the core points of their cooperation. He grew increasingly impatient, not even bothering to make eye contact. Eventually, Harry stepped in to answer on his behalf.\nHolding his wine glass, William occasionally glanced in Victoria's direction.\nAt first, Victoria managed to handle the attention.\nBut as more people crowded around her, her brow furrowed, and a hint of helplessness appeared on her face.\nWilliam took a sip of his wine, thinking to himself that she shouldn't have been dragged into this complicated scene.\nSetting down his glass, he was about to walk over to her when Alice naturally sidled up to him.\nShe affectionately linked her arm with his, her demeanor intimate. \"This is Jonah Clarke, the head of this investment seminar and a key figure in Silvermist City's Department of Commerce.\"\nWilliam looked up to see a middle-aged man approaching them.\n\"You must be Mr. Scott. So young and accomplished! Alice, you have a good eye!\"\nThe man's compliment was laden with obvious implications.\nWilliam wasn't about to waste time explaining such trivial matters. His main goal for attending was to establish a connection with Jonah.\nHe hadn't expected Alice to have such a close relationship with him.\nHe glanced at her, realizing he knew less about her than he thought.\nSensing his thoughts, Alice leaned in and whispered, \"They only know me because of my aunt.\"\nWilliam knew a bit about Alice's aunt, Catherine Potts. His dealings in Xandria with Louie had gone smoothly partly due to Catherine's help.\nThe Potts family wasn't a major family, but Catherine had married far better than Alice's mother.\nHer husband was from the Bryant family, a prestigious family in Harborview City, comparable to the Scott family.\nThough Catherine hadn't married the head of the Bryant family, her husband was the head's younger brother, with significant assets and connections.\nCatherine and Alice's mother had been close since childhood, so it was natural for her to dote on Alice.\nRecently, Catherine had heard about Alice being trapped abroad by the Garcia family for years. If Ella hadn't donated a kidney to save Alice, Catherine wouldn't have let it go so easily.\nWilliam understood that if it was indeed Catherine's influence, it made sense.\nVictoria finally had some peace. She instinctively glanced over at William, who was now chatting and laughing with others, Alice clinging to him affectionately.\nAlice occasionally adjusted his slightly wrinkled collar with a natural familiarity.\nWho would believe they had broken up?\nVictoria forced herself to look away. Whether William and Alice rekindled their relationship was none of her business!\n\"Ms. Carter, Mr. Scott asked me to take you home.\" Harry appeared in front of her.\n\"The event isn't over yet,\" Victoria said.\n\"Mr. Scott said you might not be comfortable in this setting and shouldn't force yourself.\"\nVictoria turned her head, staring at William in a daze.\nWilliam was still mingling with the crowd, Alice clinging to him like a bird, and he didn't seem to mind at all!\n\"Why does he still care about what I do?\" Victoria slowly looked away, her tone carrying a hint of irritation she didn't even notice.\nBut as soon as she spoke, she realized it sounded like she was upset with a boyfriend or a girl complaining out of jealousy.\nRealizing this, her mood worsened, and her rebellious streak flared up. \"I'm not leaving! Why should I listen to him? I still need to promote my dad's company!\"\n\"But...\" Before Harry could say more, Victoria plunged into the bustling crowd.\nThis was an investment seminar, and everyone was deep in conversation. Victoria kept her task in mind.\nAs she promoted her company, people kept offering her drinks. Even though it was just wine, drinking one glass after another made her legs feel weak and her head light.\nHer cheeks grew redder, and as someone handed her another glass, a large, well-defined hand suddenly reached over, taking the glass and downing it in one gulp, then turning the empty glass upside down to show it was finished.\n\"Everyone, is it fun to bully a young lady? If you want to drink, I'll join you.\" With that, he calmly picked up another glass.\nVictoria tilted her head, looking at him in a daze. Perhaps it was the alcohol, but her head leaned against his chest, her consciousness growing fuzzier.\nSeeing this, the crowd awkwardly laughed, defusing the tension. Who would dare push Victoria to drink more?\nThis was William, after all!\nOf all people to offend, why him?\nWilliam glanced at Victoria, who was leaning against him, her cheeks flushed with a tipsy glow. Her body was limp, as if she might slide to the floor at any moment.\nWith a hint of exasperation, he wrapped an arm around her waist, supporting her entire weight.\nHe walked over to Jonah, his face apologetic, and said sincerely, \"I'm really sorry, but something came up. She's had a bit too much to drink, and I need to take her home.\"\nJonah was momentarily stunned, his gaze quickly sweeping over Victoria in William's arms, then glancing at Alice nearby. He smiled warmly, \"Of course, Mr. Scott. Take care of your business. We can talk another time.\"\n\"Absolutely.\"\nAlice's face turned sour. She had gone to great lengths to help him network, and now he was willing to forgo a significant business opportunity for Victoria!\nDespite her frustration and resentment, she suppressed her emotions, quickly catching up with them. She feigned concern, speaking softly, \"Ms. Carter had too much to drink? Maybe I should take her home. It's rare to have all the big names in Silvermist City here. Leaving now might not be the best idea.\"\n\"No need.\" William's refusal was firm, \"She's not that close to you.\"",

        "content": "He was just stating the obvious. After all, Victoria was completely wasted, and if she passed out on the street, could anyone else be as understanding as he was?\nHowever, Alice felt utterly humiliated by his words, and her smile turned increasingly bitter.\n\"Are you worried I can't take care of Ms. Carter? Seems like you really care about her. You never treated me like this when we were together. Forget it, I shouldn't have said anything.\"\nSeeing her look so hurt and disappointed, William hesitated slightly and softened his tone. \"I mean, you're not strong enough to handle someone who's drunk. It might be too much for you.\"\n\"Who says I'm drunk?\" Victoria, leaning on his shoulder, suddenly lifted her head and tried to open her eyes wide to prove she was perfectly sober.\nVictoria tried to focus on the people around her, but her mind was a mess.\nShe squinted and finally recognized Alice. Pointing a finger at her, she mumbled warily, \"I remember her. She's scary... She always scares me.\"\nWilliam raised an eyebrow slightly, his deep eyes narrowing as he slowly turned to look at Alice.\nAlice was stunned, then became furious, her voice rising. \"Ms. Carter! What nonsense are you talking about? When have I ever scared you? Just because you're drunk doesn't mean you can spout nonsense and cause trouble!\"\nVictoria let out a light hum. \"You had someone pull Lyanna's clothes in public just because she went to Harborview City with William.\"\n\"That's slander!\"\n\"And you said you'd skin me alive,\" Victoria continued.\n\"You!\"\nAlice was practically fuming. \"That's a complete lie! When did I ever say that?\"\n\"You did. You were so fierce! I know any woman who gets close to this guy ends up badly.\" Victoria's slender finger pointed at William's handsome face, poking it repeatedly. \"Now you know! I'm scared. I need to stay far away from you so I won't get stripped in the street.\"\nVictoria couldn't tell if this was reality or her imagination, but she poured out everything in her heart, mixing truth and lies.\nWilliam was silent for a moment, then thoughtfully said, \"So, you want to stay away from me because you're afraid someone will cause you trouble?\"\nAlice was on the verge of breaking down. \"William! You can't seriously believe her nonsense, can you?\"\nSuch childish and ridiculous accusations, like a kid tattling, and he believed it?\nWilliam lifted his deep eyes, looking at her with determination. \"She doesn't lie.\"\n\"You mean she doesn't lie, but I do?\" Alice stared at him in disbelief. \"In your eyes, I'm the kind of woman she says I am? Is that how you see me?\"\nVictoria felt the noise around her was overwhelming. She hiccuped and leaned against William's chest, frowning as she continued her accusations. \"You are! You are! Let me tell you, you can't do that again. You'll just scare all the men away, just like my mom, Nora.\"\n\"Shut up!\" Alice was trembling with anger, but considering the situation, she forced herself to lower her voice.\nBut her scolding of Victoria only made William more displeased. He suppressed his anger. \"She's not someone you can yell at.\"\nIt wasn't a warning, just a calm statement.\nHearing this, Victoria immediately grabbed his collar, pulling his head down to whisper in his ear, \"Don't provoke her. She might retaliate against you later!\"\nHe raised an eyebrow slightly, mimicking her, and whispered in her ear, \"She wouldn't dare.\"\n\"Okay.\" Victoria nodded as if she understood, looking like she had learned a lesson.\nThey were so wrapped up in each other that they completely ignored Alice!\nAlice knew William was just placating Victoria and might not truly believe what she said.\nBut he didn't care about her feelings at all!\n\"I'm leaving. Harry will take you home later.\" William said this indifferently, then helped Victoria into the car, got in himself, started the engine, and drove away.\nAlice stood there in a daze, watching the car disappear into the distance, her heart feeling like it was being torn apart. \nThe black Rolls-Royce drove steadily down the road.\nVictoria was half-lying in the seat, her beautiful face flushed with a dreamy red, clearly still drunk.\nShe rubbed her forehead, her eyes hazy as she looked out the window, mumbling, \"So thirsty, so hot.\"\nWilliam remembered the last time in the rental apartment when she was just as enticingly drunk.\nHe couldn't help but swallow, feeling all the blood in his body rushing to one place, a wave of heat rising from his lower abdomen.\nHis breathing became a bit erratic, his deep eyes growing darker and more intense. He pressed his lips together and pulled over onto a side road.\nHe took a blanket from the back seat and covered her, then opened a bottle of water and brought it to her lips.\nVictoria instinctively tilted her head back and drank a few gulps, but she drank too quickly and started coughing, tears welling up in her eyes.\nWilliam sighed helplessly, pulling her into his arms and patting her back firmly.\nVictoria finally stopped coughing, her small face buried in his chest, gasping for breath.\nThe spilled water soaked a large part of the fabric on her chest, faintly revealing her nipples.\nVictoria blinked her clear, watery eyes, looking up at him in a daze.\nWilliam's heart raced as he looked at her luscious red lips.\nHe couldn't hold back any longer and leaned down to kiss her lips.\nThe soft, warm sensation made Victoria instinctively close her eyes, letting his tongue pry open her teeth and ravage her sweet mouth.\nThe smell of alcohol mixed with her unique scent lingered in his nose, making him lose himself.\nVictoria let out a soft moan, instinctively wrapping her arms around his waist, responding to his kiss.\nHer reaction made William even more excited. He tightened his arms around her, wanting to merge with her completely, never to be separated.\nVictoria felt dizzy, her body growing weaker, her arms clinging to his neck.\nHis lips touched her warm skin, igniting a fire wherever they met. Victoria's body trembled more violently, holding him tightly, her waist writhing restlessly.\nBut this contact only made her crave more, the primal desire almost pulling her into an abyss.\nWilliam also noticed her increasingly urgent movements. His large hand reached down between them, feeling her soaking wet panties.\nWilliam took a deep breath, turned her over to lie on the seat back, and removed her panties, looking at the fluid between her legs. His throat tightened, and he swallowed hard.",

        "content": "He had already touched her intimately, and only then did a flicker of conscience arise within him. Was he taking advantage of Victoria? If she woke up, would she never speak to him again?\nBut then he thought that it wasn't the first time he had taken advantage of her.\nWithout the influence of alcohol, she wouldn't even want to be near him.\nHe took off his shirt, revealing a well-toned chest with defined muscles.\nVictoria, already lost to the effects of alcohol, acted purely on instinct, seeking any form of relief.\nWilliam was losing control under her touch.\nHe hesitated, even pulling his hand back, but Victoria grew more desperate, moving her hips to press against him.\nHis tip brushed against her inner thigh, grazing her sensitive areas, almost slipping inside.\nHer body pressed tightly against the seat, and William's hand found its way to her soft breast, gently kneading it. She moaned involuntarily, her small hands gripping his broad shoulders.\nUnable to hold back any longer, William thrust into her, aided by the natural lubrication.\nHis thick member plunged deep into Victoria, reaching her core.\nHe hadn't expected her to climax so quickly, her body convulsing around him.\nShe was so sensitive today.\nWilliam held her close, their bodies tightly joined. Before he could move, Victoria's hips began to grind, urging him to thrust inside her.\nDriven to the brink, William gripped her hips, matching her movements with deep, powerful thrusts.\nVictoria's moans filled the confined space, her breath coming in gasps as she clung to him, drawing endless pleasure from their union.\nThe car was too cramped, and William worried she might get hurt from their intense activity. He tried to control his strength, veins bulging in his arms, sweat forming on his forehead.\nFluids flowed from her, wetting their joined bodies, the rhythmic sound of their flesh meeting echoing in the small space.\nVictoria's body rose and fell, clinging to him, crying out in pleasure.\nTears of ecstasy streamed down her cheeks. William, breathing heavily, leaned in to kiss her, their lips and tongues entwining.\nAfter two more climaxes, William finally released inside her, sighing in satisfaction as he held her close.\nThe car was filled with a heady atmosphere. Victoria had fallen asleep from exhaustion. William watched her for a while, then gently cleaned her up.\nHe wanted to dress her, but her dress was soaked with various fluids.\nHe had no choice but to cover her with his coat.\nThe car's heater was on, and she slept soundly, not even a frown on her face.\nWilliam looked at Victoria, feeling a surge of happiness. He couldn't resist kissing her lips lightly before starting the car and driving away.\nThe car came to a sudden stop.\nVictoria, sleeping in the reclined passenger seat, lost her balance and almost fell forward. A strong hand quickly reached out, steadying her and setting her upright.\nVictoria groggily opened her eyes, confusion evident in her gaze. \"Where are we?\"\n\"My office,\" William replied curtly, stepping out of the car first.\nVictoria, still disoriented, realized they were at the Scott Group. How did she end up here?\nShe hurriedly got out, her head still spinning, the alcohol not fully worn off, and her clothes not properly worn.\nVictoria thought it might be her imagination.\n\"Thanks for earlier. I won't bother you at work. I'll just call a cab home,\" she said.\nWilliam's eyes swept over her, a hint of amusement in his gaze. \"How are you going to get home? Wearing my coat? Sure, I don't mind. Let's see how you explain it.\"\nClothes?\nVictoria instinctively looked down and realized she was wearing William's coat! He was only in a thin suit jacket, standing tall in the cold wind.\nThen she realized something else, hurriedly peeking inside the coat. Her cheeks flushed red-she was only in her underwear!\nVictoria quickly pulled the coat tighter, her voice rising. \"What happened?\"\nWilliam's expression was slightly awkward. \"You threw up all over yourself.\"\nVictoria's head was foggy, her memory patchy. \"Who helped me change?\"\nWilliam feigned ignorance, quickly walking past her to the company entrance. \"Do you want to come in?\"\nVictoria was in a tough spot, feeling extremely awkward. \"I can go buy some clothes nearby.\"\nWilliam took a deep breath, seemingly suppressing something. He strode over, grabbing her arm and pulling her towards the building.\n\"William! Let go!\"\nIt wasn't quitting time yet, and Victoria knew struggling would draw attention and possibly lead to rumors. She had to endure, trying to keep some distance, but her feet followed him involuntarily.\nThe more cautious she was, the darker William's expression became.\nThey entered the elevator, the air thick with awkwardness.\nWilliam spoke first. \"I'll have someone bring clothes. You can wait in my office.\"\n\"No need. I can wait in the conference room.\"\nHe raised an eyebrow, a hint of a smile in his eyes. \"If you're innocent, why hide our relationship? Unless you're guilty, have you always had feelings for me?\"\n\"You're overthinking it.\" Victoria turned away. She could stay calm with anyone but him.\nAfter a moment, he asked, \"Has Alice given you trouble?\"\n\"No!\" Victoria's denial was quick and unconvincing.\nAlice was ruthless, willing to do anything to achieve her goals. Victoria had seen it firsthand at the bar, where Alice had framed her for drug dealing. What wouldn't she do?\nWilliam said no more. When the elevator doors opened, he walked out.\nVictoria followed, still wearing his coat, her head low.\nWilliam glanced at her, mocking. \"Victoria, are you feeling guilty?\"\nShe snapped back, \"Why would I be guilty?\"\n\"Then hold your head up. Even if something happened between us, it's nothing to be ashamed of. No need to carry such a heavy burden. Everyone's busy; no one will watch your every move.\"\nVictoria was taken aback, staring at William's back.\nBut somehow, she straightened her spine and lifted her head.\nHe was right. Fear came from guilt. What did she have to be guilty about?\nWilliam's office was spacious and stylish, with a minimalist yet tasteful design. Victoria sat obediently on the sofa, waiting.\nHis new secretary, a man, came in to report. Then managers followed, either getting scolded or receiving instructions.\nWilliam's new secretary replaced Lyanna, who had left after Alice publicly humiliated her.\nVictoria remembered six months ago, she was one of those getting scolded.",

        "content": "William was ruthless at work, his words sharp and cutting.\nVictoria hesitated to interrupt, so she pulled out her phone, thinking she'd call a courier to bring her a change of clothes from home.\nBut just as she opened her phone, William's secretary walked in with a set of clothes.\n\"Mr. Scott, here are the clothes you requested.\"\nWilliam glanced up and nodded towards Victoria, and the secretary handed the clothes to her.\n\"That was fast,\" Victoria said, surprised.\nShe thought he might have done it on purpose and felt a bit embarrassed by her assumption.\nWhen she looked up, she met William's gaze. He squinted at first, then seemed to understand everything, a slight smile playing on his lips.\nBlushing, Victoria quickly took the clothes and headed to the small adjoining room in the office.\nThe room was still spacious and tidy, reminding her of the time she came here to resign and ended up making love with him.\nThe more she thought about it, the more she blushed. She hurriedly took off her coat, but in her haste, she caught her hair in the zipper of her dress.\nShe gasped in pain. Without a mirror, she fumbled to free her hair, only making it worse and pulling out a few strands.\nFrustrated, she stomped her foot.\nJust then, there was a knock at the door, a light tap before William pushed it open.\n\"Don't come in!\" Victoria cried.\nHer dress was half-zipped, her chest barely covered. She turned her back to him, exposing her tangled hair.\nSeeing the situation, William raised an eyebrow and walked over. \"Why didn't you ask for help?\"\n\"I can do it myself.\"\n\"Don't move.\" William's hand gently brushed her back, his fingers grazing her skin. He knew how delicate her skin was.\nHe slowly and carefully freed her hair. Victoria stood still, feeling the tenderness in his touch.\nHer heart raced, her cheeks flushed. William was special to her, after all.\nHe was her first love, and they had shared the most intimate moments. She remembered his every little preference.\nSince Alvin intervened, she had drawn a clear line between them, and William hadn't pushed.\nBut some memories were etched deep. A glance, a touch, could bring back those heart-pounding moments.\nFeeling the tension in her scalp release, she quickly asked, \"Is it free?\"\n\"Yes,\" William replied in a low voice. \"As a thank you\"\nHe leaned in and kissed her back, warm and gentle.\nVictoria froze, feeling like she'd been shocked. She turned sharply, pressing her back against the wall. \"William, what are you doing?\"\nWilliam's gaze was intense and heated. Without explaining, he stepped forward, wrapping an arm around her waist.\nHer waist was slender, and he felt an urge to tighten his grip, a desire to control that he found intoxicating.\nVictoria knew this side of him well. She grabbed his hand, trying to pull it away. \"William, we're not together anymore. You can't do this.\"\n\"Not together?\" William's eyes darkened, a bitter smile on his lips. \"Then let's make something happen, and we will be.\"\nHe cupped her neck and kissed her hard.\nThe last two times, she had been drunk, which had its own thrill, but it wasn't her true reaction.\nVictoria's mind went blank, overwhelmed by his scent, dominant and invasive.\nHer heart pounded, her chest filled with a rush of emotions.\nWilliam seemed to have waited for this. One hand pressed against her back, pulling her close.\nHe knew her body as well as she knew his, aware of every breath, knowing how to make her melt.\nFeeling the cool air on her skin, Victoria snapped back to reality. She pushed his hand away, stopping him from going further.\nWilliam pulled back, eyes narrowed. \"You feel it too.\"\nVictoria didn't deny it, but that made her feel even more ashamed.\n\"We shouldn't be doing this,\" she said, trying to stay calm. She pushed against his chest. \"We're adults, not kids. This doesn't mean anything.\"\nBut what she refused to admit was exactly what he cared about.\nWilliam didn't let go, gripping her chin. \"So with another man, you'll also feel aroused? Is that what you mean?\"\n\"You too,\" Victoria shot back, meeting his gaze without flinching. \"Don't tell me I'm the only woman you've been with.\"\nWilliam's eyes darkened further.\n\"Even if you say that, I won't believe it.\"\nWithout her, he had Alice. They were practically engaged. No one would believe they hadn't done anything.\nWilliam took a deep breath, a bitter smile on his lips. \"How much do you think you know me?\"\n\"What about Alice? Did you say the same to her?\"\nWilliam's brow furrowed slightly.\nCoincidentally, his phone rang urgently.\nWilliam pressed his lips together, turned, and walked out to take the call.\nVictoria took the chance to calm herself, quickly getting dressed and fixing her hair before following him out.\n\"Alice? Where are you? I'll be right there!\"\nThe call was clearly from Alice. He looked worried, like it was an emergency.\nGrabbing his coat and keys, he strode out, pausing briefly to say, \"I'll have someone else take you home.\"\nThen he left without looking back.\nVictoria stood there, a self-mocking smile on her lips.\n'Victoria, what are you expecting? You know this is impossible,' she thought to herself bitterly.\nAs she stepped out of the Scott Group building, her phone rang. It was the hospital.\n\"Dr. Myers?\"",

        "content": "Victoria arrived at the hospital in no time, as it wasn't far from her place.\nDr. Tony Myers was already waiting in the hallway. Seeing her rush in, he immediately approached her. \"Ms. Carter, your mom's condition is pretty serious.\"\nVictoria listened to Tony's explanation, her brows furrowed tightly the entire time.\n\"You're her only designated guardian. We need your consent for the next steps in her treatment.\"\nTony glanced at her before continuing, \"Her body's been showing warning signs for a while now. The hospital didn't recommend her discharge in the first place. Right now, we need to prepare for a transplant surgery.\"\nVictoria suddenly asked, \"What about Bobby? Did he come with her?\"\n\"He did. But after dropping Nora off at the hospital, he disappeared. The nurses have been trying to reach him, but no luck so far.\"\n\"Dr. Myers, I understand. Please go ahead with your plan.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nVictoria turned and walked into the hospital room.\nIt hadn't been long, but Nora had become so emaciated that her features were distorted. Her cheekbones jutted out, making her look like a frail old woman. Her lips were pale and bloodless.\nNora glanced at her and let out a cold laugh, which quickly turned into a violent cough.\nVictoria watched her expressionlessly and silently poured her a glass of water.\nNora's voice was hoarse as she asked, \"Was it you who posted the video online, making us a laughingstock? Are you proud of yourself?\"\nVictoria remained silent. She had indeed posted the video. At the time, she was so furious that she just wanted to teach them a lesson.\nNora continued, \"You're a worthless piece of trash. I should have killed you the moment you were born, saved myself the trouble. Letting you live is my biggest regret!\"\nVictoria had heard such words so many times that she was numb to them. She calmly picked up a wet wipe and gently cleaned the spittle from the corner of Nora's mouth.\nBut Nora wasn't grateful. She even tried to bite Victoria's hand.\nVictoria pulled her hand back and looked at her coldly. \"Dr. Myers said they'll arrange your surgery soon.\"\n\"What surgery?\" Nora's eyes widened, her expression not of joy but of suspicion.\n\"A transplant surgery.\"\nNora blurted out, \"You've come around? You're willing to donate your kidney to me?\"\nThere was a hint of hope in her voice.\nVictoria lowered her eyes and let out a soft laugh. \"How could it be me? Why would I take away Bobby's chance for medical parole?\"\nNora's face changed dramatically. \"No! It can't be Bobby! Bobby is absolutely out of the question!\"\nVictoria slowly closed her eyes. When she opened them again, they were sharp and piercing as she stared at Nora. \"He can't, but I can? What's the logic in that?\"\nNora struggled to sit up in bed, but she was too weak to support herself. \"Bobby has nothing now! If he loses his health, how will he survive?\"\n\"And what about me?\" At that moment, all of Victoria's long-suppressed emotions burst forth like a flood.\nShe pointed at herself, tears welling up in her eyes. \"Don't I need a healthy body? Don't I deserve to live well? I'm your daughter. Why have you never seen me? If you only gave birth to me to abandon me, why didn't you just kill me as a baby? Do you think I would be grateful to you today? No! Never! I only hate you!\"\n\"What right do you have to hate me? You shouldn't have been born in the first place. If the doctor hadn't said that an abortion was risky, do you think I would have wanted to have you?\" Nora snapped.\nNora's words once again made Victoria see through her so-called \"motherly love.\"\nThere was no turning back now. What more was there to say?\nVictoria nodded slightly, her tone firm and resolute. \"Since this mother-daughter relationship disgusts you so much, let's stop torturing each other from now on. I won't take care of your affairs anymore. And I hope you won't interfere in my life either.\"\n\"In your dreams!\" Nora sneered, her face twisted with rage. She propped herself up with one hand, struggling to sit up. \"As long as I have a breath left, you won't get rid of me! I'm your mother. No matter what I've done, you have to take care of me! Otherwise, I'll make your life a living hell!\"\nShe laughed maniacally, but her laughter was cut short by a violent cough. She glared at Victoria with bloodshot eyes. \"I'm disgraced because of you, you wretch! What do I have left to lose? Victoria, mark my words, I will never let you go! Even if I die and become a ghost, I'll haunt you forever!\"\nVictoria lowered her gaze, unwilling to look at that twisted face any longer.\n\"Maybe you don't know me well enough.\" She slowly stood up and looked at Nora with cold, calm eyes. \"Dad is the only person I care about in this world. For him, I would do anything. As for you, you're nothing to me. I won't be threatened by you.\"\n\"Not take care of me? Aren't you afraid of being scorned by everyone, of being fired from the gallery?\" Nora screamed. \nIn the past, this would have been Victoria's weak spot. Starry Studio Gallery was her last lifeline when she had nowhere else to turn, her spiritual support.\nBut now, Victoria lowered her eyes and chuckled softly. \"Fine, then I'll just become an independent artist. It would be more freeing, and the income wouldn't be bad either.\"\n\"What makes you think you can be an artist? After what you did to Bobby, you still want to be an artist?\"\n\"Did you forget who painted those award-winning pieces? If someone like him can make it, why can't I?\" Victoria said, curling one side of her lips in disdain. \"Don't think of the art world as your backyard. Not only will I enter it, but I'll also become famous! You'll only be able to look at my works in envy and jealousy!\"\nNora was utterly disgusted by her pursuit of art. \"Do you have that kind of talent? Do you think anyone can become famous?\"\n\"If Bobby can, then the bar must be pretty low.\" Victoria knew exactly how to hurt her, so she smiled and said, \"Everything you've ever wanted, I'll hold in my hands!\"\n\"You're delusional!\" Nora was so enraged that her chest heaved violently, her face turning pale, her eyes filled with venom.\nVictoria turned and walked towards the door. When she reached it, she paused and looked back, speaking slowly, \"You should contact Bobby soon. Since there's a surgery to be done, all pre-op checks are crucial and must be taken seriously.\"\nShe smiled slightly and walked out the door.\n\"Come back! Get back here!\" Nora was furious and tried to get out of bed to chase her, but as soon as she swung one leg over the edge, she collapsed to the floor.\nVictoria didn't pause for a moment.\nNora lay on the floor, fists clenched, pounding the ground in a fit of rage. \"Bobby can't! He can't donate! Do you hear me? Do you hear me?\"\nThe door had already closed. Victoria walked down the hallway, hearing the curses from the room behind her, a bitter smile of self-mockery on her lips.\nShe had always favored Bobby, from childhood to adulthood, it only got worse!\nShe could force Victoria to donate her kidney to save her, but she would rather die than use Bobby's kidney!",

        "content": "In the hospital lobby, Victoria sat on a bench, staring blankly at the people coming and going through the entrance.\nShe had been sitting there for quite a while, feeling utterly exhausted.\nNora had always treated her this way, ever since she could remember. Now that she was older, there was no need to feel hurt by such coldness anymore.\nAt this moment, it was Nora and Bobby who should be in a panic, not her.\nAfter coming to this realization, she slowly stood up and walked to the vending machine to buy a cup of hot coffee.\nJust as she took the cup, someone bumped into her from behind, causing the coffee to spill on her chest, making her wince from the heat.\nShe frowned and looked up to see a middle-aged woman in her forties or fifties, dressed extravagantly, with an arrogant demeanor.\nEven though the woman knew she had bumped into someone, she only glanced at Victoria indifferently, without any intention of apologizing.\n\"Excuse me, ma'am, you...\" Victoria froze when she saw the person behind the woman. \"Wendy?\"\nWendy was hiding behind her mother, Carol Clark. She had recognized Victoria but deliberately avoided her gaze, pulling her scarf up to cover most of her face.\nVictoria's heart tightened, and she vaguely guessed the woman's identity. Her expression turned cold as she asked softly, \"Wendy, why are you at the hospital? Are you feeling unwell?\"\nCarol glanced at Victoria arrogantly and asked Wendy with a frown, \"Do you know her?\"\n\"Just a colleague, not very close.\" Wendy was eager to distance herself from Victoria in front of Carol.\nVictoria frowned, full of doubts, but she could see Wendy's reluctance and knew she had her reasons, so she didn't press further.\nAfter nodding slightly to the two of them, she threw the paper cup into the trash, bought another cup of coffee, and returned to her seat. She took out a tissue to wipe the coffee stains from her chest.\nCarol watched Victoria's departing figure suspiciously and muttered to herself, \"Have I seen her somewhere before?\"\n\"She's my colleague. Maybe you've seen a photo or something.\" Wendy tried her best to conceal Victoria's true identity.\n\"Is that all?\" Carol's brow furrowed. Hearing the nurse call her, she took Wendy into the examination room.\nBefore entering, she gently patted Wendy's head and forced a smile. \"Wendy, you're grown up now. You know what to say and what not to say, right?\"\nWendy bit her lip and nodded.\nShe turned around, dragging her heavy steps, filled with exhaustion and helplessness.\nThis was just a chance encounter. Victoria understood that Wendy didn't want to share her family matters and didn't intend to pry, thinking that Wendy would speak up when she was ready.\nBut who could have predicted that the next day, when Victoria received a call from Diana, she would be filled with regret.\nWhen Victoria rushed to the hospital, Diana was already in the room.\nWendy lay on the bed, her hair disheveled, her face bruised and swollen, her body covered in bruises, clearly having been severely beaten.\nVictoria walked up, looking at her pale face, her nose stinging with emotion. \"What happened? How did you end up like this?\"\nDiana whispered, \"The police called me early this morning. They found her unconscious on the street. They couldn't reach her family, so they called me. The doctor said she has multiple fractures and many old injuries.\"\nDiana sighed softly. \"She woke up briefly. I asked if she wanted to call the police, but she refused. She said she was afraid...\"\nVictoria felt a pang of sorrow. \"Afraid of what?\"\n\"Afraid her mom would get into trouble.\" Diana hesitated. \"From the way she talked, it seemed like her mom was the one who beat her because her dad wants a divorce, and she took it out on Wendy.\"\nVictoria's heart was a whirlwind of emotions, and her eyes reddened.\nSome mothers were truly mothers, but some were demons to their children.\nVictoria silently examined Wendy's injuries, new wounds layered over old ones.\nThere was a faint scar on her head, already healed. If her hair hadn't been such a mess, it would have been hard to notice. It looked like it had been caused by a hard object.\nThey couldn't imagine what Wendy had endured over the years.\nVictoria was both angry and heartbroken. She decisively said, \"I'm calling the police!\"\nAt that moment, a weak hand tugged at Victoria's sleeve, pulling feebly. \"Victoria, don't call the police.\"\nVictoria looked down at Wendy, her gaze firm. \"If we don't call the police, are we just going to let her keep torturing you? This time you were lucky to be brought to the hospital. What about next time? And the time after that? She may have given you life, but that doesn't give her the right to abuse you!\"\nDiana also tried to persuade her. \"Don't you see? She doesn't see you as her daughter at all.\"\nJust then, the door opened, and Carol walked in.\nThe moment she saw her, Victoria could feel Wendy's body tense up.\nWendy instinctively lowered her head, gripping Victoria's hand tightly.\nIn front of others, Carol appeared extremely gentle. Seeing them, she immediately asked with concern, \"Are you Wendy's colleagues? Thank you for coming to see her.\"\nVictoria asked directly, \"What happened to Wendy's injuries?\"\n\"It breaks my heart to talk about it. I've been sick these past few days, feeling out of it. Wendy insisted on helping with the housework. She's clumsy and accidentally knocked over a hot water bottle, burning herself, and then tripped and fell several times, getting these injuries. I'm heartbroken too.\"\nCarol's eyes reddened as she spoke, her voice choked with emotion, as if she were the one who had suffered.\nWendy turned her head away in embarrassment, burying her face deep in the blanket.\nDiana couldn't stand it anymore and said angrily, \"Mrs. Clark, Wendy has always been a smart and capable employee at work, never giving me any trouble. How could she be so clumsy at home? Do you really think anyone would believe your story?\"\nCarol was momentarily stunned, seemingly never having heard anyone speak up for Wendy.\nHer facade of gentle kindness shattered, and she screamed hysterically at Wendy on the bed, \"If she were so smart, why couldn't she help me win her father's favor? Now her father wants to divorce me and live with his mistress and illegitimate child. Isn't that her fault?\"\nWendy cried silently under the blanket, her tears soaking the pillow, but she didn't dare to say a word in protest.\nVictoria trembled with anger, glaring at Carol. \"So you beat her and abused her to make your husband change his mind?\"\n'Why are some mothers so cruel, taking out their marital frustrations on their children?' Victoria wondered.\nIt was clearly her own problem, her own shortcomings. How could she make an innocent child suffer?\n\"Miss, don't say such things.\" Carol looked at Victoria, her tone as gentle as a spring breeze. \"You're still young and don't understand the difficulties of being a parent. Besides, disciplining my child is our family matter.\"\nWith that, she walked to the bed, elegantly lifting a corner of the blanket, her face showing a seemingly concerned smile. \"Wendy, tell your colleagues to go home. You need to rest and not waste their time.\"\nWendy looked at Carol with helpless eyes, instinctively shrinking back into the bed, her voice choked with tears. \"You all, you all should go. I'm fine.\"\nCarol's lips curled into a barely noticeable smile, and she politely said, \"I'm sorry, my daughter needs to rest now. Please, everyone, leave.\"",

        "content": "Carol was already trying to shoo Victoria and Diana away, and with Wendy worried about Carol's depression, even if they wanted to stand up for her, it would be pointless if she didn't cooperate.\nAs they walked out of the hospital room, Diana grew increasingly frustrated, gritting her teeth. \"Hasn't she had enough of this misery? We're clearly trying to help her, can't she just be strong for once?\"\nVictoria was in a foul mood too. Seeing Wendy's condition made her think of herself.\nAlthough Nora hadn't physically abused her when she was young, the long-term mental torment and suffocating oppression had nearly driven her to the brink of collapse. If Alvin hadn't come back, she might not have escaped the fate of being forced to sacrifice by Nora.\nIn comparison, how much better off was she really?\nJust then, Diana spoke up, \"Victoria, look over there. Isn't that Samuel?\"\nVictoria followed her gaze and saw Samuel, indeed. He was talking to a doctor, looking focused and serious.\nIn the few days since she last saw him, he seemed to have lost weight, with a faint stubble on his chin and a tired look on his face.\nAfter the doctor gave some instructions and left, Samuel turned around and his eyes met Victoria's. He paused for a moment before walking over to her.\n\"Victoria, what are you doing here?\" Samuel's voice was hoarse and low, filled with obvious fatigue.\n\"Wendy's in the hospital. I came to see her. What about you?\"\n\"It's my dad.\" His voice carried a hint of bitterness, and he forced a wry smile. \"He's pretty sick.\"\nVictoria was taken aback and quickly asked, \"What did the doctor say?\"\n\"We've contacted a specialist team from Harborview City. The surgery is scheduled for next month.\"\nDiana, sensing the need for privacy, quietly stepped back to give Victoria and Samuel some space.\nVictoria was shocked by the news. No wonder Samuel had been out of touch these past few days-this was what had been going on!\nA deep sense of guilt welled up inside her. As his girlfriend, she hadn't been there for him during such a critical time. \"Samuel, I...\"\n\"Samuel!\"\nA clear voice called out from the other end of the hallway. It was Hannah.\nShe waved at him with a bright smile. \"Mr. Brown is looking for you.\"\nSamuel's expression changed instantly. He looked at Victoria first, hurriedly explaining, \"I didn't ask her to come.\"\nSeeing Hannah, Victoria understood a bit more. She nodded. \"I get it.\"\nShe continued, \"Mr. and Mrs. Brown both like her. With her here, you can be more at ease.\"\nSamuel should have been pleased with Victoria's understanding, but his feelings were complicated. A subtle, indescribable sense of loss crept into his heart.\nHe had already taken leave from school, managing the company for Elmer while also taking care of him at the hospital. He was utterly exhausted, with no energy left for sadness.\nVictoria spoke softly, \"With Ms. Wright here, I won't go visit your father now. Call me when the time is right.\"\nShe didn't want Samuel to be caught between her and his parents.\nSamuel gazed at her for a moment, then slowly looked away and nodded. \"I'll head back now. I'll contact you later.\"\n\"Samuel.\" Victoria called out to him, biting her lip with an apologetic look. \"I'm sorry I didn't know until now.\"\nHe shook his head with a bitter smile. \"How could this be your fault? It just happened recently.\"\nHe raised his hand as if to touch her cheek but stopped midway and slowly lowered it. \"You have your entrance exams in two weeks. I might not be able to be there with you.\"\n\"It's okay. I'm confident. Just take care of Mr. Brown.\"\nShe had been spending all her time outside of work studying. With her strong foundation and Samuel's previous tutoring, she was well-prepared for the exams.\nShe didn't want to burden him with her issues. He had enough on his plate.\nSamuel looked at her silently for a long time before sighing. \"Alright, I'll go now.\"\n\"Okay.\" Watching him walk away, Victoria felt a pang of heartache.\nHe seemed to have lost a lot of weight. The once confident and spirited Samuel now looked so worn and defeated.\nA bad feeling rose in Victoria's heart. She felt that the distance between her and Samuel was growing.\nHer brows furrowed with a hint of worry.\nDiana came over and patted her shoulder. \"Victoria, don't overthink it. I heard from a friend that Elmer's been unwell for a long time. He delayed going to the hospital, and now it's serious. Samuel must feel really guilty for not taking better care of him.\"\nVictoria nodded. \"I understand.\"\nSeeing that Victoria was preoccupied, Diana didn't press the matter further.\nThe next day, at dawn, Victoria hurried to the hospital.\nShe went straight upstairs to find Tony and ask about Nora's condition.\nDespite her deep-seated resentment towards Nora, as a daughter, she couldn't completely abandon her.\nTony informed her that Nora was stalling, neither agreeing to the surgery nor clearly refusing it.\nBut her health was deteriorating, and she couldn't afford to delay much longer. The hospital had no choice but to ask Victoria to try and persuade her.\n\"Let her be,\" Victoria said, surprisingly calm. \"She doesn't want Bobby to lose his health because of her. But Bobby's Medical Parole was granted for the transplant surgery. If he doesn't get it, he'll be sent back to prison. That's why she's stuck. If I were the donor, I'd probably be on the operating table by now.\"\nTony sighed helplessly. For now, they could only wait. \"I'll try to contact Bobby and have him talk to her.\"\nVictoria didn't say much more. Asking someone to give up their health for another was a form of moral coercion, even among family.\nSo, whatever Nora and Bobby decided was their business.\nThe she went to visit Wendy's room, only to be told by a nurse that Wendy had already been discharged.\nVictoria felt a surge of anxiety and quickly took out her phone to call Wendy.\n\"This line is currently busy. Please try your call again shortly.\"\nVictoria's heart raced. She tried again, but it was still busy.\nShe called Diana, asking her to find a way to contact Wendy.\nAfter making those arrangements, she headed to Elmer's room.\nShe knocked gently, and after a moment, the door opened to reveal Hannah.\nHannah's eyes flickered as she looked Victoria up and down. A woman as striking as Victoria was hard to forget, especially since she was the girlfriend of the man Hannah admired.\nVictoria hadn't expected her to be there. After a brief pause, she nodded slightly and said softly, \"I'm here to see Mr. Brown.\"",

        "content": "Hannah's lips curved into a friendly smile. \"Ms. Carter. Come on in.\"\nThe hospital room was a spacious, luxurious suite. As soon as Victoria stepped inside, she saw Primrose sitting by the bed, carefully wiping Elmer's hands.\nElmer looked up, surprised to see her. \"Victoria?\"\nVictoria gently placed the fruit basket and flowers on the nearby table. Primrose, always polite and courteous, warmly invited her to sit and chat.\nHannah quickly poured a glass of water and brought it to her. \"Ms. Carter, have some water.\"\n\"Thanks.\"\nElmer's face lit up with affection. \"Hannah, you don't need to keep busy. Sit down and rest for a bit. You've been such a help these past few days, Primrose and I are very grateful.\"\n\"Mr. Brown, you're too formal. Samuel's busy with work, so it's my duty to take care of you.\"\nVictoria sat quietly, her expression calm and unreadable.\nAfter a while, the doctor came in for a check-up. Seeing this, Victoria quickly stood up to leave. Primrose also stood up. \"Victoria, let me walk you out.\"\nVictoria nodded, understanding that Primrose had something to say in private.\nIn the hallway, Primrose sighed softly, her eyes slightly red. \"The doctor said that at his age, the surgery is very risky. We need to be prepared for the worst.\"\nShe looked at Victoria with earnest eyes. \"Victoria, you know I've always stayed neutral about you and Samuel dating. But now, I have to ask you to let go.\"\nVictoria leaned against the wall, wanting to say something, but her throat felt tight, and she couldn't get a word out.\n\"You saw it yourself. Hannah is a good girl. Not only in the family, but she can also be a great help to Samuel in his career. Samuel, being an artist, has never run a company. If something happens to his father, he needs someone reliable by his side.\"\nVictoria listened silently, knowing that Primrose was right.\n\"I can see that Samuel likes you, but he's a filial son. He's caught between you and his father, and it's tearing him apart. So, Victoria, I'm asking you to break up with him to ease his burden.\"\nPrimrose didn't press her for an immediate decision. She turned and went back into the room.\nVictoria slowly turned around, her head down, lost in thought.\n\"Are you really going to agree to such a self-sacrificing request?\" A familiar voice, full of doubt and sarcasm, broke the silence.\nVictoria frowned slightly and turned to see William's cold eyes.\nWilliam stood a few steps away, hands in his pockets, looking at her with a mix of mockery and challenge. \"You only dare to act tough in front of me. With anyone else, you shrink back.\"\nVictoria was in a mix of shame and anger.\nShe didn't understand why she always cared so much about her dignity in front of William, not willing to lose even a bit of it.\nBefore she could ask why William was there, Alice gracefully walked out of the room next door. \"William.\"\nWilliam slowly shifted his gaze from Victoria to Alice. \"Did the test results come back?\"\n\"The doctor said my immune system's a bit weak, so I need to take it easy for a while.\" Alice glanced at Victoria, a quick flash of disdain in her eyes before she smiled. \"What a coincidence, running into Ms. Carter everywhere.\"\nThough she spoke in a joking tone, her words implied that Victoria was following them on purpose.\nVictoria was exhausted, both physically and mentally, from dealing with Nora, Wendy, and the Brown family. She had no time to follow these two around.\nBut she didn't bother to explain. Alice had never given up on William and saw every woman as a rival.\n\"I won't keep you. I'll be going now.\"\n\"I'll walk you out,\" William suddenly said.\n\"No need. It's out of your way.\"\n\"How would you know if it's out of my way?\"\nHis words carried a hint of sarcasm, making Victoria's heart tighten.\nVictoria pressed her lips together and started to walk away.\nBut William didn't give her a chance. With a few long strides, he grabbed her arm and pulled her into the elevator.\nAlice clutched her test results, her face turning pale with anger. She glared at Victoria before following them into the elevator.\n\"William, just talk nicely to Ms. Carter.\"\nWilliam's expression grew colder. \"Would she listen if I talked nicely?\"\nVictoria glared at him, trying to shake off his hand. Just as she was about to retort, more people crowded into the elevator, pushing Alice to the other side. Someone even wheeled in a patient, filling the space completely.\nVictoria swallowed her words, turning her back to William, trying to make herself as small as possible.\nWilliam stood close, their proximity too intimate. Her body pressed against his, making her heart race and her mind flustered. She leaned against the cold elevator wall, desperately trying to create some distance.\nEspecially when she caught Alice's jealous glare, she felt a chill down her spine.\nWilliam's warm breath tickled her ear, making her shiver.\nVictoria cursed him silently, feeling her ears burn.\nSeeing her trying so hard to distance herself, William's eyes darkened. His chest felt tight with frustration.\nHe let out a cold laugh and leaned in closer, trapping her in the corner, unable to move.\nVictoria's heart pounded.\nWhat was wrong with William? Why did he always take advantage of her?\nShe was furious but helpless, pushing against his chest.\nWilliam didn't budge, standing firm.\nHe raised an eyebrow, his eyes full of challenge, as if to say, \"What can you do about it?\"\nVictoria struggled, feeling the elevator descend painfully slowly. The chatter around them only highlighted the strange silence in their corner.\nThe elevator was a confined space, amplifying every sensation. Victoria felt a strange tension in the air, a mix of embarrassment and something more.\nWilliam had only meant to tease her, but feeling her soft body tremble against his brought back memories of their close encounter in the car.\nThose intimate moments, so close and heated, made him want more.",

        "content": "His breathing grew erratic, the fire in his eyes burning brighter.\nHe pulled her slender waist towards him, effortlessly wrapping her in his arms.\nVictoria gasped, but a large hand lifted her chin, and warm lips pressed against hers.\nShe felt like she had been struck by lightning, her entire body stiffening, barely daring to breathe.\nHer heart pounded wildly.\nHer head spun, and she felt as if all the blood in her body had rushed to her cheeks, making her feel unbearably hot.\nThis was in an elevator!\nAny slight movement could draw curious glances from others.\nNot to mention, Alice was just a short distance away. Although William's tall frame shielded her completely, she still felt incredibly guilty and nervous, her throat dry, barely able to breathe.\nWilliam held her wrist with one hand and cradled the back of her head with the other, deepening the kiss. His lips and tongue forcefully pried open her teeth, exploring and entwining with hers, tasting her sweetness over and over.\nHis tongue skillfully delved into her mouth, tangling with her own, sucking, licking, and wrapping around it.\nIt was less a kiss and more an unabashed act of seduction.\nAnd it was happening in plain sight.\nVictoria was kissed until she was dizzy, nearly collapsing in his arms.\nFinally, he released her, one hand braced against the elevator wall, looking down at her with dark, intense eyes, his voice hoarse. \"Victoria, your little mouth only tastes sweet at times like this.\"\nVictoria panted, her heart racing.\nShe felt like a cat's paw was scratching at her heart, both embarrassed and angry, yet unable to do anything about it.\nShe glared at him, her face flushed, saying nothing.\nWilliam chuckled softly. \"What, do you really want to eat me up?\"\nVictoria was frustrated. William was truly shameless, a complete rogue.\nSeeing her puffed-up cheeks, William couldn't help but laugh again, leaning in to kiss the corner of her mouth.\nWith a buzz, the elevator doors opened.\nVictoria exhaled deeply, seizing the opportunity to break free from William's hold, quickly stepping aside, head down, not daring to look at him, and hurriedly stumbled out.\nWilliam watched Victoria's hasty retreat, a faint smile playing on his lips, a mix of satisfaction and laziness in his expression.\nHe leisurely followed, a stark contrast to the domineering intimacy in the elevator.\nAlice trailed behind, her head bowed, her face as pale as a sheet.\nFrom the moment they entered the elevator, her eyes had been glued to William and Victoria, not missing a single movement.\nWhen she saw William lean in close to Victoria, his eyes filled with tenderness and unrestrained desire, her heart felt like it was being squeezed by an invisible hand, the dull pain spreading through her body.\nShe had never seen William like this. Normally, he was polite but distant with her, even when she tried her hardest to get close to him, his eyes never showed such intense emotions.\nHer throat felt tight and dry, filled with bitterness.\nShe remembered the nights she tried to get close to him, even when she let go of all her reservations and exposed herself completely to him.\nHis gaze remained cold, without a ripple, as if she were just a cold statue, unable to stir any desire in him.\nIt wasn't that he was naturally indifferent, nor that she wasn't good enough, but simply because she wasn't the one who could make his heart race.\nLost in her pain, Alice was suddenly bumped on the shoulder.\nShe stumbled, her arm hitting the wall hard, tears welling up in her eyes from the pain, her brows furrowing tightly.\nInstinctively, she looked up, searching for William, hoping for a bit of concern from him.\nBut William's eyes were fixed on Victoria, their figures growing more distant.\nAlice stood frozen, staring blankly in their direction, her heart filled with a flood of resentment and unwillingness.\nOnce, he had promised to protect her for life, but now?\nShe was hurt, and he just ignored it.\nShe was bumped, and he remained indifferent.\nOutside the hospital, William took a few long strides to block Victoria's path.\nHis tall, imposing figure exuded a natural pressure. He slightly lowered his head, his gaze locking onto hers, questioning, \"What do the Brown family take you for? Are you just going to let them pick on you like this?\"\nVictoria turned her head, avoiding his intense gaze, her voice tinged with fatigue and helplessness. \"They didn't really pick on me. Even if they did, it's my own business. I can handle it.\"\nWilliam snorted, a mocking smile on his lips. \"Yeah, you're really something.\"\nVictoria didn't want to argue with him here, feeling irritated, she said, \"I'm leaving.\"\nAs she turned, a strong hand gripped her slender wrist.\nVictoria frowned, trying to shake off his hand, nervously looking around, her tone urgent and unfriendly. \"Let go!\"\nWilliam ignored her, his gaze growing colder, a sneer in his voice. \"His mother came to you and said those things, proving Samuel is useless. Artists like them don't understand social niceties, they act on whims. If he had any sense, he would have stepped in to resolve the conflict early on, not letting his mother have the chance to show off and boss you around!\"\nWilliam didn't give her a chance to defend Samuel, commanding. \"Break up with him.\"\nVictoria laughed in exasperation, a mocking smile on her lips.\n\"Who do you think you are? Why should I listen to you?\"\n\"He's not right for you.\"\n\"Then who is? You?\"\nVictoria's retort was casual, without any hint of suggestion.\nBut seeing William's brows tighten instantly, she realized her words had crossed a line, touching a nerve.\nShe smiled self-deprecatingly, quickly explaining. \"Don't overthink it, I wasn't trying to provoke you, just stating the facts.\"\n\"Yes, I'm,\" he suddenly said.\nVictoria looked at him suspiciously, \"What?\"\nWilliam's gaze was deep, as if it could pull her in, silently staring at her.\n\"William, you're really going to any lengths to ruin my relationship, aren't you?\"\nVictoria understood his meaning instantly, but she didn't believe it, thinking he was just causing trouble again.\nWilliam raised an eyebrow, a cold laugh escaping his lips. \"Relationship? Do you think you're happy? Victoria, is it fun deceiving yourself? Pretending to like him, aren't you tired?\"\n\"I'm not.\"\n\"You think Samuel can't see it?\"",

But once they hit a snag, this feeling proved to be incredibly fragile.\nBut this was her own business, and no one else had the right to interfere, not even William!\n\"William, you weren't even my boyfriend, so what gives you the right to meddle in my life? If you're so bored, why don't you spend more time with your ex-fiancée? Maybe you two can rekindle your old flame!\"\nWilliam's face turned pale, a vein throbbing on his forehead, clearly infuriated.\nIn the past, he would have given Victoria a harsh lesson for such defiance.\nBut he suppressed his anger, staring at her with a dark gaze. \"Didn't you hear what I just said?\"\n\"What? That I should break up, or that you're mocking my unhappiness?\"\nShe deliberately twisted his words, and a flash of coldness crossed William's eyes. He lowered his gaze and let out a cold snort. \"Victoria, listen to me. There won't be a next time.\"\nVictoria turned her head away, unwilling to look at him, and the atmosphere between them instantly dropped to freezing.\nThe sound of high heels clicking on the floor echoed behind them, cutting William off before he could speak out his feelings.\nAlice limped closer, her voice tinged with a hint of grievance. \"William.\"\nIn just a couple of seconds, William composed himself, returning to his usual calm demeanor. He turned to look at her, his gaze falling on her injured foot. \"What happened?\"\n\"I twisted it getting out of the elevator.\" Alice reached out her hand, and William naturally took it, carefully helping her to the car.\nVictoria stood behind, watching coldly, a mocking smile playing on her lips.\nSee, he was always different with Alice.\nIf that was the case, why did he keep bothering her?\nWilliam returned, his gaze sweeping over Victoria as he curtly said, \"Get in the car.\"\n\"No need.\" Victoria's refusal was crisp and decisive, without a hint of hesitation.\n\"Victoria, don't make me angry, or you'll face the consequences.\"\nWilliam reached out, grabbed her arm, and unceremoniously shoved her into the passenger seat.\nVictoria frowned in displeasure, but she wasn't a child anymore and saw no point in struggling. If he wanted to drive her, so be it.\nAlice sat in the back, her eyes glaring at Victoria through her glasses. William said nothing after getting in the car.\nVictoria turned to look out the window. The street scenes flashed by like a slideshow, but her gaze was empty, as she was lost in thought.\nAlice's face grew darker, her expression so gloomy.\nBefore long, the car came to a slow stop.\nWilliam unbuckled his seatbelt and turned to Victoria, his tone still indifferent. \"Wait here.\"\nVictoria snapped back to reality, thinking they had arrived at her place. She was about to unbuckle her seatbelt when she saw William already walking around to the other side, opening the back door and extending his hand to Alice. \"Give me your hand.\"\nVictoria froze, quickly realizing this wasn't her neighborhood.\nOut of the corner of her eye, Victoria saw Alice slowly place her hand in William's, letting him help her out of the car.\nShe vaguely heard him say to Alice as they walked away: \"I'll call a doctor for you.\"\nIn that moment, she realized that when he said \"wait here,\" he meant her!\nWilliam escorted Alice to her door, where a servant came out to greet them. He gently handed Alice over, briefly instructing, \"She twisted her ankle.\"\nJust as he was about to leave, Alice grabbed his arm, her voice pleading. \"William, can you stay with me for a while?\"\nWilliam's gaze fell on her, calm and deep, like an unfathomable, undisturbed pool, never rippling for her.\n\"Get some rest.\" He gently pried her hand away, his movements devoid of any affection.\nBut Alice stubbornly refused to let go, her eyes red and tearful, staring at him. \"I'm hurt, can't you see? Just stay with me for a little while, please?\"\n\"She is waiting for me.\" His tone remained firm as he once again gently pushed her hand away, turning to the servant. \"Take good care of her.\"\nWith that, he walked away without looking back.\n\"William! William!\" Alice's desperate cries echoed behind him, but William's steps never faltered. He quickly disappeared into the night.\nWhen he returned to the car, the passenger seat was empty.\nWilliam's brows furrowed in frustration. He should have known that stubborn Victoria wouldn't obediently wait. He should have locked the car door before leaving.\nFortunately, Victoria hadn't gone far.\nAs the car slowly exited the neighborhood, he spotted her immediately.\nA young man was trying to chat her up, his eyes roaming over her in a way that made William's stomach turn.\nWilliam parked the car, got out, and strode over, placing a firm hand on the man's shoulder. \"A word.\"\n\"Who are you? I don't know you, and I have nothing to say to you.\"\nVictoria saw this and quickly intervened. \"William!\"\n\"This doesn't concern you. Stay put.\" William shot her a cold glance. \"Try running off again and see what happens.\"\nHe forcibly dragged the man towards the bushes, and Victoria bit her lip, her brows knitted in worry.\nThough she knew William was usually measured, she couldn't help but feel anxious.\nNot long after, William emerged, hands in his pockets, calmly buttoning his sleeves as if he had just dealt with a trivial matter.\nVictoria looked past him, puzzled. \"Where's that guy?\"\n\"Gone.\"\n\"I've been here the whole time. I didn't see him leave.\"\n\"He went out the side gate.\"\nIgnoring her doubting gaze, William stepped forward, grabbed her wrist, and pulled her back to the car.\nShe thought he would finally take her home, but to her surprise, the car headed towards her old apartment complex.\n\"Why are we going here?\" She leaned forward, curious. \"Do you still live here?\"\nWilliam turned off the engine and got out, glancing back at her. \"Come on.\"\nVictoria hesitated for a moment before slowly opening the door and getting out, muttering, \"You still haven't answered my question.\"\n\"Yes. For some peace and quiet.\"\nWilliam strode towards the building, and Victoria stood there, full of questions.\nHe walked a few steps, then stopped and looked back at her with a faint smile. \"Are you coming on your own, or do I have to carry you? Either way, the result is the same.\"\nAfter weighing her options, Victoria reluctantly followed.\nWilliam's lips curled into a slight smile, a hint of amusement in his eyes.",

Coming here was already pushing it; she couldn't afford another mistake.\nA hint of amusement curved William's lips as he slowly approached her. \"I told you, I bought this entire floor. Even if something happens between us, no one will know.\"\nVictoria's face turned pale with a mix of shock and anger. \"If that's why you called me up here, then I was wrong about you!\"\nShe turned to leave.\n\"So far, I haven't done anything to Alvin. Do you know why?\"\nAs expected, Victoria stopped in her tracks and turned back, glaring at him. \"William!

Only me.\"\nIf, at the hospital entrance, Victoria could still think he was just messing with her, now she couldn't.\nWilliam might act erratically at times, but deep down, he was proud. He would never use emotions to bind a woman.\nSeeing her silence, William frowned slightly. \"Do you understand what I mean?\"\nHonestly, even if he asked himself, he might not be able to clearly explain his feelings.\nVictoria pressed her lips together and, under his almost stubborn gaze, finally spoke softly. \"I understand.\"\nBut William wasn't satisfied. He stepped closer, their bodies almost touching, and she could feel his warm, rapid breath.\n\"So?\"\nVictoria turned her head, avoiding his intense gaze. \"So, maybe maintaining the status quo is the best choice. Or we could just cut ties.\"\nFor a long time, William didn't respond. Victoria resisted the urge to look back, trying to keep her voice steady. \"If there were no grudges between our families; if we hadn't been in such a degrading relationship, I think I would have fallen in love with you. But reality is what it is. I can't pretend the past never happened, or I would feel disgusted with myself.\"\nWilliam stood by the door, his figure hidden in the shadows, his eyes half-closed, making it hard to read his emotions.\nWhen she said \"disgusted,\" his eyelashes trembled slightly, and the turmoil in his chest seemed to freeze instantly.\nVictoria finished speaking, her head lowered, her body trembling as she tried to suppress her emotions. \"I can't be with you after all your forceful advances. I just can't.\"\nWilliam's Adam's apple bobbed as he struggled to speak, but in the end, he remained silent.\n\"I'll break up with Samuel,\" she said softly. \"But not for you. You're right. I tried, but I never truly loved him. So it's better to end it early and be honest with him. I don't want him to be torn between me and his family.\"\n\"Lastly,\" she looked at him with a complex expression, \"thank you for not hurting my dad. I know, with your power, you could have dealt with him easily, but you didn't. Even though you sent him to prison, you also helped get him out on parole and saved his life in Xandria. So, thank you.\"\nHer words sounded like a final farewell.\nWilliam pressed his tongue against his teeth and let out a self-deprecating laugh. \"You said so much, but never got to the point. You could have just said one thing to make me back off.\"\nVictoria looked at him, puzzled.\n\"You don't like me.\" He stepped closer, his chest almost touching her back. \"Just say you don't like me, and I won't bother you anymore.\"\nVictoria's face turned red with visible panic. \"I...\"\n\"Too late. It's too late to say anything now.\"\nA barely noticeable smile appeared on William's lips as he watched her struggle to explain.\nHe mercilessly pinched her cheek, stopping any words he didn't want to hear.\n\"Victoria, I gave you a chance.\"\nVictoria's eyes widened in disbelief. She had said so much sincerely, yet he still didn't understand.\nWilliam suddenly grabbed her waist, pulling her close, their foreheads touching, his breath hot on her face. His voice was low and seductive. \"If it's not dislike, then it's like.\"\n\"No-\"\nBefore she could finish, William leaned in to kiss her fiercely.\nVictoria's eyes widened, her mind exploding like thunder, and the world seemed to lose all sound.\nShe struggled desperately, and in her panic, she bit him hard!\nWilliam winced, frowning as he let go of her. He wiped his lip and saw the blood on his hand. He suddenly laughed. \"Is it that hard to admit you like me?\"\nShe was both angry and flustered, her face red. \"I don't like you at all!\"\nHe shrugged nonchalantly, a hint of defiance in his eyes. \"I don't care.\"\nWilliam pinched her cheek again, his mood seemingly lifted, a mischievous smile playing on his lips.\n\"From now on, you stay by my side. You're not going anywhere.\"\nVictoria bit her lip, trying to stay calm. She took a deep breath and looked him in the eye. \"So, am I your girlfriend?\"",

        "content": "William was caught off guard. The title that usually seemed so ordinary now felt oddly foreign coming from her.\nHis brief hesitation was like a needle, lightly pricking Victoria's heart, stirring up a wave of bitterness.\nBut she quickly pushed those feelings down, becoming even more composed and determined. \"If you're not sure, don't mess with me.\"\n\"It's not that I'm unsure.\" William, surprisingly serious, paused before speaking slowly. \"I'm just not used to it. When I think of you, all I remember are the intimate moments we spent together.\"\n\"Cut it out!\"\nVictoria's face flushed with embarrassment, and she quickly interrupted him, her voice carrying a hint of playfulness.\nHe smirked knowingly and let out a low chuckle. \"It's just a title. It doesn't change anything for me.\"\nHe paused, locking eyes with her, and said deliberately, \"Let's just call it girlfriend.\"\nVictoria thought William had completely lost his mind.\nEven though he had just asked her to be his girlfriend, she felt no joy at all.\nWithout thinking, she pushed him away forcefully and stumbled towards the door, her voice trembling. \"Stop talking nonsense. There's no way we could ever be together.\"\nWilliam's deep eyes narrowed dangerously, his voice cold and hard. \"Why not?\"\nVictoria's mind was in turmoil, and she shook her head desperately, her face full of resistance. \"Don't ask me why. It just can't happen!\"\nWith that, she practically fled, rushing out the door.\nWilliam stood in the hallway, his brow furrowed, his expression complex and inscrutable.\n\"Well, that was unexpected!\"\nA lazy voice reached his ears. William turned to see Eugene, raising an eyebrow slightly. \"What brings you here?\"\nEugene, reeking of alcohol, leaned casually against the doorframe, a mischievous smile on his lips. \"I can't believe it, William. You confessed to Victoria and scared her off?\"\nWilliam ignored him, his face expressionless as he walked into his room. Eugene, uninvited, swaggered in after him.\nWatching William pour himself a drink and down it in one gulp, Eugene couldn't help but tease, \"Drowning your sorrows in alcohol? That's not like you.\"\nWilliam leaned on the table, his usual cold and indifferent demeanor intact, but the faint mist in his eyes betrayed his inner turmoil.\nEugene found it amusing and raised an eyebrow. \"Did you really think she'd just agree because you asked her to be your girlfriend?\"\nWilliam finally glanced at him, but it was a brief, impatient look.\n\"William! With all the things you've done to Victoria, is it any wonder she wants nothing to do with you? The way you treated her, the pressure you put on her-it's no surprise she rejected you.\"\nWilliam swirled the drink in his glass, his tone certain. \"She has feelings for me.\"\n\"So what?\" Eugene scoffed. \"Having feelings for you is one thing, but resenting and hating you is another. Trust me, women can tell the difference.\"\nWilliam grew increasingly irritated, glaring at him. \"Who invited you here?\"\n\"You bought so many houses. I thought I'd help you make use of them.\"\n\"This place isn't exactly your style, Mr. Eugene Bailey.\"\n\"If you can lower your standards, why can't I?\"\nWilliam didn't believe his excuse and spoke slowly, \"I heard your fiancée showed up?\"\nEugene groaned, \"I don't even know when I got a fiancée! Apparently, it's an engagement my grandfather arranged before he struck it rich. The girl's family hit hard times, and now she's come looking for help. Can you believe it? She's like a bad luck charm, bringing misfortune to her whole family. Even if I didn't have feelings for Grace, I couldn't marry her.\"\n\"What does your family think? Do they want you to marry her?\"\nEugene sighed again. \"My mom's against it, but you know my dad. He's old-school and stubborn. Since it's a promise my grandfather made, he'd sacrifice me to keep it.\"\nHe laughed bitterly. \"Can you believe arranged marriages still exist in this day and age?\"\nWilliam nodded slightly, a faint smile on his lips. \"Yeah, Mr. Bailey is quite the man of principle.\"\nEugene stared at him in disbelief. \"Whose side are you on? I get it now-you can't be happy, so you don't want anyone else to be either!\"\nWilliam raised his glass to him. \"Exactly.\"\nVictoria had been distracted these past few days. Hearing William ask her to be his girlfriend had stirred up her emotions.\nBut she kept reminding herself that it was impossible between them. She couldn't accept or love someone who had humiliated her so many times.\nIt felt like betraying her past self, who had suffered so much.\nAfter dinner, Alvin called Victoria over.\n\"Where's Samuel been lately?\"\n\"His father is sick. He's been busy at the hospital.\"\nAlvin looked at Victoria calmly, with a hint of inquiry in his eyes. \"As his girlfriend, you should be helping him through this.\"\nVictoria opened her mouth but didn't know how to explain. She could only say, \"I've been really busy with work and exams. I can't find the time.\"\nAlvin gave her a long look before lowering his eyes and asking softly, \"Do his parents not like you?\"\nVictoria couldn't tell Alvin the truth and quickly explained, \"No, they like me a lot! I'm just really busy...\"\n\"Victoria.\" Alvin interrupted, his voice steady. \"If there's a problem, I can talk to his parents. I'll take the blame. Don't let them pick on you.\"\n\"That's not necessary!\" Victoria firmly refused. She couldn't bear to let Alvin face such treatment.\nThey fell into silence.\nAfter a while, Victoria spoke softly, \"Dad, if the relationship requires you to humble yourself, it's not worth having.\"\nAlvin lowered his head, full of guilt. \"I'm holding you back.\"\nVictoria smiled, trying to comfort him. \"Dad, don't think that way! I've never felt you held me back. I'm grateful you've always been there for me, so I wouldn't be alone.\"\nHer voice trailed off.\nAlvin felt a pang of sadness. After a moment, he spoke seriously, \"Even if it's not Samuel, it can't be William.\"\nVictoria was taken aback and looked at Alvin. His expression was serious. \"He's not right for you.\"\nVictoria quickly composed herself, looking away. \"I understand.\"\n\"And your mother...\"\nAt the mention of Nora, Victoria frowned. \"Has she been bothering you again?\"\n\"It's about her surgery.\" Alvin paused before continuing. \"She called, asking me to help find a kidney donor.\"\n\"She can't bear to use Bobby's kidney, but she almost tricked me into donating mine back then.\" Victoria's tone was calm, as if recounting someone else's story.\n\"So, I refused her.\" Alvin's response surprised Victoria.\nHis expression was indifferent. \"I don't care how she treats me, but she shouldn't have treated you that way.\"\nVictoria was at a loss for words.\nJust then, there was a knock at the door.\nVictoria opened it to find Samuel sitting on the steps, smoking. From behind, he looked exhausted, a far cry from his usual confident self.",

        "content": "Hearing footsteps, he turned his head slightly and gave Victoria his signature warm smile, though it couldn't hide the deep exhaustion in his eyes.\nVictoria walked over slowly and sat down next to him. \"Just came from the hospital?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nHe stubbed out his cigarette and looked at her, his eyes glimmering with tiny sparks. \"My dad collapsed this afternoon. My mom was crying so hard she couldn't even stand.\"\nHe spoke lightly, with a faint, almost imperceptible smile on his lips.\nSamuel never thought he would face a choice between family and love.\nHe had always been the prodigy artist, sailing through life without much trouble.\nIt wasn't until Elmer fell seriously ill that he realized it wasn't his own brilliance but Elmer's support that allowed him to pursue his passions without worry.\nNow, with Elmer down, it was his turn to support his parents, and he finally understood how hard it had been for them all these years.\nVictoria's heart tightened painfully.\nShe gazed at him, then suddenly raised her hand and gently hugged him.\nSamuel closed his eyes tightly, wrapping his arms around her with force, his voice choked with emotion. \"Victoria, I'm sorry.\"\nWhen Victoria returned home, Alvin was sitting on the couch, smoking.\n\"Where's Samuel?\"\n\"He's gone.\"\nAlvin just sat there quietly, looking at her with a pained expression.\nVictoria walked over slowly, gently took Alvin's arm, and rested her head on his shoulder. After a long silence, she murmured softly, \"Why does it still hurt so much?\"\nAlvin's eyes narrowed sharply, but he just extended his arm and pulled Victoria into a tight embrace.\nVictoria nestled in Alvin's arms, closing her eyes as tears rolled down her cheeks and soaked into her clothes.\nAlvin's embrace was warm and broad.\nBut her heart ached.\nShe understood Samuel deeply, and she wasn't surprised they had reached this point.\nEven without Elmer's sudden illness, there might have been other reasons forcing them to face separation.\nSeeing Victoria like this, Alvin's eyes flashed with determination. \"Do you want me to go talk to him?\"\nLike any father who loves his daughter, Alvin was certain that Victoria had been wronged and that the fault lay with someone else!\nVictoria looked up, a hint of helplessness in her eyes, and a slightly bitter smile on her lips. \"Dad, it's not his fault. He's always tried so hard to be close to me. If anything, I owe him.\"\nHer smile gradually faded, replaced by a look of loneliness.\nMaybe people were like this: they only realized the value of something after it had gone, and then started to miss it deeply.\nAt this moment, memories of Samuel's kindness flooded her mind-their every interaction, his devoted care, selfless affection, unwavering support, and constant encouragement.\nShielding her from all harm and gossip.\nShe hadn't realized that she had developed a special feeling for him, a feeling different from love.\nMaybe even she couldn't be sure if it was romantic love, but it had quietly taken root in her heart.\nThe more she thought about it, the stronger her guilt grew. Even though Samuel had been the one to suggest the breakup, she still felt she owed him too much.\nThe news of Samuel and Hannah's engagement came on three days later, with the ceremony set for the weekend.\nIt came suddenly, yet it made sense.\nEven Wendy, who had been absent for a while, couldn't help but call Victoria.\n\"My uncle got an invitation from the Wright family. That's how I found out Samuel and Hannah are getting engaged.\"\n\"Yeah, I know.\" Victoria's tone was particularly calm. \"If you're free that day, you should go and have some fun. Don't stay cooped up at home all the time.\"\n\"Victoria, are you okay?\"\n\"What could be wrong? We talked it out and broke up amicably. Besides, we didn't have much going on anyway.\"\nVictoria was in the library, studying for exams that were just a week away. She had been focusing most of her energy on her studies.\n\"I heard about Samuel's family situation too. He must be really upset. But he has no choice because of his father.\" Wendy instinctively defended Samuel. \nShe had always supported Victoria and Samuel being together, but fate had other plans.\n\"Victoria, can I ask you something?\"\n\"Sure, what?\"\n\"If Samuel came back to you, would you take him back?\"\nWendy wasn't just asking casually. She believed that Samuel was so devoted to Victoria that he wouldn't give up easily.\nVictoria lowered her gaze slightly, looking out at the bustling street outside the window. She spoke softly, \"He won't, and neither will I.\"\nWendy could only sigh and say no more.\nWhen Hannah walked in, she saw Victoria calmly gazing out the window, looking as beautiful as a delicate painting.\nShe stood at the door for a moment before walking over and sitting down in front of Victoria.\nVictoria looked up, surprised to see Hannah. After a pause, she said calmly, \"Ms. Wright, what can I do for you?\"\nHannah got straight to the point. \"Ms. Carter, I hope you can make time this weekend to attend my and Samuel's engagement party.\"\nWith that, she elegantly took an invitation from her bag and gently slid it across the table.\nVictoria looked at Hannah, feeling a bit strange. \"Ms. Wright, why are you inviting me?\"\nHannah smiled slightly, her tone generous. \"I know you and Samuel were once a couple, and I understand why he agreed to marry me. But that's all in the past. What's important is the future, and that's us being together. So, I hope you can attend our engagement party, to witness it and to formally say goodbye to him.\"\nVictoria understood her meaning and nodded. \"Ms. Wright, don't worry. Since we've broken up, I won't interfere.\"\n\"Then you should come and give your blessings in person!\" Hannah said.\nIf it weren't for Hannah's sincere expression, her words would have sounded like a deliberate provocation.\nVictoria found the request a bit unreasonable. She had agreed to part ways amicably, so why insist she attend?\nSeeing Victoria's displeasure, Hannah was silent for a moment before speaking slowly. \"Ms. Carter, can you understand how I feel? I just want to fully have him, without him lingering in the past. I know he liked you a lot, so can you help me make sure he lets go completely?\"",

        "content": "Victoria froze, lowering her head to look at the invitation Hannah had handed her, her fingers lightly touching the soft red cover.\nAs a woman herself, Victoria understood that Hannah was doing this out of insecurity, seeking some comfort from her.\nAnd Hannah was right; she and Samuel did need a proper goodbye.\nVictoria forced a smile at Hannah. \"I'll be there on time.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Hannah said with a sweet smile before getting up and leaving.\nWatching Hannah's retreating figure, a faint trace of sarcasm crossed Victoria's lips.\nShe was becoming more and more hypocritical.\nOn the weekend, Victoria got up early.\nShe took a long, relaxing bath, then opened her wardrobe to carefully select the perfect outfit. Sitting at her vanity, she meticulously did her makeup.\nSince it was a final farewell, she had to look her best to give Samuel peace of mind.\nBefore leaving, on a whim, Victoria took out the ring box from her drawer, stared at it for a long moment, and finally put it on.\nVictoria stepped out of the car at the hotel entrance, gently lifting her dress as she prepared to walk inside. Suddenly, a group of reporters rushed out from both sides. \"Ms. Carter!\"\nCaught off guard by the sudden appearance of so many reporters, Victoria froze, her steps halting.\n\"Ms. Carter, we've heard you were very close with Mr. Brown. Is that true?\"\n\"So, Ms. Carter, in what capacity are you attending today? As a friend of Mr. Brown or as his ex-girlfriend?\"\n\"Rumor has it that the Brown family disapproved of you, which led to your breakup.\"\nVictoria found herself surrounded, unable to move.\nSeeing the microphones almost touching her face, she quickly raised her arms to shield herself.\nWhere did these reporters get their information?\nTheir relentless questioning drew the attention of many guests.\nHearing the reporters' questions and looking at Victoria, the guests' eyes filled with disdain.\nSo, she was Samuel's ex-girlfriend. Who knew what kind of entanglement they had?\nHer presence here was clearly to cause trouble for the engaged couple. What was she up to?\nVictoria felt utterly humiliated by their gazes.\nThe reporters continued to hound her, and Victoria kept retreating, her face growing increasingly pale. \"These are all baseless rumors. I have nothing to say.\"\nA sharp reporter immediately followed up, \"Are you refusing to respond because you feel guilty?\"\nAt that moment, a slightly cold voice cut in, \"Why are you harassing my girlfriend?\"\nVictoria turned towards the voice and saw William standing at the back of the crowd, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit.\nWilliam strode towards Victoria with long, confident steps.\nHe wore a perfectly pressed black suit, his hair neatly styled, his handsome features exuding a noble and proud aura.\nHe wrapped his arms around Victoria's slender waist, a hint of anger flashing in his eyes before quickly disappearing.\nHe curved his lips into a charming smile and asked softly, \"Baby, did they give you a hard time? If they made you uncomfortable, I can sue their companies into bankruptcy.\"\nThough he whispered in her ear, his voice was loud enough for all the reporters to hear clearly.\nThe reporters exchanged shocked glances. Since when was Victoria William's girlfriend?\nBut then again, rumors about them had been circulating for a while.\nThere had been talk that Victoria was William's sugar baby, and later, gossip suggested she had come between William and Alice, leading to their breakup before the wedding.\nNow, with William publicly declaring their relationship, it seemed to make sense.\nThe reporters were instantly excited. This was a big scoop!\nThey swarmed around the couple, \"Mr. Scott, when did you and Ms. Carter start dating?\"\n\"Ms. Carter, can you tell us why you and Mr. Scott started dating?\"\nThe barrage of questions made Victoria's head spin, like a swarm of flies buzzing around her. She opened her mouth to speak, \"We...\"\n\"We're doing great.\" Before Victoria could finish, William cut her off, smiling as he gently but firmly led her into the hotel. \"The ceremony is about to start. It's rude to be late.\"\nIgnoring the persistent reporters behind them, William kept a relaxed smile on his face, his hand sliding down her shoulder to rest on her waist. \"You don't want to upset the Brown family, do you? Admitting our relationship is the best way to handle this.\"\nVictoria frowned. Though his words made sense, something felt off.\nShe turned her head to glare at William, her eyes filled with anger. \"You planned this, didn't you?\"\nWilliam didn't deny it. Instead, he looked at her with an appreciative, almost amused expression. \"You're not as dumb as you look. But I did come to attend the engagement ceremony. I just didn't expect you to be here.\"\nVictoria turned away, struggling to break free from his hold. \"Do you realize the trouble your words just caused? Not only will our privacy be exposed, but my father will also be dragged into this!\"\nHearing her concern for Alvin, William's eyes grew colder, his tone mocking. \"If he doesn't want to be involved, he shouldn't be in this circle. It's really responsible of him to let his daughter worry about his mess.\"\nHis sarcasm infuriated Victoria. \"I know you still hate him, but I'm his daughter. It's my duty to protect him. If you can't stand it, stay away from me! I never begged you to stay!\"\nWilliam looked at her in disbelief, anger flashing in his eyes. \"Who taught you to use and discard people like this?\"\nVictoria ignored him, taking the opportunity to break free and stride towards the venue.\nWilliam stood there, watching her stubborn back, his eyes darkening.\n\"Having a fight?\" Eugene approached with a smirk, glancing at William. \"Didn't expect you to be so cunning!\"\nWilliam shot him a look, uninterested. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\"Announcing she's your girlfriend in public was a brilliant move! She can't back out now. After all, it's better to be seen as your girlfriend than to be accused of interfering in someone else's relationship.\"\nWilliam casually slipped his hands into his pockets, walking leisurely into the banquet hall. \"Whether she admits it or not, the result is the same.\"\n\"Just a word of advice, don't get too cocky.\"",

        "content": "William waved his hand dismissively, looking completely unconcerned.\nThe banquet hall was extravagantly elegant, like a dreamland. The entire hall was filled with large arrangements of fresh flowers, and a pristine white lace carpet stretched out at the end of the red carpet. In the center stood two massive cake displays.\nThe air was thick with the enticing scent of roses, and the room was filled with well-dressed business moguls and political elites.\nSamuel, dressed in a white suit that accentuated his tall, lean frame, had a handsome face that was marred by exhaustion and irritation. He stood quietly in a corner, as if the day's festivities had nothing to do with him.\nIt wasn't until he saw Victoria walk in that the icy facade on his face showed the slightest crack. He stared at her intently, as if she were just out of reach despite being so close.\n\"I invited her,\" Hannah said softly, approaching him with a gentle smile. \"I thought you should have a proper goodbye.\"\nSamuel's expression darkened, his eyes cold and tinged with anger as he looked at her. \"What gives you the right to make decisions for me? I told you, we don't interfere in each other's business.\"\n\"But I don't agree with that,\" Hannah replied, still smiling but with a steely determination in her eyes. \"Samuel, you're my fiancé. You need to be completely honest with me. If you still have lingering feelings for your ex, I can't accept that.\"\n\"It won't happen,\" Samuel said, his voice tinged with sadness. He then let out a self-deprecating laugh. \"Even if I wanted to, she wouldn't.\"\nHannah's gaze was intense. \"I know you still like her, a lot. That's fine, I can give you time. But I won't tolerate any form of betrayal, even if it's only emotional.\"\nSamuel's lips curled into a slight smile, his eyes narrowing as he spoke through gritted teeth. \"I can call off the ceremony anytime before it starts.\"\nHannah smiled sweetly again. \"Of course, you have that right. But I hope you'll consider your father.\"\nShe glanced over at Elmer, who looked a bit pale but was smiling happily. \"Look how happy he is.\"\nSamuel's brow furrowed, and he bit his lip hard before slowly turning to look at Elmer Has it been a long time since you've seen him this happy?\"\nHannah's voice seemed to have a bewitching power, reaching deep into his heart.\nSamuel looked away from Elmer and back at Hannah, his gaze turning icy. \"Hannah, stop using the same tactics you use on my parents.\"\nHannah's expression faltered, a flash of panic in her eyes, but she quickly regained her composure. \"What do you mean?\"\nHe paused for a moment before speaking slowly. \"I appreciate everything you've done for me, taking care of my parents, keeping them company, making them happy. For that, I'm truly grateful. But...\"\nHis tone suddenly shifted, his eyes filled with warning and distance. \"Since I've agreed to our engagement, I won't go back on my word. But don't think you can control me, and don't try to use the people around me to threaten me. I won't accept it.\"\nWith that, he turned and walked away, his steps firm and unwavering.\nHannah bit her lip, then suddenly shouted at his retreating back, \"You're scared I'll go to her, aren't you? Don't worry, she doesn't care about you at all! You're nothing to her! Don't you get it? You fool!\"\nWatching the couple on stage, Victoria found herself surprisingly calm, though the occasional glances from the Brown family made her uncomfortable.\nShe recognized most of the Brown family members. When she had attended Samuel's grandfather's birthday party as his girlfriend, it had caused quite a stir, and Samuel had to apologize to his elders.\nThose same middle-aged women were now casting cold looks at Victoria while laughing and chatting loudly.\n\"I told you, they would break up eventually!\"\n\"Victoria can't compare to Ms. Wright. She's not good enough for Samuel!\"\n\"Exactly! Ms. Wright is from a noble family, she's beautiful, and most importantly, she's very filial! She even got me some special ointment from abroad for my knee pain. It really works.\"\nVictoria didn't mind. She had heard worse over the years. \nBut William's face was extremely gloomy. He slightly turned his head to glance at Eugene.\n\"I'm not going,\" Eugene pretested.\n\"Should I call your fiancée and tell her where you are?\"\nEugene sighed deeply, looking resigned. \"Remember, I'm doing this to uphold justice, not because you're forcing me!\"\nWith that, he got up and walked over. \"Ladies...\"\nWilliam raised an eyebrow, a faint smile playing on his lips.\nIt was making the best use of resources.\nIn no time, Eugene had the previously cold and sarcastic women laughing heartily.\nJust then, Victoria's name was called from the stage.\nShe looked up to see Hannah holding a microphone. \"Ms. Carter is a mutual friend of Samuel and me. Samuel often praises her talent in painting. Today is our special day, and I wonder if Ms. Carter could paint an engagement portrait for us?\"\nThe spotlight focused on Victoria, and her image appeared on the large screen.\nWilliam glanced at her, displeased.\nHe hated seeing anyone force her, no matter the reason.\nSamuel's face darkened, and he strode forward to grab the microphone, but Hannah deftly sidestepped, whispering so only he could hear, \"I'm helping her gain recognition. Look at the lively atmosphere, and your dad is so happy. What's wrong with asking her to paint? It could even promote her work.\"\nSamuel's eyes were cold, and Hannah felt a chill run through her. \"Hannah, you've gone too far.\"\nShe hesitated, then looked away.\nIn her mind, defending her relationship in this way was justified.\nAfter all, Victoria's award-winning paintings were well-known, and her entanglements with Nora and Bobby were widely discussed. The room buzzed with excitement, and applause erupted.\nVictoria lowered her eyes, silent for a moment.\nHer phone buzzed with a message from William: [If you don't want to paint, don't. No one can force you.]\nVictoria's lips curved into a slight smile.\nIf it were anyone else, she would have refused without a second thought.\nBut Samuel was different. She didn't want to ruin his engagement ceremony.\nBesides, he had painted so many portraits of her, from the large oil painting when they first met in his studio to the pencil sketch on the snowy mountain and the drawing in the hospital.",

She took a deep breath, trying to steady her emotions before looking back at the stage where the handsome couple stood.\nToday, she was going to return all his deep feelings to him. \nHannah's lips curled into a slight smirk, a hint of mockery in her eyes.\nVictoria lowered her head and began to draw, her pencil moving across the pristine paper.\nThe image gradually took shape, each stroke outlining Samuel's handsome features, his gentle, smiling eyes, and his hand entwined with Hannah's, both wearing their engagement rings.\nOutside the hotel, a swarm of reporters had gathered.\nWilliam had publicly announced that Victoria was his girlfriend, and the news had spread like wildfire across social media platforms. The headlines were everywhere.\nMajor news outlets had picked up the story, leaving no room for clarification or retraction.\nVictoria had anticipated some reporters, but she hadn't expected this many!\nBut she had no time to worry about them now. She was anxiously making a phone call.\n\"Dad, we're not dating. He was just helping me out. Really, we're not! I swear!\"\nOn the other end, Alvin's tone was firm and resolute. He was fine with Victoria dating anyone she wanted, except William! \nNo matter what, he would never allow Victoria to get involved with William! Even if it cost him his life, even if he ended up in prison again, he would never let Victoria and William have any entanglements!\nVictoria's heart tightened, and she walked out with her head down, her voice weak, \"Dad, don't worry. I remember what I promised you.\"\nShe hung up, feeling utterly dejected.\nAs soon as Victoria stepped out of the hotel, the reporters swarmed her like sharks smelling blood.\nShe had already prepared a statement to clarify her relationship with William, but a sleek, imposing black Range Rover suddenly pulled up in front of her.\nThe door swung open, and William got out, grabbing her without a word and shoving her into the passenger seat.\n\"William! I didn't say I was going with you!\"\nThe only response was the heavy slam of the car door.\nWilliam quickly locked the doors and hit the gas, speeding away from the reporters.\nVictoria glared at him, both angry and anxious, \"Are you trying to make things worse?\"\nWilliam's expression was equally grim, a cold smile playing on his lips, his words dripping with sarcasm, \"His engagement upset you that much?\"\nVictoria frowned, \"I'm talking about what just happened.\"\n\"Drawing at your ex's engagement party, and so seriously too. You looked like you were about to cry. How much do you still like him? Are you planning to elope with him?\"\nHearing his increasingly outrageous accusations, Victoria's face turned cold, and she snapped back, \"Yeah, I still like him! I can't stand seeing him in trouble! So what?\"\nShe was just going along with his words, but William's reaction was intense. He slammed on the gas, the car speeding wildly down the road.\nThe winding mountain road and the increasing speed made the car tilt dangerously at every turn.\nVictoria was terrified, clutching the handle tightly, her voice trembling, \"Stop! Please stop!\"\nWilliam seemed not to hear, alternating between the gas and brake pedals, his eyes dark and fixed on the road ahead.\n\"William! You're crazy! You might not care about your life, but I don't want to die!\"\nWilliam finally reacted. \"Do you still like him?\" he asked coldly.\n\"Whether I like him or not is none of your business!\"\nThe car swerved sharply, throwing Victoria against the door, her forehead hitting the window hard.\n\"I'm asking you one last time, do you still like him?\"\nThe tires screeched against the pavement, making a piercing noise.\n\"You're insane! No, I don't like him anymore! I don't like him!\" Victoria screamed.\nBut William didn't slow down; instead, he drove even faster, more recklessly.\nShe was terrified, tears streaming down her face, her voice choked and hoarse, \"Please, stop. I'm begging you.\"\nWilliam's eyes were cold, showing no sign of relenting. He glanced at the rearview mirror and said in a low voice, \"Stop crying. Look in the mirror.\"\nVictoria followed his gaze, looking into the rearview mirror. There were only a few cars on the road, but she noticed something unusual: two black sedans were tailing them closely, even through multiple turns.\nHer heart sank. Her first thought was that they were persistent reporters.\nBut on second thought, it didn't seem right. Reporters wouldn't dare provoke William like this unless they wanted to ruin their careers.\nSeeing her confusion, William's lips curled into a cold smile, his eyes fierce, \"It seems some people can't wait any longer.\"\nVictoria looked at his profile, completely puzzled.\nSome people? Was he talking about business rivals?\nAt that moment, more cars appeared in the rearview mirror, all black, like dark phantoms closing in on them.\nSamuel's engagement party was in the suburbs, and the road was desolate, lined with a few abandoned factories, giving off an eerie vibe.\nWilliam frowned slightly. The other side was coming on strong, clearly prepared.\nHe gritted his teeth and muttered, \"Looks like he's serious this time.\"\nDespite the disdain in his voice, Victoria could sense that the situation was serious.\nShe sat up straight, nervously looking back at the pursuing cars, and asked anxiously, \"What do we do now?\"\nBefore she could finish, the car jolted violently, throwing her against the door again, making her cry out in pain.\nShe looked ahead and saw two large trucks blocking the road at an intersection, completely cutting off their path.",

        "content": "The recent harrowing scene had Victoria's heart nearly stopping from fear.\nTheir car had almost crashed head-on.\nWith no other choice, they were forced to turn onto a narrow mountain road. William's brow was furrowed, his stern face heavy with concern. In a deep voice, he said, \"Victoria, send Harry our real-time location.\"\nVictoria quickly pulled out her phone, her fingers flying over the screen as she sent Harry their location.\nOn this mountain road, it seemed like it was just their car and the relentless pursuers behind them.\nWilliam's foot stayed firmly on the gas pedal, the car's speed not decreasing but steadily increasing.\nVictoria knew those people had deliberately driven them onto this road. The thought made her palms sweat, a sense of foreboding rising within her. She was certain those people wouldn't give up easily.\nAfter sending the message, Victoria was still nervous and couldn't help but ask, \"Why didn't you let me send the location earlier?\"\nWilliam had noticed they were being followed much earlier but only told her to send the location after she asked. This puzzled Victoria.\nSeeing his calm demeanor, Victoria wondered if he already had a plan?\nWilliam heard her question and was silent for a moment before a slightly awkward smile tugged at his lips. He joked, \"I thought I could lose them with my driving skills.\"\nVictoria looked at his somewhat guilty expression, feeling both amused and exasperated, momentarily at a loss for words.\nBut somehow, his half-joking remark seemed to ease her panic a bit.\nEven though they had sent a distress signal to Harry, the situation was still dire.\nThe car sped along the winding mountain road, the engine roaring deafeningly, making Victoria's adrenaline spike.\nThe vehicles behind them pursued like phantoms. Amid the noise, Victoria faintly heard the sound of rushing water. She instinctively looked out William's window.\nHer heart sank. The road passed by a cliff, below which a raging, turbulent river flowed.\nSeveral times, the cars behind them nearly caught up, clearly intending to force their car to stop.\nAs they passed another fork in the road, a black SUV suddenly barreled down from the side road.\nThe driver probably never expected so many speeding cars on this mountain road at midnight.\nWith a sharp screech of brakes and a loud crash, it collided violently with one of the pursuing cars.\nInside their car, William's grip on the steering wheel tightened, his knuckles turning white.\nVictoria was so scared she covered her mouth, forgetting to scream.\nWilliam quickly glanced in the rearview mirror, but the smoke and chaos from the crash made it impossible to see if anyone in the other car was still alive.\nHe immediately shifted gears and accelerated, trying to shake off their pursuers.\nVictoria slumped against the seat, her legs weak, still in shock.\nWilliam noticed her pale face out of the corner of his eye and asked, \"Are you okay?\"\nVictoria took a deep breath and shook her head.\nThe cars behind them showed no signs of stopping, relentlessly speeding past the crash site to continue their pursuit.\nVictoria watched the chaotic scene behind them, her heart pounding.\nThis was the second time she faced such a life-and-death moment.\nThe first time, she had been kidnapped and buried alive, thinking she was surely going to die, until William showed up and saved her.\nNow, the threat of death loomed again.\nShe wasn't afraid of dying, but she couldn't bear the thought of what would happen to Alvin if something happened to her.\nThinking of this, Victoria suddenly started crying, tears streaming down her face, sobs escaping her throat uncontrollably.\n\"Victoria?\"\nHearing William's voice, she slowly turned her head, staring at him through tear-filled eyes.\nWilliam frowned at her, his tone unusually gentle, \"Don't be afraid, I'm here.\"\nVictoria stared at him, and whether it was the lighting or something else, William's handsome face seemed to have a faint blush.\nFor some reason, his reassurance inexplicably made her feel a bit calmer.\nThe people behind them seemed to realize that forcing them to stop wasn't easy and crazily decided to speed up and ram them directly. The madness of it sent chills down her spine.\nVictoria gripped the handle above her head tightly, her fingers turning white from the pressure. She looked at William, and in this extremely tense moment, a bizarre thought crossed her mind-if she was with him, even facing death didn't seem so bad.\nWilliam seemed to sense her gaze and turned to meet her eyes, his face showing no panic, but rather a hint of a roguish smile.\nHe raised his chin and asked, \"Do you think we'd die faster if they rammed us or if we drove off the cliff?\"\nHis tone carried a strange excitement, as if they weren't the ones being chased and on the brink of death, but characters in a game he controlled, where life and death were just part of the thrill.\nVictoria followed his gaze to the cliff below, seeing the raging river. If they fell, it wasn't just a matter of the car being destroyed; even if it didn't explode, they could drown in the water.\nShe shivered but knew that if those people caught them, their fate wouldn't be any better.\nVictoria took a deep breath, trying to stay calm, her voice trembling but resolute, \"Either way, we die.\"\nFacing a dead end no matter what, they might as well take a leap of faith. Maybe they could find a slim chance of survival in the midst of despair.\nAfter all, with so many cars chasing them, if they were taken elsewhere, it would be even harder for Harry to find them in this remote area.\nWith this thought, her hand slowly moved to the door lock, ready to face death, determined to go down fighting.\nWilliam glanced at her, a flicker of admiration in his eyes. He smirked and chuckled, \"Hold on tight.\"\nAs a sharp turn appeared ahead, he floored the gas pedal, the car crashing through the guardrail and plunging toward the seemingly all-consuming river below.",

        "content": "Victoria's eyes widened, her pupils contracting sharply!\nThe wind roared in her ears as she plunged into the icy, bone-chilling water, the murky liquid burning her lungs.\nA few minutes later.\nWhen William dragged her onto the shore, they looked like two ghosts crawling out from the depths of the River Styx, utterly disheveled and far from presentable.\nThey lay exhausted on the riverbank, their faces pale as paper, devoid of any color.\nThe moment the car plunged into the water, the windshield shattered instantly from the massive impact.\nFortunately, they had been prepared. The car doors weren't locked, and Victoria and William used all their strength to escape before it was completely submerged and dragged down by the rushing river.\nThe river surged violently, and by the time Victoria finally made it to the shore, she realized they had been carried hundreds of feet downstream from where they had fallen in. The cliff and the road were long out of sight.\nShe coughed out the water she had swallowed, her face expressionless, not knowing how much she had gulped down in the chaos.\nThe rocks beneath her were uncomfortable, but compared to the bone-chilling cold that had seeped into her body, this discomfort was nothing.\nHer clothes were soaked through, clinging tightly to her body. Victoria's teeth chattered uncontrollably as she shivered from the cold.\nThe harrowing struggle for survival had made her acutely aware that they had just danced on the edge of death. A slight misstep, and they would have been gone.\nWilliam, catching his breath, coughed violently but then burst into laughter, as if their brush with death was just an exhilarating adventure, thrilling and fun.\nHe turned to look at Victoria, who was staring back at him.\nVictoria gazed at his face, lost in thought.\nShe couldn't help but wonder what William would look like if he ever showed fear. If she hadn't known some of his childhood stories from Harry, she might have suspected that something had happened to him as a child, making him so crazy.\nVictoria was numb from the cold, her teeth chattering uncontrollably. The biting wind by the river made her shiver even more.\nWilliam looked at her, frowning slightly, his eyes full of confusion. \"Are you cold?\" he asked.\nVictoria felt a wave of helplessness. She wanted to roll her eyes at him but was too cold and exhausted to even make that small gesture. She weakly retorted, \"Aren't you?\"\nWilliam stared at her, his tone calm. \"I'm okay.\"\nHe really was okay. After the initial cold, warmth began to seep back into his body, though it wasn't exactly comfortable. It was still early spring, and the weather was cold, especially after being in the water.\nWilliam, however, found the current atmosphere oddly pleasant.\nHe rolled over and moved closer, water droplets falling from his face onto Victoria's, a playful smile on his lips. \"Surviving a disaster, shouldn't we celebrate?\"\nUnder Victoria's gaze, William slowly leaned down, his cold lips gently pressing against hers, carrying the chill and taste of the river, as if trying to infuse the thrill of their near-death experience into the kiss.\nAt first, it was just a light touch. He closed his eyes slightly, gently brushing her lips, as if confirming something, or maybe comforting her.\nThen, William applied a bit more pressure, prying open her cold-closed lips, his tongue exploring and claiming.\nVictoria was completely stunned by his kiss. She lay there, dazed, as William's arm wrapped around her slender waist, holding her tightly.\nAfter a while, she finally regained her senses and kicked his foot, angrily shouting, \"William, what the hell are you doing!\"\nWilliam gazed at her flushed face, his eyes growing more intense. His hand slid to her chest, caressing through the thin fabric of her dress, his deep, magnetic voice carrying a hint of seduction. \"Aren't you cold? Let me warm you up.\"\n\"I...\"\nVictoria barely got the word out before William's lips covered hers again. His lips were cold, but his tongue was hot, sending electric shivers through her body, making her go weak.\nHis grip on her tightened, and Victoria could clearly feel their body heat rising rapidly.\nWilliam's eyes shone brightly, like stars in the night sky, radiating a dazzling brilliance.\nVictoria's heart raced, her mind going blank. All she could hear was the pounding of her heart.\nFortunately, William hadn't completely lost his senses. Though he enjoyed the intimacy, he knew not to go too far. Finally, he released her, panting slightly. \"We should get going.\"\nThey weren't familiar with the area, but they couldn't stay put. To avoid being found by those chasing them, they had to head into the woods by the river.\nHopefully, Harry would see the message and come find them soon.\nThe bare trees stood desolate, the ground covered in weeds, making it barely passable. Victoria followed William, struggling with each step.\nThe leaden clouds hung low, almost within reach. Victoria fervently hoped it wouldn't rain. In this desolate place, if it rained, they wouldn't find any shelter.\nHer soaked clothes clung to her, each step feeling like it added pounds of weight, making it increasingly difficult to move.\nVictoria was so uncomfortable that she considered taking off her wet jacket, but after a moment's thought, she dismissed the idea. Taking it off might make her even colder.\nShe then noticed that William was only wearing a shirt and pants. He had taken off his jacket and thrown it in the back seat before they started driving.\nVictoria's teeth chattered, her body shivering uncontrollably. In contrast, William walked leisurely, hands in his pockets, his collar open, looking completely unbothered. The difference between them was stark.\nSensing her gaze, William turned his head, his expression relaxed and casual. \"When do you think Harry will find us?\"\n\"I don't know.\" Victoria shook her head slightly, then asked, \"Who are these enemies of yours this time?\"\nWilliam paused, then walked back to her side, looking unperturbed. \"I have an idea.\"\nA mocking smile played on his lips. \"Maybe they're desperate.\"\nHis tone was nonchalant, but Victoria detected a hint of sarcasm. She frowned slightly. \"Why?\"\nWilliam glanced at her, his deep eyes locking onto hers. \"Once I deal with them, I'll tell you.\"\nThen, he could be with her without any worries.",

        "content": "Victoria was freezing and feeling miserable. She tried to wring out the water from her clothes to lighten the load.\nWilliam noticed her struggle and instinctively reached out to help wring out the hem of her dress.\nWatching their actions, Victoria suddenly found the scene amusing and couldn't help but ask, \"Ever been chased like this before?\"\nWilliam tilted his head slightly, pondering for a moment as memories surfaced. \"A few times, but I wasn't exaggerating. I used to be able to shake them off with my skills.\"\nVictoria thought to herself, 'This guy is really something, always making dangerous situations sound like a game. I can't tell if he's truly capable or just careless.'\nBut judging by how he handled things earlier, he didn't seem inexperienced. He must have faced many dangerous situations over the years.\nThey walked and stopped intermittently on the rugged path, unsure of how much time had passed.\nVictoria estimated that even if they retraced their steps now, it would be hard to find the spot where they had come ashore.\nWilliam alternated between walking beside her and scouting ahead. After a while, he habitually looked back to check on Victoria, only to find she had fallen far behind.\nHe quickly walked back, ready to ask if she was okay, but saw her slowly lift her head, her cheeks unnaturally flushed, and her eyes filled with exhaustion.\nWilliam's heart tightened. He hurried to her side and gently touched her forehead, feeling the heat. \"You seem to have a fever.\"\nVictoria weakly touched her face, realizing it was burning hot. She really did have a fever.\nNo wonder she felt like her body was getting heavier and heavier. She had thought she was finally warming up, but it was actually the fever.\n\"Your constitution is really something,\" William couldn't help but tease. Then, without hesitation, he squatted down in front of her and patted his back. \"Get on, I'll carry you.\"\nVictoria didn't hesitate, leaning onto his back and wrapping her arms around his neck. \"Your constitution is the unusual one.\"\nWilliam carried her forward, his tone smug. \"Thanks for the compliment.\"\nAfter a while, Victoria mumbled something in a daze. William turned his ear to her. \"What did you say?\"\nVictoria exhaled warmly and raised her voice. \"I said, I want to pass my constitution to you, and my illness too.\"\nWilliam could feel Victoria's face pressed against his neck, her cheek's heat seemingly penetrating his skin.\n\"Alright,\" he said softly, \"give it all to me.\"\nVictoria was light, and William carried her for a long time, feeling the already gloomy sky grow darker.\nHer clothes were wet, but her face was burning hot.\nVictoria fell asleep on his back, or rather, her fever worsened.\nAt first, she could still chat with him intermittently, but later, when William called her, she barely responded.\nWilliam had never felt Harry was this slow before, growing increasingly frustrated, thinking he would dock Harry's bonus for the entire year.\nIn the dim forest, faint sounds emerged. William looked up and saw a few beams of light in the distance. He put Victoria down and shielded her, recognizing the group with flashlights.\nHe sighed in relief, seeing Harry and Alvin leading the group.\nWilliam hadn't expected to see Alvin here, and a sense of foreboding crept into his heart.\n\"Victoria.\"\nHearing the call, Victoria woke up abruptly and hurriedly pulled away from William's embrace. \"Dad.\"\nThe swelling on Victoria's lips was too obvious for Alvin to miss.\nHe looked at her with a mix of disappointment and heartache, his lips tightly pressed as he suppressed his anger. \"Come with me.\"\nWilliam glared coldly at Alvin, a mocking smile on his lips, his eyes full of provocation. \"Alvin, she's not your possession.\"\nAlvin finally focused on William, and the next second, he swung a punch.\nVictoria's heart skipped a beat. Without thinking, she instinctively rushed forward, spreading her arms to shield William.\nAlvin was shocked and stopped his punch abruptly.\nWilliam stared at the small figure in his arms. She was petite, just reaching his chin, her face flushed from the fever, yet she was trying her best to protect him.\nIn that moment, William felt a warm current flow through his heart, filling the usual restlessness and emptiness with her protective gesture.\nVictoria slowly opened her tightly shut eyes. Realizing what she had done, she panicked and broke free from his embrace, stumbling back. \"Dad, I...\"\nShe was filled with regret, knowing she had made a big mistake. She kept asking herself inwardly, 'What was I doing? Why did I protect William?'\nAlvin glared at her for a long time before gritting his teeth and saying, \"Come here, I'll carry you to the hospital.\"\n\"Okay.\" Victoria lowered her head and obediently lay on his broad back.\nWilliam watched Victoria, her head drooping as she lay on Alvin's back, unable to calm down.\nIt wasn't until he got into the car that he seemed to snap out of it, pulling out a cigarette and lighting it.\nThe gray smoke quickly filled the car, blurring his vision.\nVictoria felt like she was in a scorching desert or a humid tropical rainforest. Her body was unbearably hot, and her head was heavy.\nWhen she woke up earlier, she saw Alvin sitting by her bed with a stern expression. The white walls and sheets made her realize she was in a hospital.\nHer thoughts were slow, and her breathing was heavy. Alvin touched her forehead and told her to keep sleeping if she felt uncomfortable.\nVictoria vaguely remembered that she and William had been walking in the woods, and now Harry and Alvin had found them. They were safe.\nThank goodness.\nShe relaxed and fell back into a deep sleep.\nWhen she woke up again, she was drenched in sweat, tiredly opening her eyes. The room was dark, indicating it was late at night.\nShe moved her body, feeling somewhat better, though still dizzy.\nTurning her gaze to the side, Victoria was startled to see someone sitting by her bed.",

        "content": "Through the dim light filtering in from the streetlamp outside, Victoria could just make out that the person sitting by her bed wasn't Alvin, but William.\nVictoria felt her throat had recovered enough to speak, so she croaked out, \"Can you not sit by my bed without saying anything?\"\nThe room was still dark, with no lights on, making everything seem even more shadowy.\nWilliam remained silent, his head turned to the side.\nVictoria was puzzled, not understanding what was going on with him.\nThe silence in the room grew, and Victoria began to wonder if the figure she was seeing was just a fever-induced hallucination.\n'Fine, if he doesn't want to talk, let him be,' she thought.\nVictoria's breathing was heavy as she closed her eyes again, soon falling back into a deep sleep.\nIn the middle of the night, she vaguely felt someone holding her. The person was warm, pressed tightly against her.\nShe guessed it was William.\nVictoria didn't push him away. Her face was hot, and her breath was warm, but her limbs were cold, making her feel unusually chilly.\nWilliam rested his head on top of hers, his arms wrapped tightly around her.\nIn his embrace, Victoria felt like she was being warmed by a heater, feeling an unusual sense of peace.\nWhen she woke up the next morning, William was gone.\nVictoria was still feverish, but she felt much better than the day before.\nShe spent the morning in her hospital room, and Alvin came to see her once, his face still extremely grim, not saying much.\nFrom him, Victoria learned that she would need to stay in the hospital for a while longer for some tests to check for any other complications.\nIn the hospital room, all she did was sleep and eat. Because of her fever, she couldn't taste anything, making every meal feel bland.\nHer phone had been retrieved from the river, and Alvin brought it to her. The phone was completely ruined, but fortunately, the SIM card was still usable.\nVictoria inserted the card into the new phone Alvin had bought for her. When she turned it on, a news article popped up on the browser: #Chain Car Crash on Mountain Road Near Silvermist City, Scene Shocking.\nHaving survived the ordeal, Victoria was curious about how the incident was reported.\nShe clicked on the article, which briefly described the car crash on the mountain road that resulted in seven deaths. One of the images was of the two cars that had collided the day before.\nNone of the images showed the faces of the victims, just a few distant shots of bodies covered with white sheets.\nVictoria frowned at the picture.\nThe people who had been chasing them were dead.\nDid William do it?\nProbably not.\nHe was with her the whole time.\nVictoria scrolled down and saw a pinned comment.\n[My uncle works at the police station. He told us this crash isn't as simple as it seems. It might be related to a personal vendetta.]\nThe comment had many replies, most of them expressing curiosity about the details of the crash.\nBut the commenter hadn't replied to any of them.\nVictoria got out of bed to pour herself a cup of hot water, watching the few people passing by outside.\nFeeling cooped up in the hospital room, she put down the cup after drinking and opened the door. Before she could step out, two burly men in black suits and sunglasses standing on either side of the door turned to look at her.\nVictoria fell silent.\nShe quietly stepped back and closed the door.\nThese two were probably bodyguards sent to protect her, but she didn't know if they were arranged by Alvin or William.\nThe sight of them had been a shock, and she sat back on the bed, picking up her phone. She noticed that the commenter had replied to their own comment.\n[The cause of death for these people wasn't the crash. It was a vendetta. My uncle told me this in secret.]\nThis reply sparked even more curiosity, but also some skepticism.\n[Nice story.]\n[What's your uncle's name? Badge number?]\n[The news said they died in the crash. If you're making up stories, at least check the facts!]\nThe skeptical replies seemed to anger the commenter. Victoria refreshed the page and saw that they had added two more replies:\n[Believe it or not, what do I gain from making this up?]\n[Let me tell you more. Their throats were slit. When the police found them, they were already dead.]\nVictoria wanted to see what else the commenter would say, but the network lagged. When she reloaded the page, the comment and all its replies were gone.\nShe scrolled through the comments, finding only scattered remarks from other users.\nVictoria didn't dwell on the comment, thinking it was too far-fetched. Though she was curious about what happened to the pursuers after she and William fell into the river.\nIf she asked William, he probably wouldn't tell her. Otherwise, he would have mentioned it last night.\nVictoria stayed in the hospital for two more days. When she was fully recovered, Alvin came to take her home.\nSeeing his still grim face, Victoria felt uneasy and didn't dare to speak on the way home.\nOnce they were back, Alvin turned to her, glaring angrily. \"What did you promise me before? Why are you still entangled with him? He'll get you killed, don't you understand?\"\nVictoria stared at Alvin, stunned. He had always been loving and gentle with her, never scolding her so harshly.\nWhen he found out that Victoria and William had gone off the cliff together, he nearly broke down. The thing he had feared most had happened-Victoria got into trouble because of William.\nThankfully, they both survived without life-threatening injuries.\nBut just knowing the details was enough to understand how ruthless William could be.\nVictoria had narrowly escaped this time, but what about next time? And the time after that?\nAlvin couldn't bear to think about it. He couldn't allow Victoria to continue being involved with William.\n\"I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't want to lie to you. I really do love him.\" Victoria bit her lip, her eyes reddening as she looked down at her feet. \"I thought being with Samuel would help me forget him, but I can't. I just can't.\"\nAlvin suddenly turned and slapped her hard.\nVictoria was stunned, holding her cheek as she stared at Alvin in disbelief. He had never hit her before.\n\"Victoria! No matter what sweet lies William has told you, remember this: his parents died because of me! Do you think you mean more to him than his parents? He's using you to get revenge on me! I warned you to stay away from him, but you didn't listen. He paid you to sell your body, and you fell for him? Are you really that willing to degrade yourself?\"",

She kept her head down, walking aimlessly, tears flowing uncontrollably, occasionally wiping them away with her hand.\n\"Why are you crying?\"\nThe sudden voice startled her. She looked up in surprise.\nWilliam, frowning, exhaled a puff of smoke, then stubbed out his cigarette. He walked over quickly, taking off his jacket and draping it over her shoulders.\nSeeing her face, his expression darkened. \"Did Alvin hit you?\"\nBefore she could respond, his eyes turned cold, and he started to march back towards the house to confront Alvin.\nHe couldn't bear to hurt Victoria, and Alvin dared to lay a hand on her?\nVictoria snapped out of her daze and grabbed his arm, shouting angrily, \"Can you stop causing trouble for me? I'm in this mess because of you!\"\nWilliam halted.\n\"I've paid my dues, haven't I? I'm begging you, disappear from my life! I don't want to see you again! I don't want any more ties with you. Just let me go. Whoever you like, whoever you want as your girlfriend, it's none of my business!\"\nShe clutched his collar, her emotions spiraling out of control. \"Am I that unlucky? Why do you treat me like this? I've given you everything I could, almost lost my life for you multiple times. I just want a peaceful life now. Why can't you let me go? Why?\"\nShe cried until she had no strength left, collapsing to the ground, hugging herself tightly, gasping for breath.\nWilliam watched her quietly for a while, then turned and left.\nSoon, his car started and slowly drove out of her blurred vision.\nWilliam had his pride, more so than most men.\nThe fact that he didn't get angry at her accusations was already remarkable.\nHowever, Victoria's mood didn't improve with his departure. Instead, she felt even more oppressed, a wave of indescribable loss washing over her.\nAs Victoria wished, her life returned to calm.\nEven the dramatic moment when William declared their relationship at Samuel's engagement party, along with the subsequent chase, didn't stir up much of a buzz online.\nWhen the hospital called, Victoria hesitated for a moment but decided to go.\nNora's attending physician, Dr. Myers, looked serious as he spoke to them. \"Bobby ultimately refused.\"\nVictoria wasn't surprised. It would have been strange if Bobby had agreed.\nIn this regard, Bobby was no match for Ella.\nBobby would rather go back to prison than harm himself for Nora, while Ella was willing to give Alice a kidney for William. Such courage wasn't common, though it wasn't something to be encouraged. After all, there weren't many people \"foolish\" enough to do that.\n\"Finding a suitable kidney donor is very unlikely. Given Nora's current condition, she won't last long. So, I hope you can prepare yourselves mentally.\"\nLeaving the doctor's office, Victoria wore a grim expression.\nNo matter how bad Nora was, she was still her mother. Facing life and death, how could she not worry?\nVictoria stood outside Nora's hospital room for a long time before slowly pushing the door open.\nNora looked extremely haggard. Without makeup, her face seemed to have aged decades, her cheeks sunken, skin dull, dark circles under her eyes, and her body emaciated.\nVictoria pulled up a chair and sat quietly by the bed.\nAfter a while, Nora opened her eyes. Seeing Victoria, the hope in her eyes quickly faded.\n\"Thought it was Bobby?\"\nVictoria's words made Nora agitated, but her voice was still weak and hoarse. \"What are you doing here? Checking if I'm dead? Stop pretending to care. Get out, get out!\"\nVictoria smiled wryly. Even now, she had the strength to curse her, showing how much she truly hated her.\n\"Dr. Myers is already looking for a kidney donor for you,\" Victoria said calmly.\nNora sneered. \"Why bother? You're the perfect match. Give me your kidney, and I'll live.\"\nVictoria raised an eyebrow. \"Why not Bobby?\"\n\"He's different from you! He's the product of my true love. He's suffered so much. How can you bear to hurt him? I'm right, aren't I? You're the most heartless. You'd let your own mother die!\"\nShe cursed viciously, as if all her misfortunes were Victoria's fault.\nVictoria didn't argue, used to it by now.\nWhen Nora was tired of cursing, Victoria even fetched her a glass of water, inserting a straw and handing it over.\n\"I don't need your fake concern!\" Nora said, but when Victoria brought the straw to her lips, she couldn't help but drink a few sips.\nHer throat soothed, she continued cursing.\nVictoria put down the glass, went to the bathroom, and got a towel to gently wipe her down.\n\"Don't think I'll forgive you for this! I'll tell everyone you're a monster, letting me die when you could save me! You want me dead. You're a murderer!\"\nVictoria ignored her, continuing to wipe her down.\nMaybe her silence angered Nora. Nora raised her hand to hit her, but Victoria easily caught it and pressed it down.\n\"Monster! You're a curse! If it weren't for you...\"\nVictoria could recite the rest of her words by heart, but she remained silent.\nThen, she found a clean hospital gown and helped her change.\nNora loved beauty and cleanliness, but who cared about that in the hospital? Even hired caregivers couldn't be so meticulous.\nDespite Victoria's care, Nora kept cursing.\nFinally, Victoria stopped and looked at her. \"Does humiliating me make you feel better?\"\nNora glared at her, tears welling up. \"If it weren't for you, would I be in this state? It's all your fault! You're a jinx!\"\nWatching Nora's tears, Victoria couldn't tell if she was mourning her lost glory or her harsh fate.\nBut it didn't matter anymore.\nAfter finishing her care, Victoria faced her calmly. \"What I'm about to say will be our last conversation.\"",

Why should I go to him?\"\nVictoria slowly raised her eyes, her voice steady, \"I won't do it.\"\nNora laughed bitterly, like she'd heard the most ridiculous joke, \"This is my wonderful daughter! You'd rather watch me die than give me a kidney!\"\nVictoria didn't flinch, nodding, \"Yes, I would.\"\nNora narrowed her eyes, mocking, \"What if it was your father lying here?\"\n\"I wouldn't think twice.\"\nEven though she expected it, Nora was still furious, \"Don't forget who gave birth to you!\"\nVictoria stayed calm, \"I don't want to hurt the people who love me for someone who doesn't. Even now, you have a choice. Between Bobby and me, you chose him without a second thought. I'm not heartless; I get disappointed, sad, and even blame myself for not being good enough. It wasn't until I almost ended up on the operating table last time that I realized the problem was never me. To you, I'm nothing.\"\nVictoria's face remained composed as she spoke her truth.\n\"You're just making excuses! You're heartless and cold-blooded! Even if I die, I won't let you off! I'll haunt you as a ghost!\"\nVictoria had said all she needed to and got up to leave.\nAs she walked out of the hospital room, the cursing inside turned into low sobs, then heart-wrenching wails.\nVictoria left without looking back.\nThe entrance exam for the University of Aesthetics Shine had arrived.\nAlthough Victoria was confident she could pass, she didn't dare to be complacent.\nIt wasn't until she finished all the exams that she finally breathed a sigh of relief.\nAs she was about to leave the University of Aesthetics Shine to return to work at Starry Studio Gallery, she saw Samuel near the office of the university's president, Albert.\nHe looked very different. If he used to be calm and elegant, now he seemed mature and gloomy.\nHe was talking to Albert, who had a regretful expression on his face.\nSensing someone looking at him, Samuel glanced over.\nWhen their eyes met, he froze for a moment.\nVictoria gave him a slight smile and nodded, intending to leave.\nUnexpectedly, he quickly said goodbye to Albert and chased after her, \"Wait.\"\nVictoria didn't stop.\nSamuel hurriedly ran a few steps to block her path.\n\"Running away as soon as you see me? Am I that scary? No matter what, even if we're not a couple, we're still friends, right?\" Samuel said with a bitter smile, looking at her delicate profile, feeling a sudden warmth in his eyes.\nVictoria was amused by him, her initial awkwardness easing, \"How have you been?\"\nHe forced a smile, \"Honestly? Not great.\"\nHe was always honest with her.\n\"But there's some good news. My dad's surgery was quite successful.\"\n\"Really? That's wonderful!\" Victoria was genuinely happy for him.\n\"Thanks,\" he said, then chuckled, \"When did we get so formal?\"\nVictoria's smile faded, her expression sincere, \"Samuel, I've always wanted you to be happy.\"\n\"Happy? Yeah, happy. I don't even know what that feels like anymore.\"\nHis words were a mix of truth and sarcasm, making it hard to read him.\nEven after they parted, Victoria felt uneasy.\nThough their time together wasn't long, she knew him well enough. His eyes were full of exhaustion and pain.\n\"You're here for the exam, right?\" Samuel suddenly changed the topic.\nVictoria nodded.\nHe smiled, \"Congrats, you'll definitely pass.\"\nVictoria smiled back, \"Thank you.\"\nSamuel smiled again, \"Too bad I can't teach you anymore.\"\nVictoria was momentarily stunned, \"Why?\"\nA hint of sadness flashed in Samuel's eyes, \"I resigned. My dad's health can't handle managing the company anymore. The company is my dad and grandpa's legacy. I can't let it fall apart because of my selfish interests.\"\nVictoria was silent for a while before slowly speaking, \"That's a real shame.\"\nHe was an excellent artist and a great teacher.\nSamuel took a deep breath and smiled again, \"Don't worry, I'll still deliver the two paintings a month to your gallery as promised. You can always ask me for help if you need it.\"\nHis words made Victoria's heart ache even more.\nSamuel was the best artist she had ever met and the teacher she admired most.\nIf possible, she wished he could stay at the University of Aesthetics Shine, doing what he loved.\nBut life is unpredictable.\nSuppressing her thoughts, she forced a smile, \"Thank you. But don't push yourself. You've already done so much for me. I'll handle the rest.\"\nSamuel's expression turned bitter, \"Are you cutting off our last connection too?\"\nVictoria shook her head, speaking earnestly, \"Samuel, it's not me cutting off the connection. You're engaged now. I hope we can both move on.\"\nHer attitude was firm and harsh.\nSamuel stared at her for a long moment, then forced a bleak smile, \"Alright, I understand. You're right.\"\nWith that, he gave her one last deep look, turned, and walked away resolutely.\nHis figure looked desolate, his steps unsteady, as if he had aged years in an instant.\nVictoria stood still, watching him disappear around the corner, tears glistening in her eyes.\nLeaving the school, Victoria returned to the gallery to continue working. She had only taken a half-day off, and the accumulated work kept her busy for a long time.\nWith Alvin's business gradually stabilizing and her artwork royalties coming in, life had become much more comfortable without Nora's burden.\nEven so, she continued working at Starry Studio Gallery.\nNot only because she had worked hard to get this job, but also because she could learn a lot here. She truly loved this job.\nIn the afternoon, when she finally had a moment to drink some water, she habitually checked her phone and found several missed calls.\nStartled, she quickly checked and saw they were all from Wendy, who had taken a long leave and hadn't been at work for a while.\nVictoria's heart tightened. Wendy wouldn't call so many times unless it was urgent!",

        "content": "Victoria immediately called back.\nBut the phone rang for what felt like forever without anyone picking up.\nStarting to panic, Victoria turned to a colleague. \"Hey, have you heard from Wendy lately?\"\nThe colleague shook her head. \"I sent her a few texts, but her replies were super short. It seemed like she didn't want to talk, so I stopped trying.\"\nVictoria's face grew serious. After dialing four more times, someone finally answered.\nVictoria instantly recognized Carol's voice. \"Mrs. Clark, where's Wendy?\"\n\"She's not feeling well. She's resting in her room.\"\n\"Is she still sick? Should I take her to the hospital...\"\nBefore she could finish, Carol cut her off, \"Do you have any other business?\"\n\"Wendy won't be coming to work for a while. She needs to rest at home. I've already informed her supervisors. You guys shouldn't visit her either. I don't want her to be disturbed. That's all.\"\nThe call ended abruptly.\nVictoria stared at her phone, her brows furrowing tightly. \"I need to check on her.\"\nAfter handing off her work to a colleague, she rushed to Wendy's house as fast as she could.\nIt was a charming, secluded little house, peaceful and elegant.\n\"I can't just barge in. Wait here for a bit,\" Victoria muttered to herself.\nShe hid behind a row of bushes, her eyes fixed on the house across the street.\nBefore long, a graceful middle-aged woman emerged from the house. It was Carol, talking on her phone, her expression alternating between happiness and shyness.\nVictoria watched her drive away before quickly running over.\nShe rang the doorbell, but after a while, there was still no response.\nVictoria was full of suspicion. 'Could she not be home?'\nBut she immediately dismissed the thought, 'She has nowhere else to go.'\nUnwilling to give up, Victoria circled the house and finally found an open kitchen window.\nWithout hesitation, she climbed through the window.\nOnce inside the kitchen, Victoria was stunned, and then a wave of intense anger surged through her.\n\"How could anyone do this?\"\nOn the kitchen floor, Wendy lay unconscious, her face flushed, her body burning with fever.\nIn just a few days, her once round face got so thin it was hard to recognize, her chin sharp.\nWhat was even more infuriating was the collar around her neck, attached to a six-foot chain.\nThis meant Wendy's movements were restricted to just six feet!\nVictoria's eyes filled with tears. Though Nora wasn't great, she had never treated her like this.\nBut Wendy's mother, Carol, didn't even see her as human, treating her like an animal.\nWendy was burning with fever, and Victoria couldn't afford to waste a moment. She frantically tried to remove the collar but found it locked. She needed a key.\nDesperately searching the house, she couldn't find the key. Fortunately, she spotted a pair of pliers in the corner. With great effort, she used them to roughly cut the collar off.\nThough Wendy was slender, she was unconscious and limp, making it difficult for Victoria to lift her. After a few steps, she was already out of breath, her arms trembling.\nFinally managing to get Wendy to the door, Victoria hailed a cab and urged the driver to hurry to the hospital.\nVictoria had planned to call the police, but they found her first.\n\"Breaking and entering?\" Victoria exclaimed.\n\"Yes, and the homeowner reported a lot of important items missing.\"\nVictoria was stunned, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"You seriously believe what she said? This is outright extortion!\"\nAnd so, Victoria was taken to the police station.\nWith surveillance footage clearly showing her climbing through the window, the evidence was undeniable.\nSitting in the police station, feeling helpless, Victoria suddenly saw a familiar figure.\nIt was William!\nVictoria quickly turned her head, pretending not to see him.\nAt the same time, the police chief personally escorted him to the door. William also avoided eye contact.\n\"Mr. Scott, thank you for your cooperation.\"\n\"No problem.\" William turned and left.\nSeeing him leave like that, Victoria felt a mix of emotions but also a sense of relief.\nAfter they had laid everything out, Victoria felt it was best for both of them to cut ties completely. It was the right choice for both of them.\nFor now, she had to admit, William handled it well.\nThe police chief came in a while later, glancing at Victoria as he walked in. He called over the officer in charge and whispered a few instructions.\nVictoria sat alone, listening to Carol's lawyer's aggressive questioning and the mounting accusations, remaining silent.\nShe knew that until she saw her own lawyer, saying anything could make things worse.\nAs for hiring a lawyer, Victoria was determined to apply for legal aid.\nShe didn't want to make a big scene. If it blew up, Wendy would be the one most hurt. If it left her with any psychological scars, it would be terrible.\nUnexpectedly, the police worked quickly, following the clues to find Wendy. Soon, the abuse she suffered at Carol's hands came to light.\nThere was no hiding it now. The story made the news, causing an immediate uproar in the community. People were outraged, condemning such vile behavior.\nSoon, Carol and her husband's identities were exposed, and people online began to remark.\n[Carol looks so polished, but how could she be so cruel to her own daughter? She's a wolf in sheep's clothing!]\n[That man is no better. Cheating on his wife and neglecting his family. Scum!]\nBut some people turned their criticism towards Wendy.\n[Look at Wendy, her face swollen, smelling bad. She doesn't look like a lady at all.]\n[She's so weak. Her own parents abuse her, and she doesn't fight back? I think she's an idiot.]\n[Exactly. Being treated like that and not fighting back, she might as well be dead.]\nThese malicious comments, like daggers, flooded the internet.\nSeeing this, Victoria gritted her teeth in anger. \"Wendy is the victim here. How can they blame her? Don't they have any compassion?\" She had only one thought: Wendy must not see these hurtful words.\nJust then, the hospital called. \"Come quickly! Wendy Clark's in trouble!\"",

Some were frantically taking pictures with their phones, and the firefighters had already set up an inflatable cushion.\nLooking up, Victoria saw the person standing on the edge of the roof.\n\"Wendy!\" Victoria was stunned, her heart clenched tightly, and without hesitation, she rushed into the building.\nShe sprinted up the stairs, breathless by the time she reached the rooftop. Seeing the police, she quickly explained, \"I'm her friend, please let me through.\"\nAfter confirming her identity, the police let her pass. Victoria ran over and saw Wendy's mother, Carol, was also there.\n\"What are you doing? Get down here right now!\" Carol tried to maintain a facade of calm, but her trembling hands betrayed her panic, and her face was pale.\nWendy stood motionless at the edge of the roof, her figure so frail it seemed a gust of wind could knock her over.\nShe stared blankly into the distance, ignoring Carol's shouts, as if those cruel words could no longer hurt her.\n\"Wendy!\" Carol couldn't hold back any longer and yelled, \"You useless thing, get down here! Who do you think you are, trying to jump off a building? Don't want to come down? Fine, jump then! Even your dad doesn't want you, what's the point of living? If you're going to jump, just do it already!\"\nThe firefighters and police behind her were shocked, \"Ma'am! You can't provoke her right now...\"\nBefore they could finish, Carol cut them off harshly, \"Why should I care if she lives or dies? She should have disappeared from this world a long time ago! My life has been miserable because of her!\"\nShe was about to continue her tirade when someone suddenly shoved her from behind.\nCarol, wearing high heels, stumbled and nearly fell.\n\"Shut your mouth!\" Victoria's eyes were wide with anger, her eyes red, glaring at Carol, \"Wendy is such a good girl! If you want to die, then jump! If not, get out of the way!\"\n\"This is a family matter, what does it have to do with you?\"\n\"Get out of the way!\" Victoria shouted again.\nIf the situation weren't so critical, Victoria would have loved to give her a piece of her mind.\nShe stepped past Carol and walked towards Wendy at the edge of the roof, \"Wendy!\"\nWendy, who had been unresponsive, slowly turned her head at the sound of Victoria's voice.\n\"Victoria.\" She called out softly, her eyes instantly filling with tears, \"Victoria, why did you take so long?\"\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm late.\" Victoria cautiously took a step forward, but Wendy, crying, shook her head, \"Don't come any closer.\"\nThe police behind her quickly pulled Victoria back, whispering, \"Don't go too close, it might agitate her.\"\nVictoria stopped and reached out her hand, \"Wendy, come over here, it's too dangerous over there. Let's talk over here, okay?\"\n\"They're cursing me, saying I deserve this. Yeah, I deserve this. I don't even deserve to be alive.\"\nVictoria couldn't understand where the bright, confident Wendy she first met at Starry Studio Gallery had gone.\nBack then, she was positive, optimistic, and cheerful, as beautiful as a flower, with a stubborn streak. But how had she become so despondent and hopeless in just a few months?\nVictoria's heart ached, and tears streamed uncontrollably down her face.\nShe choked out, \"Wendy! Let them say whatever they want. You can live however you want! Don't worry about what others think!\"\nWendy's face was streaked with tears, and she kept repeating, \"Victoria, why did you take so long? Why?\"\nVictoria, desperate, took a few more steps forward. \"Wendy, this is my fault. I promise, I'll stay by your side from now on, okay? Please come down.\"\nWendy looked at her and gave a sorrowful smile. \"Victoria, I really like you. Working with you these past few months has been the happiest time of my life. But why did you only show up now?\"\nShe kept looking at Victoria, smiling and shaking her head. \"Why?\"\n\"No, no, Wendy, don't!\"\nVictoria sensed something was wrong and, disregarding the danger, lunged forward. \"Wendy!\"\nWendy closed her eyes slowly, her body leaning back.\n\"Wendy!\"\nVictoria's fingertips brushed against her, desperately trying to grab hold, but it was in vain.\nPeople behind her rushed to hold Victoria back. \"Don't go!\"\n\"No, no!\"\nVictoria watched helplessly as Wendy fell before her eyes.\nWendy looked at her, a relieved smile on her lips.\nShe whispered, \"Goodbye, Victoria.\" \nVictoria sat on the rooftop, curled up into a small ball, her eyes vacant and hollow, her trembling pupils revealing her inner turmoil.\nWendy had jumped, right in front of her.\nShe hadn't been able to catch her, even though she was so close. If she had just reached out a little further, maybe she could have saved her, but it was too late.\nIf she had been faster, if she had noticed Wendy's despair sooner.\nThese thoughts haunted her mind, swirling endlessly.\nWhen William arrived at the rooftop, he saw a devastated Victoria.\nThe police were talking to her, but Victoria seemed not to hear, her eyes blank and her face as pale as a sheet.\nHe strode over, signaling to the police that he would handle it, then knelt down, his gaze fixed on Victoria, and called softly, \"Victoria?\"\nVictoria's thoughts were a tangled mess, but that familiar voice managed to pierce through the fog and reach her ears.\nShe looked up dazedly, her eyes gradually focusing. When she saw it was him, she grabbed his arm, her voice trembling and tearful. \"Wendy jumped. What do I do? I didn't catch her, I didn't save her.\"\nShe was so lost and helpless, like a child who had lost their way.\nWilliam's lips pressed into a tight line, and he pulled her closer, his eyes full of concern. \"She's not dead.\"\n\"What did you say?\" Victoria couldn't believe it, confirming each word.\n\"The inflatable cushion caught her.\"\nIt took Victoria a moment to process this, and she let out a long breath, her body going limp as she leaned against William, her forehead resting on his chest, murmuring, \"She's okay, thank goodness, she's okay.\"\nAs she spoke, her voice choked up, and she unconsciously tightened her grip on his hand. \"You know, she jumped right in front of me. If something had happened to her, I would never forgive myself.\"\nEven though Wendy had narrowly escaped, the harrowing scene would forever be an indelible shadow in her life.\n\"I know.\" William's brow furrowed, and he gently hugged her.\nHe had been in the area on business and had witnessed the whole ordeal.\nAt this moment, he was more worried about Victoria than Wendy.\nFor years, Victoria had always seemed strong, having faced life's ups and downs too early. But in reality, she wasn't as invincible as others thought.\nOn the contrary, she had just learned to hide her vulnerability, suppressing her emotions.\nVictoria took a long time to calm down and slowly stood up, feeling a bit embarrassed.\n\"Thank you,\" she said softly.\nWilliam looked down, his expression becoming distant and cold. \"No need to thank me. Anyone would have done the same.\"\nVictoria understood.\nHe was subtly telling her he was there for her only because of the situation today, and he didn't want her to get the wrong idea about his intentions.",

She was about to follow Ember but suddenly stopped and turned back. \"I sent the money I owed you for the car repair to Harry.\"\nWilliam pressed his tongue against his teeth, a wry smile forming at the corner of his mouth. \"So, I guess we don't need to see each other anymore.\"\nVictoria didn't respond, just turned around and left with Ember.\nWilliam took a deep breath, letting the strong wind on the rooftop whip around him, as if only this could clear his muddled thoughts.\n\"William, you okay?\" Alice asked, looking at William, who was standing on the rooftop, lost in thought.\nWilliam turned to look at her. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\"\nAlice pursed her lips slightly, her expression a bit uneasy, but she quickly composed herself and asked softly, \"Do you know why your grandfather urgently called us back this time?\"\nWilliam was silent for a moment before speaking slowly. \"Grandpa's in the hospital again.\"\nAlice had already heard this news from Catherine, but she still pretended to be very surprised and asked with concern, \"How's he doing now?\"\n\"His condition's unstable,\" William said, looking up at her. \"Thanks for coming with me this time.\"\nGarth had a poor impression of Alice before, but perhaps due to his serious illness, he had a change of heart and asked William to bring her back to the Scott Manor in Harborview City.\nEven though William didn't fully agree with Garth's decision, he would still do his best to fulfill his grandfather's wishes at a time like this.\n\"William, don't be so formal with me,\" Alice said, her eyes gentle as she gazed at him. \"Besides, your grandfather watched me grow up. In my heart, he's like family.\"\nShe gently held William's hand and said softly, \"Don't worry, I'll stay by your side.\"\nWilliam calmly withdrew his hand from hers and turned to go downstairs.\nFortunately, the hospital wasn't too far, and with proper preparation, Wendy only suffered a fracture and a concussion, with no life-threatening injuries.\nVictoria and her colleagues took turns caring for her, and Diana brought her delicious food every day.\nBut since waking up, Wendy had remained silent.\nCarol visited once, standing coldly and looking at Wendy as if she were a stranger. \"Are you happy now that I've been trashed by netizens?\"\nVictoria's face darkened. \"Wendy needs to rest.\"\nCarol glanced at her without speaking, then turned her gaze back to Wendy, expressionless. \"I've decided to go abroad. I'm leaving in a couple of days. The house is listed with a realtor, and I've packed your things. Someone will bring them to you later.\"\nVictoria looked at her in disbelief. \"You're leaving? What about Wendy? What will she do?\"\nCarol shrugged indifferently. \"What does that have to do with me?\"\nHer indifferent attitude made Victoria furious.\nVictoria could empathize with the pain of being abandoned.\n\"If you feel sorry for her, you can take her in!\" Carol sneered at Victoria. \"Stop pretending to be a good person!\"\nWith that, she grabbed her bag and left.\nVictoria's hands trembled with anger, but there was nothing she could do.\nHow could some parents abandon their children so easily?\nUnder the covers, Wendy's eyes were open, tears silently falling onto the pillow.\nThe next day, Wendy's hospital room was empty.\nThere was only a letter left on the bed.\nVictoria stood at the door for a long time before mustering the courage to pick up the letter.\nJust then, footsteps sounded outside, and Diana arrived.\n\"Where's Wendy?\" Seeing the empty bed, Diana was also stunned.\nVictoria silently read the letter and said softly, \"She's gone.\"\nDiana looked puzzled. \"Where? Home? But that can't be right. Carol sold the house. Where could she go?\"\nVictoria shook her head, looking desolate. \"She's left the city for good.\"\nShe didn't say where Wendy had gone.\nDiana was taken aback and quickly grabbed the letter. \"This is ridiculous! She's not fully recovered. Where could she go alone?\"\nA colleague nearby tried to comfort them. \"Wendy's just in a bad mood. Maybe she just went out to clear her head. She'll be back soon.\"\nBut Victoria didn't think so. She had a feeling Wendy wouldn't return.\nShe looked out the window, feeling a deep sense of loss.\nIt seemed everything had returned to square one.\nVictoria's exam results came out, and she passed the University of Aesthetics Shine entrance exam with the highest score, transitioning from an auditor to a full-fledged student.\nHowever, Samuel, who had given her the pass, was no longer at the school.\nVictoria's life became busier.\nFrom Monday to Friday, she worked at Starry Studio Gallery during the day, attended online video classes at night, and went to school on weekends to attend classes, submit assignments, and write papers. Her days were simple to the point of being monotonous. \nLate at night, the sudden ringing of the phone shattered the silence.\nBefore long, Alvin came to Victoria's room.\n\"It's the hospital.\"\nDespite mentally preparing herself, when the moment truly arrived, Victoria found she was far less composed than she had imagined.\nHer heart pounded erratically.\n\"Get dressed. I'll wait for you downstairs.\" Alvin's voice was low and hoarse.\nThey hurried to the hospital.\nTony was waiting there. When he saw Victoria, he lowered his eyes slightly and said softly, \"Go in and see her.\"\nVictoria's steps faltered before she slowly walked into the hospital room.\nNora lay on the bed, emaciated, her cheeks sunken, and dark circles under her eyes. Hearing the door open, she struggled to open her eyes. \"Is it Bobby?\"\nVictoria bit her lip and stepped forward. \"It's Victoria.\"\n\"Why is it you?\" Nora's voice was weak, and she was so frail that even though she still disliked Victoria, she no longer had the strength to scold or berate her.\n\"Yes, why is it me?\" Victoria's lips curled into a self-deprecating smile. She took a deep breath. \"It's ironic, isn't it? You despise me so much, yet here I am, the one by your side in your final moments. Isn't this your karma?\"\nOn the way here, she had repeatedly told herself to stay calm, no matter what Nora said.\nBut now, she couldn't control her emotions!\nShe couldn't accept that even at the end of her life, Nora's thoughts were still only of Bobby!\nWhat did she mean to Nora?",

I just want you to look at me, but you never have.\" Victoria covered her face, her body trembling uncontrollably. \"Not even once.\"\nOutside the room, Alvin clenched his jaw, his fists tightly balled.\nVictoria's cries were like sharp needles, piercing his old, unhealed wounds.\nInside, Nora's consciousness was fading, and she was unaware of Victoria's outburst.\nAll she knew was that the person in front of her wasn't her Bobby.\n\"Bobby, my dear son, Bobby.\"\nVictoria closed her eyes, tears streaming down her face.\nYes, Bobby.\nIn Nora's heart, there was only ever Bobby.\nPerhaps, even on her deathbed, she wouldn't remember she had a daughter.\nSuddenly, a hand grasped Victoria's.\nStartled, Victoria looked down to meet Nora's slightly open eyes.\nFor a moment, there was clarity in Nora's gaze.\n\"Victoria,\" Nora said slowly, \"do me a favor. Go find Bobby, will you? Bring him here. I want to see him.\"\nVictoria left the room, glanced at Alvin, said nothing, and stepped aside to make a call.\nAlvin stood in silence for a moment before entering the room.\nSoon, Victoria returned.\nNora seemed a bit more alert, even struggling to sit up, her eyes anxiously fixed on the door.\n\"Where's Bobby?\"\nVictoria looked down for a long time before raising her head. \"I couldn't reach him.\"\nAlvin looked at Victoria, his gaze steady for a few seconds before he slowly lowered his head.\n\"You couldn't reach him? What do you mean? That's impossible.\" Nora's previously calm eyes turned frantic again. \"No, it can't be.\"\nVictoria stood across from her, her hands clenched into fists.\n\"No, Bobby!\" Suddenly, Nora coughed up blood.\nDoctors and nurses rushed in, trying every possible method to save her. Finally, Tony stopped, looked at Victoria, and shook his head helplessly.\nVictoria didn't cry.\nShe sat on a bench outside, her hands cold, the surrounding commotion feeling distant.\nAlvin sat beside her. \"You did reach Bobby, didn't you?\"\nAfter a long while, Victoria nodded slightly. \"He refused.\"\nHe wouldn't even come to say goodbye to Nora.\nVictoria and Alvin sat in silence.\nNora's funeral was simple, with few attendees.\nAfterward, Victoria returned to her daily routine.\nTime flew by, and after three years of study, Victoria was about to graduate from the University of Aesthetics Shine.\nIn those three years, she had made a name for herself at Starry Studio Gallery, her performance impressive across the industry.\nDiana had high hopes for her, planning to hand over the management of Starry Studio Gallery to her once she returned to the Simpson Group.\nBut then, Diana's father Hugo Simpson suddenly introduced an illegitimate daughter, Marcella Simpson, who came back from abroad and forcibly took over the gallery's management. Marcella disliked Victoria intensely and often caused her trouble.\nAt first, Victoria didn't understand why Marcella targeted her so much.\nLater, she found out that Marcella was friends with Samuel's fiancée, Hannah, from their college days abroad.\nSamuel and Hannah had been engaged for three years but hadn't married yet.\nDespite the Wright family's constant pressure, Samuel resisted, focusing on his career, wanting to establish himself before settling down.\nThe Wright family had supported the Brown family financially and through connections, especially during a crisis three years ago. They had helped Samuel overcome a significant challenge.\nGiven the Wright family's substantial support, the Brown family was expected to finalize Samuel and Hannah's marriage soon.\nHowever, Samuel was dedicated to his business, believing it wasn't the right time for marriage. He wanted to secure his position first.\nThis caused dissatisfaction within the Wright family.\nFortunately, Hannah always stood by Samuel, understanding his ambitions and speaking on his behalf to her family.\nThough Samuel hadn't given Hannah a grand wedding yet, he was a considerate and romantic boyfriend. He never missed a holiday or anniversary, always preparing thoughtful gifts. When Hannah was unwell, he took care of her attentively, earning praise from her friends.\nEven though they weren't married, everyone around them knew it was only a matter of time.\nThe two families were deeply intertwined in business, making separation difficult.\nThis was why the Wright family tolerated Samuel's delays, hoping he would soon succeed and provide Hannah with a stable future.\nHowever, to Hannah, Victoria was still a thorn in her side.\nEven though Victoria and Samuel had little contact in recent years, Samuel never forgot his promise to provide paintings for Starry Studio Gallery, working in his studio whenever he had time.\nThis made Hannah uncomfortable.\nAs her friend, Marcella naturally disliked Victoria and went out of her way to cause her trouble.",

        "content": "Alvin's company had been growing like crazy over the past few years. Thanks to his sharp eye for architectural trends, a bunch of landmark projects that mixed innovative ideas with human touches had created quite a buzz in the industry as soon as they hit the scene.\nOn top of that, Victoria's incredible talent often brought fresh creative inspiration to the table, helping Alvin's company stand out from the competition.\nIn just a few short years, Alvin's Dreamscape Construction had gone from a little-known firm to one of the top players in the architectural design world.\nVictoria was already a bona fide heiress, but the challenges and trials of the past few years had made her more composed and grounded. The external accolades and vanity that others chased were fleeting in her eyes, never truly capturing her heart.\nAlvin had tried many times to persuade her to quit her job, but Victoria had her own considerations.\nFirst, she hadn't yet graduated from the University of Aesthetics Shine and didn't want to disrupt her current life plans. Second, she had deep emotional ties to Starry Studio Gallery, where she had worked for many years. The thought of leaving that job was something she couldn't bear.\nHer stubborn attitude left Alvin with no choice.\nVictoria was organizing materials for an out-of-town art exchange event at Starry Studio Gallery.\nHer colleague Ember, arms crossed and leaning against the doorframe, frowned and asked, \"Marcella wants you to go with her to the industry exchange event to accept the design award?\"\n\"Yeah.\" Victoria carefully placed a catalog into a box.\n\"How shameless can she be!\" Ember fumed. \"The idea was yours, the design sketches were drawn by you, and even the presentation plan was meticulously prepared by you! What right does she have to take credit for it? And to make it worse, she wants you to accompany her?\"\nVictoria remained calm. \"She's the manager of Starry Studio Gallery, and I'm an employee. It's my job to do more work. For me, every project is a valuable growth opportunity. The experience I gain now will be useful in the future.\"\nEmber shook her head in exasperation. \"You're too forgiving.\"\nVictoria looked up at her and smiled, changing the subject. \"I'm leaving now. Keep an eye on things at the gallery. If there's any problem, contact me right away.\"\nVictoria finished packing her luggage and took a cab to the airport.\nWhen Marcella saw Victoria, her face instantly darkened.\n\"Why are you just getting here?\"\nMarcella looked only a few years older than Victoria, dressed stylishly and exuding the aura of a seasoned professional.\n\"Sorry, there was traffic.\" Victoria didn't offer much explanation and headed straight to the VIP lounge.\n\"Then why didn't you leave earlier?\" Marcella pressed on. \"Victoria, you should know, I could take anyone. There are plenty of people at the gallery eager for this opportunity!\"\n\"Yeah, I get it.\" Victoria was used to her attitude and responded accordingly, then greeted the assistant manager, Terrence Wheeler, who was sitting on the other side.\nTerrence was known for being easygoing and was leading the team to the industry exchange event.\nSeeing Marcella about to continue her tirade, Terrence smiled to ease the tension. \"Marcella, we're not at the office. Don't be too harsh.\"\nNo matter how much Marcella disliked Victoria, she had to show respect to Terrence.\nHe was Hugo's trusted aide, and only his age had led Hugo to assign him simpler tasks at the gallery.\nMarcella's lips curled into a cold smile. \"Since Terrence is speaking up for you, I'll let it go. But you need to be punctual. We can't be waiting for a mere sales assistant!\"\nVictoria nodded, acknowledging her words.\nSoon, the three of them boarded the plane. Terrence and Marcella sat in business class, while Victoria was in economy class.\nWhen booking the tickets, Alvin had offered to get her a first-class seat, but Victoria didn't want to draw attention and booked according to the company's travel policy.\nAfter boarding, Victoria helped Marcella with her luggage, took out her tablet, and settled her in before returning to her own seat.\nTerrence praised her, \"Victoria is great, diligent and reliable.\"\nMarcella, however, said slowly, \"But she's too meticulous, always scheming.\"\nTerrence was taken aback, not understanding her meaning, but didn't ask further, clearly not wanting to get involved in their conflict.\nAs soon as Victoria sat down, she noticed the young girl next to her was engrossed in her phone, looking at unique and exquisite architectural designs.\nThe girl sensed Victoria's gaze and turned to her enthusiastically. \"Do you like architectural design too?\"\n\"I know a bit about it,\" Victoria replied, recognizing the designs from Dreamscape Construction, each one a testament to the company's glory and the designers' hard work.\nThe girl was clearly passionate about architectural design, eagerly sharing her insights on the designs throughout the flight.\nFrom the ingenious spatial layouts to how the exterior harmonized with the surroundings, every detail sparked her deep analysis, and her words were filled with admiration for the buildings.\nVictoria was exhausted, having stayed up late the previous night preparing crucial presentation materials and an acceptance speech for Marcella. Marcella's demands were high; the materials had to be comprehensive and beautifully formatted to showcase the company's professionalism and high-end image perfectly.\nThe acceptance speech had to be unique, making her shine in the news.\nDespite her fatigue, Victoria listened attentively to the girl's enthusiastic sharing.\nIt wasn't until they were about to disembark that the girl reluctantly said goodbye.\nThe three arrived in the destination city, where the Simpson Group had meticulously booked their hotel.\nAs soon as the car stopped, Marcella got out and, looking back at Victoria, imperiously ordered, \"Victoria, carry my luggage inside.\"\nShe then walked into the hotel lobby with an elegant yet haughty stride, immediately putting on a warm smile as she greeted familiar colleagues.\nVictoria quietly took care of the luggage and then went to the front desk to check in.\nMarcella, having finished her chat, headed towards the elevator, still urging, \"Victoria, hurry up.\"\n\"Got it.\" Victoria quickly grabbed the room keys, picked up the luggage, and hurried to the elevator.\nMarcella adjusted her hair, standing in the elevator, and gave Victoria a disdainful look. \"Can't you move any faster?\"\nVictoria didn't respond, pressing the button for their floor.\nJust as the elevator doors were about to close, a hand reached in, causing the doors to slowly reopen.\nThe hand was fair and delicate, with long, well-manicured fingers.\nVictoria's heart skipped a beat as she saw the hand, and she looked up slowly.\nThe man outside the elevator was dressed in a dark suit with a light blue shirt underneath, the top two buttons undone. He was tall and handsome, with features that seemed meticulously sculpted, exuding an irresistible charm.\nEven Marcella, who was used to seeing attractive men, was momentarily stunned, staring at him for a long time.",

        "content": "Victoria instinctively lowered her head and moved closer to the corner after locking eyes with William's cold, intense gaze.\nThree years had passed, and she never imagined their reunion would be so sudden and unexpected.\nWilliam seemed not to recognize her, or maybe he just didn't care. After stepping in, he turned his back to everyone, pressed the elevator button, and casually slipped his hands into his pockets.\nAs the elevator ascended, Victoria's heart felt like it was floating in mid-air, only to crash down heavily, over and over, making it hard for her to breathe.\nThe small space became awkwardly tense.\nMarcella stood diagonally behind William, her eyes unblinking.\n'No wonder Harborview City is so renowned. Even a random guy here is so outstanding,' she thought.\nThis time, she had to make a good impression during the exchange event, hoping to attract more excellent men and find a wealthy boyfriend to outshine that bitch Diana!\nMarcella, always proud and ambitious, rarely met a man who piqued her interest so much. She was itching to get his contact information but was also mindful of her dignity and status.\nCatching a glimpse of Victoria out of the corner of her eye, Marcella decided to make small talk to assert her presence in front of William.\nShe pursed her lips slightly and turned to Victoria, saying, \"The designers attending this exchange event are all industry elites. Since it's your first time here, be smart and don't embarrass our company. Also, did you bring a gown? If not, I have one, but I'm afraid you won't have the grace to pull it off. Just look at your outfit, it's really...\"\nShe smiled without saying more, her disdain evident.\nVictoria bit her lip, her face turning pale.\nIn just a few words, Marcella had elevated herself by belittling Victoria, exposing her situation completely.\nOf course, Victoria knew that these words meant nothing to those who didn't care about her.\nSo if she let it bother her, it would only be her own problem.\nThe elevator arrived, and the doors slowly opened.\nMarcella raised her chin and softly said to William, \"Excuse me, sir, could you please move aside?\"\nEven though she could easily slip past him, she insisted on making William move, her intentions clear to Victoria.\nBut this time, her plan was likely to fail. William wasn't someone who could be easily swayed.\nWilliam slowly glanced sideways, then stepped aside.\nWhether intentionally or not, he ended up standing right in front of Victoria.\nVictoria pressed her lips together, trying to breathe steadily as she dragged her two heavy suitcases past him.\nWilliam's deep eyes narrowed slightly, seemingly indifferent to everything around him. His gaze slowly moved, landing on Victoria's struggling figure.\nThe elevator doors slowly closed.\nVictoria finally let out a heavy sigh of relief.\nShe had thought about meeting William again, but not like this, purely by chance.\nShe had imagined their reunion would be a simple, light-hearted smile.\nWho could have guessed it would be like this, as if they were strangers?\nBut wasn't this exactly what she had hoped for?\n\"What a pity,\" Marcella sighed regretfully beside her. \"He's so handsome and distinguished. It would be great to get to know him.\"\nNoticing Victoria looking at her, Marcella didn't feel embarrassed. She turned and ordered, \"Take my luggage to my room.\"\nVictoria silently pushed the two suitcases, her expression calm on the surface, but her mind in turmoil.\nShe had underestimated William's impact on her. Despite three years of mental preparation, seeing him again easily shattered the facade she had painstakingly built.\nHer room was right next to Marcella's. After returning, Victoria threw herself onto the bed, staring blankly out the window.\nThat evening, there was a banquet.\nThe venue was the hotel's first-floor banquet hall.\nMarcella took this occasion very seriously, dressing up meticulously. Her elegant evening gown accentuated her graceful figure, and she walked with poise, immediately attracting attention as she entered the hall.\nThe designers invited to this exchange event were all industry elites. Female designers were already few, and young, beautiful ones were even rarer.\nThus, Marcella instantly became the center of attention.\nFrom the moment she appeared, compliments and greetings were endless.\nHer smile was radiant, every curve practiced to perfection, clearly aiming to present her best side.\nIn contrast, Victoria was much more casual, wearing a simple professional outfit, her long hair loosely tied back, and a pair of black-framed glasses adding a touch of elegance.\nShe had been busy all day, barely having time to eat. Now, her stomach growled with hunger, and she headed straight for the buffet.\nShe filled a plate with food, looked around, and then carried her tray to a corner by the window, quietly sitting down to eat.\nThe view from the window was excellent, with the city's bustling night scene in full view.\nA gentle breeze brought the warm, pleasant air of early summer, making her feel refreshed.\nTonight's banquet was just a routine event, relatively relaxed with no formalities. Terrence had been called away by a business partner as soon as he arrived at the hotel.\nMarcella seemed busy mingling with acquaintances, leaving Victoria with a rare moment of peace.\nNearby, someone was chatting, \"Do you know Marcella?\"\nHearing the name, Victoria instinctively slowed her eating.\n\"She's quite notorious in our industry! I heard she's an illegitimate child who, along with her mother, drove the wife to suicide to secure a place in the Simpson family.\"\n\"Exactly, with that background, she still struts around arrogantly. It's infuriating.\"\n\"Even though she seems glamorous now, who knows how many people despise her behind her back. Every time I see her acting superior, it makes me angry.\"\nVictoria continued eating quietly, trying to make her movements as silent as possible.\nShe had heard bits and pieces of these rumors before but never delved into them.\nTo her, even if the rumors were true, it was someone else's past and privacy, not something to judge.\nSoon, a sharp scream broke the noise in the hall.\nIt sounded like Marcella.\nVictoria immediately put down her utensils and quickly walked towards the source of the sound.\nMarcella stood in the center of the hall, looking disheveled. Her meticulously styled hair was a mess, her gown stained with wine, and her makeup smeared, making her look utterly embarrassed.\nThe waitstaff hurriedly handed her towels, trying to help clean her up.\nMarcella stood there like a statue, her eyes filled with panic and helplessness.\nLaughter erupted around her, with people covering their mouths to stifle their giggles.\nSome even took out their phones, aiming their cameras at her, ready to capture this \"spectacular\" moment.",

        "content": "Victoria had no clue how the champagne ended up all over Marcella, but now wasn't the time to figure it out.\nShe quickly stepped forward, taking off her jacket as she walked, and draped it over Marcella's shoulders to cover the mess.\nShe didn't want Marcella to become the laughingstock of the party, with people snapping photos for their amusement.\n\"Marcella, let me help you get cleaned up,\" Victoria said.\nMarcella snapped out of her daze, finally noticing the mocking glances around her. She felt utterly humiliated, a mix of shame and anger boiling inside her.\nBut she couldn't lash out in public, so she directed all her fury at Victoria.\n\"Where were you?\" she demanded angrily, yanking the jacket off her shoulders and throwing it to the ground. \"Didn't I tell you not to wander off?\"\nVictoria's eyebrows twitched slightly, a barely noticeable frown forming.\nShe understood that Marcella was trying to save face. After a moment, she lowered her gaze and softly said, \"It was my mistake.\"\n\"I don't even know why I brought you here!\" Marcella continued to berate Victoria as she stormed towards the exit. \"It's all your fault!\"\nClearly, Marcella was used to being pampered, and Victoria felt a wave of helplessness.\nDespite her frustration, Victoria had to bite her tongue and just endure it. If she and Marcella had a public argument, it would tarnish the reputation of Starry Studio Gallery, and she didn't want her beloved gallery to become a joke.\nOnce they were outside the banquet hall, Marcella still wouldn't let up, her righteous indignation making it seem like everything was Victoria's fault.\n\"Where did you go?\" Marcella asked again, her tone harsh.\n\"I was hungry, so I got something to eat,\" Victoria answered honestly.\n\"You're such a glutton!\" Marcella snapped, her words cutting. \"At a time like this, you have the nerve to eat? Don't you know why you're here?\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes and calmly corrected her, \"I'm an employee of the gallery, not anyone's servant.\"\nThough their tasks often overlapped, there was a fundamental difference between the two roles.\nMarcella let out a cold laugh. \"You won't be for much longer.\"\nFor the first time, Victoria looked up at her, her gaze icy and resolute, sending a chill through the air.\nVictoria's lips curled into a slight smile. \"So, what are you planning to do?\"\n\"What am I planning?\" Marcella's lips twisted into a mocking smile as she headed towards the dressing room. \"You'll find out soon enough.\"\nIt was both a warning and a threat.\nVictoria stood still, her beautiful face calm and emotionless.\nShe wasn't afraid of whatever scheme Marcella might come up with. At worst, she would leave Starry Studio Gallery.\n\"What are you standing there for? Come upstairs and help me change!\" Marcella urged.\nThe dressing room was conveniently located upstairs.\nVictoria hesitated for a couple of seconds before following Marcella up the stairs.\nOnce the hallway was quiet, the two men behind the door began to speak.\n\"William, do you know her?\" the younger man asked in a hushed voice.\nFrom the moment the commotion started outside, he had noticed William's unusual reaction. William's expression was cold, his eyes filled with a chilling intensity that made him seem unapproachable.\nLeaning against the wall with his hands deep in his pockets, William's eyes were narrowed, making it hard to read his emotions.\nBut those who knew him well understood that he was exuding a \"stay away\" vibe.\nWilliam's lips curled into a cold smile. \"How could I possibly know someone like that?\"\nSomeone like that? What did he mean by that?\nCassius was puzzled, completely in the dark.\nHe knew William was usually aloof, but this was unusually harsh, especially considering the girl outside seemed to be the one wronged.\n\"Let's go.\"\nClearly irritated and impatient, William turned and headed back to the banquet hall.\nCassius, who had sneaked out behind his parents' backs, quickly followed. \"William, do you really not know her?\"\nWilliam shot him a frosty glare, and Cassius promptly shut his mouth.\n\"Fine, won't ask then. What's the big deal?\" he grumbled.\nStill, given William's reaction, it was hard to believe he didn't know her.\nAs soon as William entered the banquet hall, a small stir went through the crowd. Delmar Puckett, the host and the big boss behind the event, personally greeted him with a broad smile, introducing him to various business partners and friends.\nWilliam merely nodded in acknowledgment, his face showing little interest.\nOnly Cassius noticed that William's gaze kept drifting towards the door.\nCassius's eyes lit up as if he had discovered something significant. Could it be that a woman had caught William's attention? He was eager to find out who she was.\nSoon, Victoria returned with Marcella, who had changed into another eye-catching dress, this time a striking red gown with a floor-length skirt adorned with sparkling sequins that shimmered under the lights.\nMarcella had a tenacious spirit; she was determined to regain her dignity right where she had lost it.\nVictoria was slightly taken aback by Marcella's bold choice, but Marcella, head held high, confidently re-entered the banquet hall.\nVictoria couldn't help but admire her. If it were her, she might not have had such a positive attitude.\nAs expected, Marcella quickly became the center of attention again.\nVictoria, not wanting to draw too much attention, kept a distance and headed to the lounge area to sit down.\nMarcella immediately spotted Delmar, her smile perfectly poised as she approached him. \"Mr. Puckett, do you remember me? I'm Marcella from Starry Studio Gallery.\"\nAt the mention of \"Starry Studio Gallery,\" the man standing next to Delmar slowly turned his head.\nMarcella instantly recognized him as the striking man from the elevator earlier.\nHer smile grew even brighter. \"Mr. Puckett, who is this?\"\nDelmar introduced him with a smile. \"This is Mr. Scott from the Scott Group.\"\nWilliam gave a slight nod, his gaze quickly shifting away.\n\"Mr. Scott, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Marcella, the manager of Starry Studio Gallery.\" Marcella was thrilled, feeling like this was a golden opportunity.\n\"Mm-hmm.\" William took a sip of his drink.\nMarcella, overjoyed, eagerly raised her glass of champagne. \"Mr. Scott, a toast to you.\"\nWilliam barely lifted his glass, not even sparing her a glance.\nHe seemed to be casually scanning the room, but when his eyes landed on a figure in the corner, he frowned slightly.\nMarcella tried to continue the conversation. \"Mr. Scott...\"\n\"Excuse me.\" William set down his glass and headed straight for the corner.",

        "content": "Cassius was leaning against a pillar, his eyes locked on someone across the room, curiosity written all over his face.\nOut of nowhere, someone smacked him on the head.\nHe spun around, startled, and grumbled, \"William! You almost knocked me out!\"\n\"What are you staring at?\" William asked, glancing at him with a hint of indifference.\n\"Nothing,\" Cassius replied, still peering across the room with a sly grin. \"By the way, you really don't know that lady?\"\nWilliam finally lifted his gaze, his deep eyes reflecting a figure he knew all too well.\n\"Looks like she's in a bit of trouble,\" Cassius said, clearly enjoying the drama, while watching William's reaction.\nWilliam's face remained as cold as ice, showing no emotion.\nAcross the room, someone had stopped Victoria. \"Miss, haven't we met somewhere before?\"\nThe man, in his forties, was dressed in a sharp suit, his hair meticulously styled.\nVictoria, trying to be patient, replied, \"I'm sorry, you must be mistaken.\"\n\"No, no, I'm sure we've met!\"\nThe man brazenly looked her up and down, even circling around her exaggeratedly. \"Let me think, where could it have been?\"\nVictoria's face darkened, her eyes avoiding his. \"You have the wrong person.\"\nShe was deliberately avoiding attention. Despite her efforts to keep a low profile, her work had garnered significant attention in the industry, and Dreamscape Construction's recent news had been widely covered. Given the company's reputation, it wasn't impossible for someone to recognize her.\nAs she tried to walk away, the man suddenly grabbed her arm. \"Wait, I remember now!\"\nVictoria took a deep breath, turned around, and tried to remove his hand. \"Sir, whether you remember or not is none of my concern. I'm not interested. Now, let go.\"\nThe man ignored her displeasure, still acting smug. \"I know who you are. You're...\"\nJust as Victoria was about to forcefully shake him off, someone suddenly grabbed the man's hand tightly.\n\"Ow!\" The man winced in pain, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.\nVictoria stared in shock at the person who had appeared.\nWilliam, his face expressionless, didn't even glance at her. He just stared coldly at the man. \"Which company are you from? Do all your employees behave so rudely?\"\nHis tone was severe. The man, unsure of William's identity but noticing the growing attention from onlookers, couldn't afford to lose face and refused to back down easily.\n\"We're in the same industry, just having a normal conversation,\" the man argued.\nWilliam had no patience for his nonsense. Without another word, he flung the man aside.\nThe man stumbled, his face flushing with anger. He rolled up his sleeves and charged forward. \"What the hell...\"\n\"What's going on here?\" Delmar, noticing the commotion, hurried over to inquire.\nSeeing his boss personally involved, the man's arrogance vanished, and he stood obediently in front of Delmar.\nBefore he could explain, William impatiently said, \"If this is the quality of your company's designers, then consider our collaboration canceled.\"\nDelmar's eyes widened. He turned and scolded the man, \"Look at the mess you've made! Apologize to Mr. Scott immediately!\"\nThe man, realizing he couldn't afford to offend anyone, was about to say \"I'm sorry\" when William interjected, \"You should apologize to her, not me.\"\nDelmar reacted quickly, glaring at the man, \"Yeah, go apologize to the lady right away!\"\n\"Okay, okay.\" The man quickly turned to Victoria. \"Miss, I'm really sorry, I mistook you for someone else.\"\nDespite his words, his eyes still held a hint of resentment.\nVictoria's thoughts were entirely on William, her heart pounding. She couldn't tell if she was more shocked or delighted.\nMarcella, who had been observing, found the situation increasingly puzzling.\nHer gaze shifted between Victoria and William. What was going on? How could someone like William, the head of Harborview City's leading enterprise, be involved in such a trivial matter?\nAnd the way he looked at Victoria was unusual.\nCould they know each other?\nBut how was that possible?\nVictoria was just a small-time gallery employee. How could she know someone like William?\nMarcella scrutinized Victoria again, finding the idea absurd. William was surrounded by women, and even if he were to choose, it wouldn't be someone like Victoria-plainly dressed and always buried in work.\nFeeling reassured, Marcella's lips curled into a smile, like a spectator enjoying the show.\nVictoria didn't want to escalate the situation. After all, she represented Starry Studio Gallery.\nSo, she accepted the man's apology and explained, \"It's okay;, it's easy to mistake someone in a crowd.\"\nShe wanted to resolve the matter quickly, but William, seeing her so accommodating, felt a twinge of displeasure.\nAs the man slunk away, William turned to Delmar, his expression stern. \"People like that will ruin your company's reputation.\"\nDelmar, ever the diplomat, quickly understood. \"Don't worry, Mr. Scott. He won't be working for us anymore.\"\nVictoria frowned slightly. The man's behavior was inappropriate, but it didn't warrant losing his job.\nShe was about to speak up when William said to Delmar, \"By the way, about the project plans for the second half of the year, could you elaborate?\"\nDelmar, all smiles, nodded eagerly. \"Of course, Mr. Scott. Let's find a place to discuss.\"\n\"Sure.\" William followed Delmar, not sparing Victoria another glance.\nVictoria watched his retreating figure, her emotions in turmoil.\nShe knew he was doing it on purpose.\nBut she couldn't blame him. William was always proud, and she had deeply hurt that pride.\n\"Do you know him?\" Marcella approached.\nVictoria shook her head lightly. \"He's the CEO of the Scott Group. How could I know him?\"\n\"Before this, he was quite the figure in Silvermist City.\"\nMarcella looked her over. \"You must have heard of him.\"\n\"Marcella, you know, just hearing about someone doesn't mean you know them.\"\nVictoria clearly didn't want to continue the conversation. She turned to leave, but Marcella chuckled softly. \"I'm curious what that unlucky guy did to provoke Mr. Scott.\"\nVictoria lowered her eyes and walked to the nearby lounge area.\nShe never liked these social events, always feeling out of place. She had never even attended Dreamscape Construction's annual parties.\nAs soon as she sat down, someone joined her.\nVictoria turned, puzzled, to see a young man beside her.\nWith so many empty seats around, it was hard to believe he sat next to her by coincidence. But she said nothing, turning her gaze away.\nAfter all, it was his choice. She had no reason to overthink it.\n\"I'm Cassius Scott. What's your name?\" Cassius broke the silence.\nScott?\nVictoria looked at him more closely, noticing the resemblance to William, especially around the eyes.\nShe had a guess. \"I'm Victoria Carter. Are you Mr. Scott's cousin?\"\n\"That's right. And you, Ms. Carter? Are you William's ex-girlfriend?\"",

Then why did I see your picture on William's phone?\" Cassius lowered his voice on purpose, leaning in closer to make sure she heard him.\nVictoria was taken aback. He had her picture on his phone?\nIn that moment of surprise, a shadow loomed over her.\nShe instinctively looked up, meeting William's deep, dark eyes. Her heart skipped a beat, and she quickly averted her gaze.\nWithout a word, William grabbed Cassius by the collar and yanked him away.\n\"William! William, let go! Everyone's watching! You said you didn't know her, but the moment I got close, you freaked out. So, tell me, are you...\"\nHis voice faded as he was dragged away.\nVictoria took a deep breath, trying to calm herself.\nEver since she met him, she had been acting out of character, and she hated feeling so out of control.\nTonight was just an informal dinner, so Victoria decided to head back to her room to rest. She got up and walked towards the door.\nOnce she left the banquet hall, the inexplicable agitation in her heart began to subside.\nShe let out a self-deprecating smile.\nAfter all this time, she thought she had managed her feelings well, but his presence made her feel like a fool.\nThe more she denied her feelings for him, the more ridiculous it seemed now.\nThe elevator doors opened, and she stepped inside.\nJust then, someone followed her in. She turned around and froze, quickly looking away, pretending not to see him.\nWilliam glanced at her, then turned to press the floor button. \"Which floor?\"\nIt took Victoria a moment to realize he was talking to her. \"12th floor, thanks.\"\n\"Thanks?\" William scoffed, turning his head to scrutinize her. \"Victoria, do you know how fake you've become?\"\nVictoria's brow furrowed, a flash of displeasure crossing her face.\nShe quickly put on a distant smile, as if they were strangers. \"Really? I think I'm doing okay.\"\nWilliam stared at her, stepping closer. Victoria's expression changed, and she pressed herself against the wall, eyes full of caution. \"There's a camera here.\"\nHe raised an eyebrow, his expression a mix of amusement and mockery. \"What are you afraid of? That I still have feelings for you? Or that I'll do something to you here?\"\n\"I'm not.\"\nVictoria realized she had overreacted, feeling a bit self-conscious.\n\"Or do you think that after three years, I haven't found someone to replace you?\" he added.\nVictoria looked up sharply, her gaze heavy. \"Mr. Scott, these are none of my concern Honestly, I didn't expect to see you here. Sorry if I upset you. Please don't hold it against a lowly employee like me.\"\nWilliam stared at her, a mocking smile playing on his lips. \"You still talk as annoyingly as ever. No, you're even more annoying now.\"\nVictoria bit her lip. She had a temper too, and she hadn't provoked him. Yet here he was, picking a fight!\nShe was fuming inside, and her attitude naturally wasn't great. \"In that case, Mr. Scott, you should stay far away from me to avoid getting angry and hurting yourself.\"\nLooking at her face, which hadn't changed much in three years, William squinted his eyes and took another step forward, staring at her. \"Is this really what you want to say to me after three years?\"\n\"What else?\" Victoria shot back, \"What should I say?\"\n\"Yeah, what should you say?\" William took a deep breath, his eyes growing darker. \"I also want to know, what do you have to say to me?\"\nVictoria looked up at him, staring straight into his deep eyes.\nShe pressed her lips together, silent for a moment.\nUntil the elevator doors opened again, she finally spoke slowly. \"What do you want to hear?\"\nWilliam glanced at her, then decisively closed the elevator doors, and it continued to rise.\n\"What do I want to hear?\" He shook his head, a bitter smile on his lips. Suddenly, he placed one hand on the wall behind her. \"You don't know?\"\nHe really wanted to question her harshly!\nShe knew everything but still pretended to be indifferent.\nVictoria turned her head, avoiding his gaze, her voice low. \"Mr. Scott, we are from two different worlds.\"\nWilliam gritted his teeth, then laughed. \"Since you say so, I won't force it. Honestly, I quite like your body. Out of all the women, only you fit me the best, and you're the hardest to forget.\"\nVictoria's face changed slightly, but she said nothing.\n\"But this kind of thing should be consensual. Forcing it is no fun.\" He put one hand in his pocket and casually tidied her slightly messy hair with the other. \"After all, we are old acquaintances. If you have any needs, just ask. Of course, you know the price.\"\nVictoria's patience finally snapped. She angrily swatted his hand away. \"No need. I'm not the little girl who begged for charity anymore. Save your money for someone else!\"\nShe pushed him away and quickly pressed the button for the nearest floor, ready to leave.\nWilliam slowly approached her from behind, his unique scent enveloping her. \"Don't be so quick to refuse. You might need me someday.\"\nVictoria glanced at him coldly. \"Rest assured, that will never happen!\"\nThe elevator doors opened, and she walked out without looking back.\nAs the doors closed, the playful look on William's face faded, replaced by frustration. His cold gaze could freeze anything in an instant!\nFine, very good!\nAfter all this time, she was still so calm!\nForget it! A heartless woman like her wasn't worth it!\nThe day after the dinner, there was an annual networking event.\nMarcella attended as usual, dressed to impress in a champagne gold mermaid gown with a thigh-high slit. Every step she took revealed her slender legs, and the elegant dress highlighted her delicate collarbones and sexy shoulders. The backless design added a touch of allure.\nShe was undoubtedly the center of attention. Female designers showcasing their work at such important events were rare, and she was both young and beautiful.\nMarcella found her reserved front-row seat and sat down. Colleagues immediately gathered around to chat.\n\"Ms. Simpson, your project last month was absolutely stunning.\"\nMarcella was in high spirits, covering her mouth with a light laugh. \"You're too kind.\"\nVictoria entered the exhibition hall, feeling dizzy.\nShe had trouble sleeping last night, and the unfamiliar climate made her feel unwell.\nShe spent the night running to the bathroom, exhausted and pale in the morning, feeling weak all over.",

        "content": "As a junior employee, she could only snag a seat in the back row of the audience.\nAfter finding an empty spot, she leaned back and closed her eyes, hoping the event would wrap up soon so she could head back to her room and rest.\nDelmar took the stage, officially kicking off the event.\nVictoria's head felt heavy, and the host's voice seemed distant and muffled.\nIt wasn't until Marcella took the stage, greeted by thunderous applause, that Victoria was jolted awake. She forced her eyes open and looked toward the center of the stage.\nMarcella, with her elegant demeanor, began with a thank-you speech, then launched into a detailed account of her unique creativity and the challenges she overcame to present the award-winning piece.\nVictoria, exhausted, closed her eyes again.\nMaybe Marcella's confidence was too overwhelming, or the atmosphere too lively, but the host decided to add an impromptu Q&A session.\nMarcella's previously triumphant expression faltered for a moment but quickly returned to her charming smile. \"Sure,\" she said cheerfully.\nThe audience, full of industry peers, was very supportive. Someone immediately raised a hand and asked, \"Ms. Simpson, your design concept is incredibly innovative. How did you get the inspiration to blend traditional elements with modern style so seamlessly?\"\n\"Well, at that time, I...\" Marcella maintained her polite smile, but inside, she was panicking. \nThis project was from months ago, and she barely remembered the details. Many of the creative ideas had come from Victoria. How was she supposed to answer this suddenly?\nBut Marcella was quick on her feet. Smiling, she said into the microphone, \"Such a basic question. I'll let my assistant answer it.\"\nThen, pretending to be playful, she added, \"Come on, ask me something more challenging!\"\nThe host began looking for Victoria. \"Ms. Simpson, where is your assistant?\"\nMarcella raised her voice, \"Victoria? Come on up.\"\nTo the audience, it seemed like she was giving her assistant a chance to shine. Who wouldn't praise her for being so considerate?\nVictoria slowly stood up, her face pale. She stared at Marcella. Others might not notice, but she could see the warning in Marcella's eyes despite her smile.\nVictoria remained calm. She believed she was just doing her job. When she learned Marcella would represent Starry Studio Gallery to accept the award, she didn't mind. She certainly wouldn't expose Marcella now.\nBut she felt so unwell that she had to pinch her palm hard to stay alert.\nTaking the microphone from the host, Victoria clearly explained the design concept, the source of inspiration, and the integration process.\nShe even answered potential follow-up questions in detail.\nSomeone started clapping, and soon the whole room erupted in applause.\nEven Delmar, sitting in the audience, nodded in approval.\nIf even a junior employee could explain things so clearly, it showed that Starry Studio Gallery was truly full of talent!\nMarcella kept smiling, but she was furious inside. She had only asked Victoria to answer a simple question. Who told her to go on and on?\nNow it seemed like Victoria was trying to make it clear that most of the credit for the project belonged to her, not Marcella!\nVictoria didn't plan to stay on stage. Seeing that the host had more questions, she bowed slightly to the audience and turned to leave.\nBut after a few steps, she seemed to remember something and turned back.\nMarcella's smile froze again. She glared at Victoria and whispered, \"What are you doing?\"\nVictoria ignored her, picked up the microphone, and said firmly, \"Just to clarify, I'm not Ms. Simpson's assistant. I'm a full-time employee at Starry Studio Gallery.\"\nShe then put down the microphone and walked off the stage steadily.\nDelmar smiled, his eyes following Victoria. He turned to the person next to him and said, \"This young lady is interesting.\"\nMarcella stood on stage with a forced smile. She was supposed to be the star, but Victoria had stolen the spotlight!\nThe original plan was to return in three days, but Marcella showed no intention of leaving. Terrence, busy with work, had to return to Silvermist City first.\nVictoria had planned to go back with Terrence, but Marcella insisted she stay.\n\"Victoria, you need to remember, you're working for me,\" Marcella said casually while painting her nails. \"I still have some loose ends to tie up here, and I need your help.\"\nVictoria saw Terrence off downstairs. Terrence had a good impression of her and gave her some advice before leaving. \"Marcella's dad is our boss. Just go along with what she says. Don't oppose her. She's just a bit spoiled.\"\n\"I understand. Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.\"\nAfter Terrence's car drove away, Victoria stood there for a long time before slowly looking away.\nShe wasn't afraid of Marcella's pettiness. The real reason she didn't want to stay was William.\n\"Victoria?\" A voice called from behind.\nVictoria turned to see a tall, handsome young man standing there. Despite the maturity and worldliness that time had added to his face, his innate vitality was still evident.\nVictoria instantly recognized him. It was Alton.\nYears ago, Victoria had met him while working on a home exhibition project for the Bridges Group in Silvermist City.\nBack then, Alton was cheerful and wealthy, a golden boy in everyone's eyes.\nAlton had fallen for Victoria at first sight and publicly confessed his feelings, which led to his ex-girlfriend Sofia injuring Victoria.\nWilliam had intervened, and the Moore family had apologized and compensated Victoria, preventing Sofia from being sent to jail.\nLater, Victoria was sent by the gallery to Harborview City to work on another exhibition for the Bridges Group, where she worked with Alton again for a while.\nAfter that project, Victoria hadn't seen him again. She had only heard that the Bridges Group's investments had failed, their funds had dried up, and they had declared bankruptcy two years ago.\nAlton had gone from a carefree rich kid to an ordinary young man working hard in the corporate world.\nVictoria hadn't expected to run into him here.\n\"Victoria, what a coincidence! I can't believe I ran into you here!\"\nAlton looked genuinely happy. \"How about we find a place to sit and catch up?\"\nVictoria didn't want to go back upstairs to face Marcella, so she agreed and followed him to the hotel's lounge.\n\"So, you're here for the exchange event?\" Alton asked.\n\"Yeah, accompanying our gallery manager.\"\nAlton sighed. \"Honestly, I admire you. You've stuck to your dreams all these years, not letting anything distract you.\"\nVictoria smiled and looked at him. \"Where are you working now?\"\nAlton pulled a business card from his pocket.\n\"You're the Sales Director at the Scott family's Infinity Unity Group?\"",

        "content": "\"Yeah, ever since my family had that mess, I joined Infinity Unity Group.\"\nVictoria had a sudden thought. \"Was it William who got you in?\"\nHe chuckled. \"You never miss a beat, do you? Your intuition's still sharp.\"\nVictoria was a bit surprised. \"He got you into his family's company?\"\nAlton's smile was faint, his gaze intense. \"Technically, it's his uncle Wayne who runs Infinity Unity Group. As for why, I think you can figure it out, right?\"\nVictoria had indeed guessed, but she hadn't realized he'd planted this seed years ago.\nAlton didn't hold back and spoke openly. \"My family hit a crisis, and I lost all support. I had to start from scratch. Even though I graduated from a top university, the competition was brutal, and my family was drowning in debt. My parents' health wasn't great either.\"\nHis tone was calm, like he was finally letting out long-held feelings.\n\"I reached out to a lot of relatives and friends, but none of them were willing to help.\"\nVictoria listened quietly, sighing softly.\nShe knew all too well the coldness of the world.\nAlton's smile was bitter. \"In the end, it was Mr. Scott who helped me. He paid off my debts and covered my parents' medical bills. I owe him everything. I swore I'd do anything for him, no matter the cost.\"\nVictoria listened in silence for a long time before asking, \"Why are you telling me this?\"\n\"Aren't you his girl?\"\nAlton's matter-of-fact tone annoyed Victoria. \"There's nothing between us. Don't jump to conclusions.\"\n\"No relationship? That's hard to believe.\" Alton seemed to realize something and smiled. \"Did you two have a fight? It's normal for couples to argue sometimes.\"\nVictoria let out a mocking laugh. \"Have you ever seen a couple stay mad at each other for three years?\"\nAlton was stunned. \"So, you haven't seen each other in three years?\"\n\"There was no need to.\" Victoria lowered her head and took a sip of tea.\n\"That's really interesting.\" Alton leaned forward slightly, looking at her with great interest. \"I remember when I drove you back to the hotel, Mr. Scott looked like he wanted to kill me! And you say there's nothing between you two now.\"\nVictoria didn't respond to his diversion.\nAlton chuckled. \"You've been apart for so long. Want me to fill you in on what's been happening these years?\"\n\"No need.\" Victoria took another sip of tea. \"We've moved on.\"\n\"I'm afraid that's just your wishful thinking.\"\nVictoria frowned. \"What do you mean?\"\nAlton looked at her with a mix of amusement and sympathy. \"You really don't understand this man, do you? I bet you've been single these past few years, right?\"\nVictoria retorted loudly, \"I have plenty of admirers!\"\nAlton shook his head with a smile. \"I don't even have to think about it. Did all those admirers disappear after confessing their feelings to you?\"\n\"How do you know?\" Victoria's eyes widened in shock, staring at Alton in disbelief.\nAlton's smile grew even brighter.\nHe took a slow sip of his tea before continuing. \"When you were working at our exhibition hall, a lot of people were interested in you. But Mr. Scott scared them all away, and you had no idea.\"\nVictoria's eyes widened even more, unable to believe it. \"Are you saying that William has been...\"\n\"Yes!\" Alton said firmly. \"Otherwise, with your looks and abilities, how could you have stayed single all these years? The only reason things have been peaceful between you two is because no one around you has made him feel threatened. If someone did, your life wouldn't be so calm!\"\nVictoria's frown deepened. She hated to think she was being presumptuous.\nBut what he said made some sense.\nAlton watched Victoria. She had become even more captivating over the years, losing some of her youthful naivety and gaining a mature charm.\nAt this moment, her slightly confused look made her even more endearing. He instinctively raised his hand to touch her head.\nBut halfway there, he snapped back to reality and pulled his hand back.\nHe almost made a huge mistake!\nHe almost crossed William's line!\nHe remembered when he first joined Infinity Unity Group. William could have helped him with connections, but instead, he let him struggle at the bottom, enduring many hardships.\nAt first, he thought it was a test. Later, he realized it might have been a form of punishment for daring to covet someone he shouldn't have.\nVictoria looked at Alton, who was now smiling helplessly.\nHis thoughts were written all over his face.\nIt was because of his trust and closeness to her that he didn't use the usual workplace pretense with her.\nVictoria stared at him for a while before suddenly speaking. \"Stop overthinking.\"\nThen, she said firmly, \"There's nothing between him and me, not the kind of relationship you're thinking of.\"\nAlton smiled. \"It doesn't matter what kind of relationship it is. I've just realized one thing: to succeed, you need to align yourself with powerful forces.\"\nVictoria frowned. \"Alton, have you been completely assimilated by the system?\"\nAlton nodded and added seriously, \"Completely assimilated.\"\nAt that moment, Alton's phone rang.\nHe glanced at the caller ID, and his smile widened. \"Perfect timing.\"\nHe answered the call, immediately adopting a respectful tone. \"Mr. Scott.\"\nVictoria was startled and looked up at him.\n\"Yes, that's right. You're correct. Okay, I understand.\"\nHe hung up the phone and said with some helplessness, \"I have to go. Duty calls.\"\n\"I'll walk you out.\" Victoria followed him out of the lounge. As they reached the lobby, someone called her name.\n\"Victoria?\" Marcella, now wearing a flirty short dress, sauntered over.\nShe immediately noticed Alton, her eyes scanning him up and down.\nThen, she smiled.\nVictoria felt a headache coming on.\nAs Marcella approached, Victoria leaned close to Alton and whispered, \"You can still leave now.\"\nAlton, who had worked his way up from the bottom over the years, could tell what kind of person Marcella was at a glance.\nThis type of woman was the most troublesome.\nHe quickly nodded to Victoria. \"I'm out of here.\"\nWith that, he strode towards the door, where his car was already waiting.\n\"Was that your friend? Why did he leave?\" Marcella looked towards the door, noting Alton's attire and the car he got into, clearly impressed.",

        "content": "Marcella's eyes gleamed with a cunning light as she scanned the room. \"This city's got a lot of hidden gems, doesn't it?\"\nVictoria stayed silent. Marcella turned to her, \"Victoria, you seem to know a lot of folks around here. Are they all your friends? That guy just now, so cheerful and stylish, he doesn't seem like an ordinary person.\"\nVictoria looked up and replied calmly, \"The gallery sent me here for work before. He was a colleague back then.\"\nMarcella narrowed her eyes, \"Oh, I see. So, what's he up to now? You must know.\"\nVictoria shook her head, \"We haven't seen each other in years. We just had a quick chat.\"\nMarcella's interest faded, and she pouted, \"You really missed out on a good opportunity.\"\nVictoria pressed her lips together and stayed quiet.\n\"I've got plans tonight.\" With a graceful wave, Marcella swayed her hips and left.\nVictoria just wanted to get some sleep. She hadn't been feeling well these past few days, probably due to the intense workload and constant stress.\nNow that she had a moment to relax, all the accumulated fatigue hit her at once. She had a low-grade fever and felt weak all over.\nShe shook her head, trying to stay awake, but as soon as she stepped into the elevator, a wave of dizziness overwhelmed her.\nShe struggled to breathe, gasping for air, but it didn't help.\nAs the elevator ascended, Victoria felt lightheaded and lost control, falling forward and hitting her head against the elevator door with a loud thud.\nThe ongoing project meeting was interrupted by a sudden, urgent phone ring.\n\"Hello, this is the hospital. Are you Victoria Carter's family?\"\nWilliam, who had been focused on the meeting with a stern expression, stood up abruptly and walked quickly towards the door, \"I am.\"\nHe gestured for his assistant, Carl Ward, to take over the meeting.\nAfter listening to the caller, William's deep eyes narrowed, and he spoke urgently, \"I'll be there right away.\"\nSoon, William appeared outside the hospital room.\n\"She's just overworked and not used to the environment here. It's nothing serious. She just needs to rest and recover.\"\nHearing the doctor's words, William finally breathed a sigh of relief.\nHe walked quietly into the room and looked at Victoria lying on the bed. Her face was as pale as paper, and her breathing was light and weak.\nShe was curled up under the white blanket, looking especially small and fragile.\nWilliam's face darkened inexplicably. He stood by the bed for a moment, then pulled up a chair and sat down slowly.\nShe had only been here for a short time and had already ended up in the hospital. She really didn't know how to take care of herself.\nVictoria slept deeply and for a long time, dreaming of many chaotic things.\nShe dreamed of her family going on a rare outing together, filled with laughter and warmth;\nShe dreamed of her friend Wendy, reuniting after a long time, and Victoria excitedly asked her about her life over the years.\nFinally, she dreamed of William.\nIn the dream, he was like a cold, distant iceberg, exuding an aura that kept people at bay. Just standing there and staring at her from afar made her feel a chill and break out in a cold sweat.\n\"No, don't look at me like that. I... I'm not afraid,\" she murmured in her sleep.\nVictoria woke up suddenly, sitting up in a panic.\nWhen she took in her surroundings, Victoria realized she was in a hospital room.\nShe raised her hand to rub her head, wincing as a sharp pain shot through her forehead.\n\"Careful, you've got a bump there.\"\nThe deep voice startled Victoria. She turned to see William sitting nearby.\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\"The hospital called, asking if I was your family.\"\nVictoria felt her face flush with embarrassment. \"Sorry, they didn't know the situation.\"\n\"What I'm curious about is how the hospital got my number and why they were so sure I was your relative.\"\nVictoria's face grew even hotter, and she mumbled, \"I just changed your contact name.\"\n\"Really?\"\nHe seemed intrigued, asking slowly, \"What did you change it to? Dad? Brother?\"\n\"Of course not!\" She cleared her throat, her voice barely audible, \"Honey.\"\nAs soon as she said it, she wished she could disappear.\nWilliam was clearly taken aback, then looked at her in disbelief, staring intently, \"What did you save it as?\"\nVictoria was so embarrassed she wanted to flee, regretting her words.\n\"You heard me.\" Her voice was still as soft as a whisper.\nWilliam suddenly smiled, then slowly walked over to her, his usual intense gaze roaming over her, \"Honey?\"\nVictoria felt her face was hot enough to fry an egg.\n\"Don't you remember?\" Victoria bit her lip, looking down to avoid his gaze, \"You made me change it after that time.\"\nWilliam paused, then remembered he had indeed forced Victoria to change his contact name.\nHe smirked, his smile devilishly charming.\nAll these years, she hadn't deleted him or changed it back.\nHe narrowed his eyes, a playful look in them, nodding slightly, \"So, since I made you do it, why didn't you change 'Honey' back? Couldn't bear to?\"\nVictoria knew he was doing this on purpose!\nHe repeated \"Honey\" over and over, clearly trying to embarrass her to the extreme!\nFinally, Victoria decided to just go for it.\nShe said, \"I just wanted to get through these years peacefully, without being bothered by boring people. So, whenever someone asked for my number or wouldn't leave me alone, I'd show them that contact name.\"\nShe continued, \"The reason I saved your number is because it looked like an unused number, and changing the contact name didn't feel weird. I didn't plan on contacting you anyway.\"\nWilliam listened, his expression unreadable.\n\"I see. So, for you, that contact name was just a way to avoid harassment?\"\nVictoria thought for a moment, then replied nonchalantly, \"If you want to see it that way, sure.\"\nWilliam's gaze on her grew colder. \"Never contact again, what do you mean?\"\n\"Exactly what it sounds like.\"\nAt this point, she had nothing to hide. \"You're here now, and you probably won't go back to Silvermist City. I have my own life, and I'm quite happy with it. I don't plan on leaving. We're probably completely done now. I'm satisfied with my current state, so why would I call you?\"\nWilliam didn't speak, just stared at her without blinking.\nVictoria avoided his gaze, \"I'm just stating the facts.\"\nWilliam was silent for a long time before nodding slowly, \"You're right.\"\nHis attitude was much colder than before, his eyes distant, \"How could I forget, you always kept your life and feelings separate. To you, I might just be a memory.\"",

        "content": "\"It's history,\" Victoria corrected quickly.\nWilliam took a deep breath, trying to calm the storm inside him.\nHe soon smiled again. \"Alright then, let's settle the score.\"\nVictoria eyed him warily. \"Settle what score? I already repaid you for your help.\"\nShe clearly remembered the days she helped him with his projects. Was he just part of her past now?\nWilliam's eyes darkened.\n\"I've always said my time is valuable, charged by the second. I wasn't exaggerating, was I?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"I interrupted an important meeting and rushed here. How do you plan to make up for my loss?\"\n\"Name your price.\" Victoria thought this was fair enough.\nWilliam narrowed his eyes and chuckled softly. \"The projects you worked on must have been pretty profitable, right? You must have made a lot of money.\"\nHe was right. With Alvin's industry connections, Victoria's annual income was quite substantial. Despite her modest spending habits, she was actually quite wealthy.\n\"But I'm not looking for financial compensation.\" William got straight to the point. \"Infinity Unity Group needs a display designer.\"\nVictoria looked at him skeptically. \"A company that big needs a designer?\"\n\"Exactly. Because the company is large and has many projects, we need to expand the team,\" he replied without missing a beat. \"Instead of wasting money hiring externally, why not have you join us?\"\nVictoria frowned. \"I haven't graduated yet, no degree.\"\n\"I don't mind.\"\n\"I lack experience, can't handle it.\"\n\"You helped Marcella shine at the exchange event. Don't be modest. Our company needs talent like you. To become a top display designer, you need the platform I can provide.\"\nVictoria's mind was in turmoil. William was still the same; he knew how to control her, knew what she wanted and cared about!\nVictoria indeed aspired to be an outstanding display designer. Her years at Starry Studio Gallery had fueled her passion for display design. Compared to Dreamscape Construction, Infinity Unity Group, a Fortune 500 company, undoubtedly offered more opportunities to showcase her talents.\nBut she looked at William and after a moment said, \"I don't want to mix business with personal matters.\"\n\"Funny, neither do I.\" William lazily lowered his eyes. \"I've always said I'm a businessman, I don't do unprofitable deals. In business, having you work for my company is the best use of resources, maximizing benefits. But I don't know what you are expecting?\"\n\"Who's expecting anything?\" Victoria didn't expect that after years apart, William had learned to turn the tables on her!\nIgnoring her reaction, William continued, \"You don't need to worry. To me, you're just someone who can save me money. Plus, you don't belong to any faction, your background is clean, I can use you with peace of mind.\"\nVictoria glared at him. \"What if I don't agree?\"\n\"You will,\" William said confidently. \"You love your work too much to pass up this opportunity. After all, none of the companies you currently have access to can compare to Infinity Unity Group.\"\nVictoria looked away. Damn it, he was right.\n\"I need to think about it.\" She was still cautious.\n\"Don't keep me waiting too long, I don't have much patience.\"\nJust then, a nurse came in to notify Victoria it was time for a check-up.\nWilliam stood up and walked over to her, extending a hand.\nVictoria stared at it for a moment, then turned away, pretending not to see it. She stood up and said, \"I can manage on my own, no need to trouble you.\"\nAfter all, he was too \"expensive\" for her to afford!\nWilliam smirked. \"Who else should you trouble if not your 'honey'?\"\nVictoria's face turned red uncontrollably. \"I've already explained everything.\"\nHe didn't say anything, but grabbed her wrist. \"The doctor said you're too weak. If no one's around, who knows what might happen?\"\nShe was puzzled. \"Did the doctor really say that?\"\n\"Want me to bring him over so you can ask yourself?\"\n\"No need.\" Victoria's heart raced and her breathing became uneven as they stood close together. \nShe silently cursed herself for being so weak. Just a moment ago, she was so confident, but now, just because he got close, she was flustered.\nWilliam, on the other hand, showed no emotion on his face. His eyes remained deep and dark. But the moment he touched her, it felt like something lightly pricked his heart, a bit numb, with a faint, almost imperceptible pain.\nThis feeling was intoxicating. He didn't want to let go of her wrist, his fingers unconsciously tightening slightly, wanting to hold on tighter.\nShe let out a low cry.\nWilliam raised an eyebrow. \"Did I hurt you?\"\nHe loosened his grip and glanced at her wrist, noticing a faint scar. His brows furrowed even more.\nVictoria had no idea what he was thinking. She just felt uncomfortable. Finally, they reached the hallway outside the room, and she looked up to see a very familiar face.\nAlice seemed to have rushed over from somewhere, standing anxiously at the door. The first thing she saw was the two of them walking closely together.\nVictoria hadn't expected to see Alice here. But thinking about Alice's obsession with William, it wasn't surprising she followed him here, especially with Victoria around. Her alarm bells must be ringing.\nHonestly, Victoria never liked Alice. Remembering the things Alice had done, Victoria used to avoid her as much as possible. She couldn't afford to provoke her, so she stayed away.\nBut things were different now.\nAlice scrutinized Victoria carefully, only momentarily losing her composure before regaining her haughty demeanor, taking control of the situation.\n\"You disappeared in the middle of a meeting without a word? I was worried sick looking for you,\" she said to William, seemingly full of concern but actually filled with reproach, subtly hinting at her close relationship with him.\nSo what if the engagement was called off? For the past three years, she had been the one by his side.\nWilliam treated her naturally, not even bothering to explain Victoria's presence, simply responding, \"Something came up.\"\nShe nodded slightly, not pressing further.\nWilliam escorted Victoria to her check-up. In front of Alice, Victoria didn't refuse.\nWhen the nurse said she needed to remove her outerwear, Alice stepped forward. \"You're a man, it's not appropriate. Let me help, you wait outside.\"",

        "content": "William glanced at Victoria, but she wasn't even looking at him. He frowned, opened the door, and walked out.\nOnly then did Alice turn to Victoria, her eyes brazenly scanning her up and down. \"So, you don't need any help, right?\"\nVictoria had been ignoring her the whole time, only turning her gaze back slowly when she heard Alice speak. She gave a faint smile. \"Nope, I don't. So, Ms. Garcia, don't trouble yourself. Staying here will just make things awkward for both of us.\"\nAlice casually pulled out her business card and handed it over. \"Don't be in such a rush. Just wanted to remind you, Ms. Carter, if you need anything in the future, give me a call. William's got a lot on his plate; his time isn't just for one person.\"\nVictoria felt a bit guilty about the whole situation. The call had come from the hospital, but it was because she had made a foolish note.\nIt wasn't just William or Alice who might overthink it; even she found it absurd and laughable.\nSo, faced with Alice's half-warning, half-insulting words, Victoria didn't argue back.\nWhen Alice came out, William was on the phone not far away.\nHis phone was on silent, and calls had been coming in one after another. He was finally getting a chance to handle them.\nAfter giving a few instructions, he hung up and turned around to see Alice.\n\"Why are you out here?\" He frowned slightly.\nAlice walked straight up to him, looking him directly in the eyes. \"What are you worried about? She's perfectly fine but here trying to get your sympathy! I don't believe you can't see that!\"\nWilliam lowered his eyes, his expression indifferent. \"Then let her put on a good show.\"\n\"William! Victoria doesn't care about you! It's been three years. If she still had feelings for you, how could she not have called even once? When you truly love someone, even three months, three days, or three hours apart is torture!\"\nAlice seemed desperate to wake him up, clenching her fists, her eyes slightly red.\n\"You're played by a woman who doesn't care about you; you really disappoint me!\" She shouted, then turned and walked away.\nWilliam remained expressionless, not even calling out to stop her or offering any explanation as he watched her leave.\nAlice walked all the way to the hospital entrance.\nShe suddenly stopped, taking deep breaths, reminding herself not to act impulsively.\nWilliam didn't like others interfering with him, and he hated being controlled. The reason they had managed to get along for the past three years was largely because she knew her boundaries.\nAfter thinking it over, she took out her phone. \"Grandpa Scott, this is Alice...\"\nWhen Victoria came out of the examination room, she saw William sitting outside.\nHe seemed deep in thought, his brows furrowed, his gaze distant.\nShe was surprised, thinking he had already left.\nSeeing her come out, he stood up. \"Let's go.\"\nVictoria followed behind him, looking up at his tall, upright figure.\nShe could clearly feel the long-buried emotions in her heart quietly resurfacing.\nBut now, facing these indescribable feelings again, she was no longer as flustered as before and could handle them calmly.\nSo, she suppressed these emotions and spoke calmly. \"Thanks for today. But let's part ways here. I can take care of myself.\"\nWilliam abruptly stopped.\nVictoria also stopped, her heart starting to tremble slightly.\nHe replied, \"You're right. You've always been able to take care of yourself.\"\nHis words shook her again. She thought she would have to argue, but he agreed so readily.\nIt seemed she had been overthinking things.\nWilliam walked past her without another word.\nVictoria stood there, slowly turning to watch him leave.\nVictoria wasn't seriously ill and was discharged the next day after spending one night in the hospital.\nAs soon as she returned to the hotel, Marcella called her to her room.\nMarcella pointed at her nose and started scolding her without giving her a chance to explain!\nVictoria's strength hadn't fully returned, and with irregular meals over the past few days, she was extremely weak.\nBut Marcella, full of energy, showed no signs of tiring as she berated her.\nFinally, Victoria couldn't take it anymore and interrupted Marcella. \"Marcella, I think you misunderstand. I'm an employee of the gallery, not your personal assistant, and certainly not your servant to be ordered around.\"\nIgnoring Marcella's furious expression, she slammed the door and left.\n\"Come back here! Do you hear me? Victoria, come back!\"\nThe only response was the sound of the door slamming shut across the hall.\nMarcella was livid. How dare a lowly employee who relied on her for survival talk back?\nEspecially since Victoria had always been so submissive, her sudden rebellion was a shock Marcella couldn't handle.\n\"Don't think that just because you made a splash at the exchange, you can stand on equal footing with me! Without me, you're nothing!\" Marcella swept everything off the table in a fit of rage, her face contorted with anger.\nBut now she had a problem. She had driven Victoria away, so what about the dinner Delmar had arranged for tonight?\nDelmar had specifically asked her to bring her \"assistant.\"\nThough Marcella was extremely annoyed that Victoria had caught Delmar's eye, she still had to bring her along.\nBut on the other hand, if Victoria didn't show up because she was angry, it would be her own fault for missing the opportunity, and she couldn't blame anyone else!\nEven if Delmar asked, she had plenty of excuses!\nThinking this, Marcella smiled smugly.\nVictoria rarely lost her temper like this. She knew Marcella's personality and wouldn't waste time on pointless arguments.\nMaybe it was because she had run into someone she didn't want to see, and her mood was terrible, making she felt Marcella's usual arrogance unbearable this time.\nBack in her room, Victoria fell asleep immediately, deciding that no matter what, she needed to rest first.\nShe slept as if she were cut off from the world.\nShe was woken by the ringing of her phone.\nWhen she answered, a cheerful voice came through. \"Victoria?\"\nVictoria frowned. \"Alton?\"\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Sleeping.\" She couldn't help but yawn.\n\"That's no good! Such a beautiful day, you can't waste it sleeping! Get dressed up nicely, I'll come pick you up in a bit.\"\nVictoria sat up, puzzled. \"Why are you picking me up?\"\n\"You're staying for a while, right? I'll show you around.\"\nBefore she could refuse, Alton hung up after saying, \"See you in an hour.\"\nVictoria sat there for a moment, then touched her stomach. She did need to go out and eat something.\nAn hour later, Alton arrived on time.\n\"You're wearing that?\" He looked her up and down. She was wearing a simple white cotton dress, her hair tied in a casual ponytail, and no makeup.\nThough she looked fresh and elegant, it was a bit too plain.\nVictoria blinked, looking down at herself. \"We're not going on a date. This is fine, isn't it?\"",

        "content": "Alton couldn't help but chuckle as he opened the car door with a playful flourish. \"After you.\"\nOnce they were inside, he glanced at her and half-joked, \"You trust me this much? Aren't you worried I might sell you off?\"\nVictoria shot back, \"Would you?\"\nFeigning deep thought, he replied, \"It's not that I wouldn't, it's that I don't dare.\"\nWith William around, he wouldn't dare no matter what!\nVictoria asked, \"So, where are you taking me?\"\n\"Just a gathering of some industry bigwigs. It's pretty boring, but the food is great. Think of it as a chance to enjoy a good meal.\"\nVictoria smiled, pleased with his answer.\nBut her satisfaction didn't last long. As soon as she followed Alton into the private room, she froze.\nShe hadn't expected to see Marcella and Delmar there!\nMarcella's face darkened when she saw Victoria, while Delmar was momentarily taken aback before asking, \"You're Victoria, right? Weren't you supposed to be busy?\"\nVictoria raised an eyebrow, her gaze sweeping over Marcella's guilty expression, instantly understanding the situation.\nShe gave Delmar a faint smile. \"Plans changed.\"\n\"Glad you could make it!\" Delmar seemed genuinely pleased, especially when he noticed Alton following behind her. His eyes lit up.\n\"Victoria, you know Mr. Bridges too?\" he asked.\nMarcella, now noticing Alton, recognized him as the man she had seen at the hotel a few days ago.\nAlton led Victoria to a seat, smiling. \"Victoria is a friend of mine.\"\n\"What a coincidence!\" Delmar laughed heartily. First William, and now Alton. The more he looked at Victoria, the more he felt she brought good luck!\nMarcella eyed Victoria warily, relieved when she saw no intention of exposing her. With a smile, she chided, \"You should have called me when your plans changed. I could have sent someone to pick you up. You're new here, what if something happened?\"\nVictoria gave her a cold glance, too tired to deal with her hypocrisy.\n\"This place has some of the best security in the country. I had nothing to worry about.\" With that, she turned her attention away from Marcella.\nMarcella kept smiling, but inside, she was seething.\nDid Victoria think that just because Delmar favored her, she could rise above her station?\nNot while Marcella was around!\nHowever, Alton, sitting next to Victoria, caught her attention. She kept steering the conversation towards him, occasionally toasting him with a drink.\nAlton, having navigated such social scenes for years, was no longer the naive young man he once was.\nHe had seen enough of human nature to understand people like Marcella.\nBut he maintained a gentle demeanor and a smile.\nFor him, it was all about interests now, not personal likes or dislikes.\nSo, he kept his emotions in check, responding to Marcella's enthusiasm like a seasoned player in love, neither rejecting her nor making her feel brushed off.\nIt was as if he gave her hope, yet not quite, making her feel that just a bit more effort would suffice.\nUnder this illusion, Marcella became even more eager to please him.\nVictoria noticed all of this. When Alton poured her a drink, she whispered, \"She's still my boss. Don't go too far.\"\nAlton knew what she meant and smiled. \"I'm not doing anything. It's all in her head.\"\nVictoria rolled her eyes. \"That's what makes it worse!\"\nHe teased, \"I didn't know you had become a little justice warrior!\"\nTheir interaction, seen by Marcella, looked like they were whispering secrets.\nShe glared at Victoria, convinced she was deliberately opposing her.\nDelmar, meanwhile, chatted with others, but his attention never strayed far from them.\nAt the same time, the scene of Victoria and Alton together was noticed by someone just entering the room.\nWilliam glanced at them briefly, showing no emotion, as if they didn't interest him at all.\nBeside him was Alice, elegantly dressed in a red gown that accentuated her figure. Her captivating eyes could easily enchant anyone.\nTogether, she and William looked like a perfect couple.\nVictoria hadn't expected them to be there. She immediately glared at Alton, who quickly raised his hands in mock innocence.\n\"Mr. Scott never shares his schedule with us. I just wanted to treat you to a good meal! Pure coincidence, I swear!\"\nAlton had clearly become more cunning over the years, and Victoria didn't believe him.\nBut since they were already there, and it wasn't her place, she decided not to show her displeasure.\nRemembering their connection from the previous day, she smiled and greeted William. \"Mr. Scott.\"\nWilliam responded with a simple nod, not even looking at her.\nVictoria didn't mind. She had done her part in being polite; the rest was none of her concern.\nDelmar immediately stood up to welcome them. \"Mr. Scott, Ms. Garcia, welcome.\"\nAlice's eyes flashed with disdain when she saw Victoria.\nThey were seated at the head of the table, directly opposite Victoria and Alton.\nAlton leaned slightly towards Victoria, whispering, \"You'll have to protect me later.\"\nVictoria gave him a complex look.\nProtect him?\nWhy should she?\nEveryone here had a higher status than her.\nShe placed a delicate dish on his plate. \"Eat more, talk less.\"\n\"You seem smart usually, but why act dumb at crucial moments?\" He ate the dish she gave him.\nTheir familiar interaction didn't look like just friends.\nMarcella noticed and teased, \"Victoria, you and Mr. Bridges seem close. Did you two have a past romance? I'm so envious.\"\nShe scooted closer to Alton. \"Mr. Bridges, do tell.\"\nHer interest in Alton was obvious, and she shot a warning glance at Victoria, clearly staking her claim.\nWilliam, listening to Delmar, glanced over casually, his deep eyes growing darker.\nAlice smiled, sipping her wine, her gaze towards Victoria filled with mockery.\nTo her, Victoria was only fit for someone like Alton, a fallen rich kid.\nVictoria lowered her eyes. Before Alton could speak, she firmly said, \"Marcella, you misunderstand. Alton and I are just friends. There's no story.\"\nAlton, eager to avoid trouble, quickly nodded. \"It's true! I admire Victoria's talent, nothing more!\"\nMarcella was pleased. \"I see, my mistake for jumping to conclusions.\"\nAlton stood up respectfully, raising his glass. \"Mr. Scott, a toast to you.\"\nWilliam glanced at him lazily, taking his time before raising his glass.\nOnly then did Alton relax.\nHe didn't want any trouble!\nDelmar joked, \"When can we attend Mr. Scott and Ms. Garcia's wedding?\"\nVictoria paused mid-bite.",

        "content": "From the moment Victoria saw William and Alice together, she knew deep down that their shared backgrounds and talents would eventually bring them together.\nBut then she heard William said, \"I'm also eager to attend Alice's wedding.\"\nThat one question shattered all the rumors about them being a couple.\nDelmar, sensing the awkwardness, quickly smiled to lighten the mood. \"I get it, you two are just super focused on your careers!\"\nAlice bit her lip and looked up at William, her eyes filled with sadness.\nShe let out a soft, bitter laugh. \"You want me to get married so badly? Who'd marry me now? Everyone knows my story. Who'd want me?\"\nShe didn't say more, just picked up her drink and downed it in one go.\nWilliam stared at her, his jaw tight. When the waiter came over to pour more wine, he blocked the glass with his hand. \"Get her some water.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nAlice, unusually stubborn, shot back, \"What, I can't even drink now?\"\nWilliam frowned and slowly moved his hand away.\n\"Pour the wine,\" Alice demanded.\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\nAcross the table, Marcella was bombarding Alton with questions; Delmar was chatting animatedly with some friends. Victoria, quietly eating, tried to stay unnoticed but couldn't help watching the interaction between William and Alice.\nAlice could usually handle her liquor, but she was in a bad mood today, so she got drunk quickly.\nWilliam, seeing this, took her glass away. \"I'll take you home.\"\nAlice leaned against him. \"Why are you so good to me? But you can't marry me? Do you despise me too? Anyone can despise me, but not you. You can't! I became the 'bad woman' they talk about because of you.\"\n\"Stop talking,\" William's brows furrowed deeply.\nHer words cut him deeply.\nSeeing Alice drunk, Delmar and the others quickly escorted them to the door. \"Mr. Scott, should I send someone to take you home?\"\nAlton hurried over as well. \"Mr. Scott, let me handle it.\"\nAs a subordinate, he had to help his boss.\n\"No need.\" William still held Alice in his arms, not letting anyone else intervene.\nAlice clung to him, her arms tightly around his neck, her face buried in his chest. \"William, take me home.\"\nHe looked down at her. \"Okay.\"\nThe tenderness in his voice was surprising coming from someone as decisive as William.\nHe didn't look back as they left.\nVictoria kept her head down, eating the delicate pastries on her plate.\nDelmar and the others started gossiping. \"Did you see that? So affectionate. I don't believe there's nothing between them!\"\n\"Yeah, they were engaged before, but then they broke it off for some reason.\"\n\"It's normal. They're both career-driven. It takes time to adjust.\"\nAlton, while dealing with Marcella, glanced worriedly at Victoria.\n\"I need to use the restroom,\" Victoria suddenly said, standing up.\nAlton offered to go with her. \"I'll come with you.\"\n\"No need.\" She pushed the door open and left.\nVictoria stood in the hallway, took a deep breath, and suppressed her irritation before heading to the restroom.\nAs she approached, she heard William's concerned voice by the sink. \"Feeling any better?\"\n\"No, I still feel awful.\"\nVictoria's steps halted abruptly. She turned around, leaning against the hallway wall, staring at the floor.\n\"If you can't handle alcohol, why drink so much? You're only hurting yourself. What were you thinking?\" William's scolding was full of concern.\n\"Why did I drink? You don't know why?\" Alice's voice was full of grievance. \"People asked me such questions in public, and you just flatly denied it. Did you consider my dignity?\"\n\"It won't happen again.\" William seemed particularly accommodating to her.\nVictoria listened quietly. The two of them had a genuine past together.\nAlthough they had broken off their engagement, their lingering connection spoke volumes.\n\"I feel so awful,\" Alice said, leaning against William. \"Take me home.\"\n\"Okay.\" William put an arm around her waist and helped her up. \"I'll have the maid make you some hangover soup.\"\n\"Got it.\"\nVictoria waited until they left before slowly coming out.\nLooking at the empty hallway ahead, she lowered her gaze, a faint, bitter smile forming on her lips.\nThis was for the best.\nIt really was.\nAlton offered to take Victoria back to the hotel. Marcella immediately stood up. \"Perfect, it's on the way. Mr. Bridges, would you mind giving me a ride too?\"\n\"Not at all,\" Alton replied.\nVictoria admired Alton's patience and composure with women.\nBefore parting, Delmar pulled Victoria aside for a private word.\n\"Victoria, you have a bright future ahead.\"\n\"Delmar, you're too kind.\"\n\"Have you considered developing your career here? With your talent, it won't be long before you make a name for yourself.\"\nVictoria was taken aback. Delmar didn't press for an answer, just smiled and told her to think it over.\nIn the parking lot, Marcella quickly took the front seat. Victoria glanced at her but said nothing, sitting in the back.\nShe was past the age of caring about such trivial matters.\nThroughout the ride, Marcella chatted with Alton, their laughter filling the car.\nVictoria leaned back, gazing out the window, lost in thought.\nAlton glanced in the rearview mirror and smiled. \"I'm off tomorrow. Want to go somewhere?\"\nIt was clear he was asking Victoria.\n\"Sure!\" Marcella quickly responded, excited. \"I've been wanting to visit some famous spots in the city!\"\nAlton smiled but said nothing more.\nSoon, the car stopped at the hotel entrance.\nMarcella received a call just as Victoria was about to get out. Alton called after her.\n\"If Mr. Scott and she were meant to be, it would have happened by now. It wouldn't have dragged on this long.\"\nVictoria smiled. \"Thanks for tonight, Alton.\"\nBack at the hotel, Marcella blocked her path.\nThough her expression was still unpleasant, her attitude had softened. \"Are you going tomorrow?\"\n\"No.\"\nMarcella frowned. She could tell Victoria wasn't interested in Alton, so she no longer saw her as a rival.\nShe got straight to the point. \"I like him.\"\nVictoria looked up. \"Congratulations.\"\n\"Don't be sarcastic. Will you help me or not?\"\n\"Marcella, you like him, not me. How can I help?\"\n\"Victoria, don't play dumb,\" Marcella said bluntly. \"Help me create opportunities, and I'll get you promoted.\"\nVictoria's face darkened. \"I don't need to trade favors for a promotion.\"\nMarcella frowned. She disliked Victoria not just because she was Hannah's rival, but also because of her annoying pride!\nMarcella glared at her. Victoria was truly unyielding. Finally, Marcella said, \"Fine, you're amazing. But as the general manager, I'm asking you to help. Is that enough?\"\nIt wasn't easy for Marcella to ask for help.\nAnd Victoria had never seen her so invested in anyone.\nAfter thinking it over, she said, \"I'll go tomorrow, just to relax.\"\nMarcella smiled. \"Got it.\"\nFor the first time, she found Victoria not so annoying.",

        "content": "Alton showed up early, and Marcella was dressed to impress.\nShe wore a light pink floral dress, paired with a delicate lace hat and a matching small handbag, giving off a sweet and charming vibe.\nIn contrast, Victoria was much more casual, even a bit disheveled.\nFrom the moment Marcella saw her, she looked at her with disdain. Taking advantage of Alton going to buy drinks, she couldn't help but ask, \"I heard from Hannah that your family isn't well-off, but not this bad, right?\"\nVictoria was speechless.\nHow rude could she be?\nShe didn't respond, and Marcella took her silence as agreement.\n\"No matter how broke you are, you should have a few decent clothes! It's one thing to dress like an average person at work, but when you're out to meet a guy, you should at least make an effort.\"\n\"I'm fine like this.\"\nMarcella rolled her eyes, \"You're hopeless!\"\nWhen Alton returned, Marcella immediately became sweet and well-behaved.\nThey finally arrived at their destination.\nThe city's largest outdoor recreational campsite.\nAlton chose a relatively secluded spot, with plenty of space between the tents to ensure privacy.\nTwo tents, one for the guys and one for the girls.\nThen, Alton got busy preparing a feast.\nMarcella went to help, and when she saw Victoria approaching, she kept giving her looks, \"Didn't you stay up late last night? Go rest in the tent for a bit.\"\nVictoria raised an eyebrow, perfectly happy with the suggestion.\nSo, she happily crawled into a tent and fell asleep.\nShe didn't know how long she slept, but Marcella came in once to wake her, \"Time to eat.\"\nVictoria, who hadn't slept well the night before, was in a deep sleep and waved her off, \"Not hungry.\"\n\"Really?\"\nMarcella's voice had a hint of glee.\nWhen Victoria woke up again, it was to the sound of laughter outside.\nShe realized it was already dark outside, with bonfires blazing and people having a great time all around.\nVictoria crawled out of the tent and stretched lazily.\nBefore she could fully wake up, a large coat was draped over her shoulders.\nShe froze, maintaining her stretching pose, staring blankly at the person in front of her.\nWilliam?\nWhat was he doing here?\nWilliam, holding a skewer of grilled meat, glanced at her, \"Do you even know where you are? Wearing so little to sleep.\"\nVictoria belatedly looked down and realized her loose short-sleeve shirt had slipped off one shoulder, revealing a bit of smooth skin.\nIt was somewhat alluring.\nShe instinctively pulled the coat tighter around her.\n\"Eat something.\" William placed the grilled food on a plate and handed it to her.\nVictoria hesitated for only a second before taking it and sitting down to eat quietly.\nWilliam stood beside her, his tall and handsome figure drawing attention, along with his strikingly good looks. Many girls came over to chat him up.\nWith the night, the alcohol, and the lively atmosphere, everyone was letting loose, mingling freely with strangers and friends alike.\nBut someone as outstanding as William drew even more attention, and soon someone asked for his contact information.\nWilliam, who was usually impatient, initially responded perfunctorily, but eventually, he simply stepped aside to reveal Victoria, \"Sorry, my girlfriend is here.\"\nVictoria stiffened slightly, the term \"girlfriend\" making her ears burn.\nBut she understood he was just using her as a shield, so she didn't overthink it.\nThe girl got the hint and left with a smile.\nBut it wasn't long before another girl, wearing a crop top and shorts, sauntered over, leaning in close and calling out sweetly, \"Hey there...\"\nThis time, William was more direct, pointing at Victoria, \"My wife.\"\nThe girl awkwardly touched her nose and walked away.\nHearing him call her \"wife\" so smoothly, Victoria frowned and sincerely suggested, \"You know, wearing a mask might help.\"\nWilliam glanced at her, taking in her reluctance.\nHe narrowed his eyes and smirked, \"With you here, why should I inconvenience myself?\"\nVictoria looked up at him, \"You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?\"\n\"Doing what on purpose?\"\n\"Making me uncomfortable.\"\nWilliam chuckled, \"Saying you're my wife makes you uncomfortable?\"\n\"No! I mean... never mind.\" She decided it wasn't worth explaining further.\nKeeping things simple between them was best.\nAmid the surrounding noise and excitement, it felt like an invisible barrier separated the two of them.\nAfter finishing her food, she asked, \"Why are you here?\"\nHe looked at her with mild confusion, \"Didn't you see the sign when you entered this area?\"\nVictoria shook her head, bewildered.\n\"How do you expect to be a designer with no observational skills?\" he retorted.\nVictoria didn't appreciate that comment. She focused intensely at work, but during her time off, she didn't want to force herself.\n\"This land belongs to the Scott family, and so does this campsite. I come here once a month, and it just so happens to be today, coincidentally running into you.\" William emphasized the point.\nVictoria mentally rolled her eyes. As if he was afraid she'd think he came just for her.\nBut with that explanation, she felt more at ease.\n\"Is there more food?\" She had slept all day, and the few bites she had weren't enough.\nWilliam's deep, attractive eyes lingered on her, a slight smile playing on his lips, \"Wait here.\"\nVictoria obediently sat in her chair, smiling as she watched the people enjoying themselves.\n\"So, have you thought about what I mentioned?\" He returned, handing her more food.\n\"About working at your company?\" Victoria asked.\n\"Technically, it's not my company, it's my aunt's.\"\nDaisy?\nWilliam continued, \"Aunt Daisy handles all the major and minor affairs of the company. I'm just trying to find some trustworthy people to help her out.\" He paused, then added, \"You know about the issues between me and Uncle Wayne...\"\nVictoria understood immediately and said, \"How's she doing now? I would like to help if she truly needs me. \"\nNow it was William's turn to be surprised. He scrutinized her, \"Last time I mentioned it, you seemed reluctant. But as soon as I mentioned Aunt Daisy, you show so much concern. She must hold a special place in your heart.\"\nThere was a hint of jealousy in his tone.\nBut Victoria didn't think much of it. She was only concerned about Daisy's situation, and William patiently explained a bit more.\nThe firelight cast a warm glow on her face, making her look both charming and cozy. William watched her for a moment before looking away.\nHe said, \"You and Alton seem to get along well. Actually, you two hit it off years ago. And if I remember correctly, you even got hurt because of him.\"\nVictoria rolled her eyes at him, \"That was ages ago. We're just friends.\"\n\"And now?\" He didn't seem ready to drop the subject, staring at her intently, \"What if he confessed his feelings to you now?\"\nVictoria frowned, about to speak, but then her expression softened. \"Now? He wouldn't be that foolish.\"\nSeeing her gaze fixed in a certain direction, smiling, William followed her line of sight.\nHe was stunned.\nAlton and Marcella were hidden behind a nearby tree, locked in a passionate embrace, kissing deeply.",

And I don't need exercise.\"\nHer protest was completely ignored.\nWilliam's grip was strong, and as he pulled her along, Victoria almost stumbled.\nShe quickly shook off his hand. \"I can walk by myself.\"\nWilliam shoved his hands into his pockets, looking at the lively scene around them. \"What do you think of this place? Any suggestions?\"\n\"No complaints, it's great.\"\nSeeing her perfunctory attitude, William just raised an eyebrow slightly and said nothing more.\nThe two of them walked around the camp, and as the crowd gradually dispersed, only two bonfires continued to burn brightly.\nVictoria didn't want to be alone with him and was about to head back when she received a message from Marcella.\n[Don't come back so soon!!!]\nStaring at those three exclamation marks, Victoria understood perfectly well what was going on.\nAre those two moving too fast?\nAs she sat by the fire in a daze, William spoke leisurely beside her. \"Now you know why I asked you to come out for a walk?\"\nVictoria looked at him in surprise. \"You figured it out already?\"\nHe scoffed. \"A guy and a girl alone together, what else could it be?\"\nVictoria's heart skipped a beat, and she blurted out, \"Is that how it was back then with you too?\"\nShe regretted it as soon as she said it.\nDamn, what's wrong with her tonight?\n\"I was just asking casually, no other meaning. Just pretend I didn't ask,\" she quickly added.\nBut William looked at her deeply, the flickering firelight in his eyes seemed to be saying something.\n\"To you, I...\"\nHer heart tightened. She didn't want to know the answer, but she couldn't help feeling nervous.\nJust then, a series of loud bangs erupted, and the sky lit up with a dazzling display of fireworks.\nIt was the camp's regular fireworks show.\nVictoria watched William's mouth move, but the answer she deliberately ignored was lost in the brilliant fireworks.\nWhen the fireworks ended, Victoria slowly looked away.\nWilliam was on the phone.\nShe overheard him asking, \"How are you feeling now? I'm at the camp. Yes, I'll be back soon.\"\nVictoria suddenly lost interest. Whatever he was about to say no longer mattered.\nShe didn't want to delve into it. Keeping things as they were was just fine.\nWilliam turned and saw her, hesitated for a moment, but Victoria spoke first. \"Leaving? Go ahead.\"\nShe got up and walked back, hoping she wouldn't run into an awkward scene when she returned. Their alone time had lasted long enough.\nSuddenly, William grabbed her wrist.\nShe looked up, her expression calm as water.\nWilliam frowned, staring at her intently. \"Can you stay?\"\n\"Of course not.\" She smiled lightly, gently pushing his hand away. \"One night here is enough. Beautiful experiences should be left with a sense of longing, so you'll look forward to coming back next time.\"\nWilliam wanted to say something, but his phone rang again.\nThe frown on his face deepened.\nHe finally answered, \"Okay, I'm leaving now.\"\nVictoria gave him a brief glance and turned to leave.\nBy the time William hung up and turned back, she was already far away.\nWhen Victoria got back to the tent, she deliberately cleared her throat.\nSoon, Marcella, cheeks flushed, emerged from Alton's tent. \"You're back. Get some rest.\"\nShe ducked into another tent.\nA moment later, Alton came out too.\nVictoria looked at him with a hint of disdain.\n\"Why are you looking at me like that?\" Alton felt wronged. \"Weren't you the one who set us up?\"\n\"Are you serious about this?\"\n\"What does serious mean? Marriage?\" Alton laughed and waved his hand. \"Even if I proposed now, she wouldn't say yes. So why think so far ahead? Just enjoy the moment.\"\nVictoria's views were a bit traditional. To her, any relationship not aimed at marriage was irresponsible.\nAlton changed the subject. \"What about you and Mr. Scott?\"\nVictoria immediately crossed her arms, signaling him to stop.\n\"Don't ask. It won't change anything.\"\n\"Alright.\" Alton lit a cigarette, looking content and relaxed, making Victoria roll her eyes. \n\"Marcella is my boss. Don't mess around. If you really don't want to continue, at least talk to her properly. Don't just disappear! Otherwise, even if she doesn't come looking for you, I will!\"\nAlton was amused by her words. \"Alright, alright. For your sake, I won't be an irresponsible jerk.\"\nVictoria said no more and turned back to her tent.\nMarcella seemed to be asleep already. Victoria quietly took off her jacket and slipped into her sleeping bag.\nSuddenly, a voice came from beside her. \"Thanks for earlier.\"\nVictoria was startled.\nShe heard that?\nAfter speaking, Marcella seemed a bit embarrassed, adjusting her position and pretending to fall asleep quickly. \nAfter returning from the camp, Marcella and Alton were completely smitten with each other.\nThe two were inseparable, making Victoria feel like a third wheel.\nShe had come to Harborview City on paid leave, with flexible vacation rules.\nOriginally, she planned to relax, but seeing the situation, she decided it was better to head back soon.\n\"No way!\"\nThe first to object was Marcella.\nShe had just gotten together with Alton and didn't want to return to Silvermist City so soon.\n\"I mean, you stay here, and I'll go back alone.\" Victoria patiently explained.\n\"That's even worse!\" Marcella sat down next to her, linking her arm with Victoria's, acting like a close friend, which made Victoria a bit uncomfortable.",

        "content": "Victoria gently pulled her arm away. \"I liked it better the way it was before. The way you are now, it kind of freaks me out.\"\n\"Oh, come on,\" Marcella teased, her eyes sparkling with amusement. \"I used to think you were such a pain, but now that I know you better, you're not so bad.\"\n\"Gee, thanks.\" Victoria didn't think that was much of a compliment.\nIt was probably because she'd been helping Marcella in her pursuit of Alton.\nMarcella's playful expression faded as she spoke more seriously. \"Actually, I've been thinking about something...\"\nVictoria was surprised by what she heard next. \"You want to stay here?\"\nMarcella shrugged. \"I was never really into the gallery. Staring at paintings and sculptures all day gives me a headache. I told my dad to transfer me to the branch here.\"\nVictoria knew Alton was popular with the ladies, but she hadn't realized he had this much charm.\nEven though Marcella was just an illegitimate child with little inheritance rights, Alton had managed to captivate her so quickly. He must have some serious skills.\nIt seemed like he had gone through a lot during the years his family had fallen on hard times.\n\"Well, if you want to stay, that's your decision.\"\n\"Of course not!\" Marcella linked her arm with Victoria's again. \"We're a dream team! I can't do this without you! You're so upright, I can't just leave you behind!\"\nVictoria didn't believe a word of her grandiose speech.\n\"What's with that look?\" Marcella avoided Victoria's gaze, feeling a bit guilty. \"Okay, okay, I admit it. You did help me out a little.\"\nVictoria raised an eyebrow. Just a little?\n\"Fine, fine! I owe my success to you, happy now?\" Marcella said.\nVictoria looked away. To be honest, it was true.\nGetting Marcella's approval wasn't easy.\n\"So, Victoria, will you stay here with me?\" Marcella batted her eyes in a rare display of cuteness, which only gave Victoria goosebumps. \"I heard Mr. Scott wants you to work at Infinity Unity Group. I'll get the gallery to let you go and give you a hefty severance package. How about that?\"\n\"Can you just talk normally, Marcella?\"\n\"I don't care. You have to agree! Otherwise, I'll keep talking like this!\"\nVictoria frowned, feeling like she didn't know her anymore. But the offer of several times her severance pay from Starry Studio Gallery was tempting.\n\"Honestly, I preferred the old you. This sudden friendliness is a bit unsettling.\"\n\"Oh, come on! I've always been this sweet and simple! I just listened to Hannah before and thought you were scheming. Naturally, I was cautious around you. But now, I genuinely consider you a friend!\"\nVictoria didn't know how to respond to her sudden sincerity.\nMarcella then spent the entire afternoon listing the benefits of staying in Harborview City, pestering her until Victoria finally agreed to discuss it with her family.\nAs soon as she left Victoria's room, Marcella called Alton.\n\"I did what you said and appealed to her emotions. She said she'd think about it!\"\nAlton chuckled softly on the other end. \"I knew you could do it, babe!\"\n\"Of course.\" She smiled as she returned to her room, clutching her phone.\nJust then, the door of Victoria's room slowly opened.\nVictoria lowered her eyes, a slight smile playing on her lips.\nNo wonder Marcella was so eager to convince her to stay in Harborview City.\nVictoria closed the door and immediately booked a flight.\nShe'd been in Harborview City long enough.\nAs for William's offer to join Infinity Unity Group, it was tempting, but she preferred to move at her own pace.\nBesides, she still had an instinctive desire to keep her distance from William.\nHer flight was in the evening, and as she packed, she received a call from Daisy.\n\"Victoria?\"\nDaisy wanted to meet, and since there was still time, they arranged to meet at a café near the hotel.\nVictoria spotted Daisy as soon as she walked in. Daisy looked fantastic, exuding both youthful energy and mature charm, the kind that could captivate people of all ages.\n\"You came to Harborview City and didn't even visit me. That's not very nice!\" As soon as they sat down, Daisy took the initiative.\n\"My bad, really, Daisy. I know I was wrong!\"\nVictoria was always sincere when admitting her mistakes to Daisy.\nDaisy couldn't help but laugh, not really holding it against her.\n\"Let's cut to the chase,\" Daisy said directly. \"I'm here to ask for your help. William should have mentioned that I'm in a bit of trouble.\"\nVictoria was taken aback. She had thought William was just making excuses.\nIt turned out Daisy's situation was much more serious.\n\"That's the situation. My dad's been a bit muddled lately, making poor decisions, and it's put me in a tough spot at the company. I'm not looking to fight for anything, but if Wayne's involved, there's no room for compromise!\"\n\"But what can I do? I don't know anything about this,\" Victoria asked.\nDaisy raised a hand to stop her, frowning. \"When did you become so hesitant? Where's the girl who braved Xandria with William?\"\nVictoria sighed. \"Is it possible you guys have too much faith in me?\"\n\"Don't flatter yourself. Did I say I valued your skills?\" Daisy said.\nVictoria fell silent. That was harsh.\n\"We need to build our own team within the company, but there aren't many trustworthy people around.\"\nVictoria blinked. Was that the reason?\nDaisy leaned forward, her gaze intense. \"I'll ask you straight. I'm in trouble. Will you help me or not?\"\nCould Victoria say no?\nShe realized she had no resistance against Daisy.\nThe father-daughter duo was really going to lose to Daisy!\nAs they left the café, Daisy patted her shoulder approvingly. \"Do well. I have high hopes for you.\"\nVictoria smiled wryly. \"Thanks for the vote of confidence, Daisy.\"\nAfter dropping Victoria off at the hotel, Daisy waved. \"I'll pick you up tomorrow.\"\nBefore Victoria could respond, Daisy had already driven off.\nAs soon as she hit the road, Daisy's phone rang.\nShe glanced at the caller ID, pursed her lips, and looked away, planning to ignore it.\nThe call ended after a while.\nSoon after, it rang again.\nDaisy's expression turned amused, but she still didn't answer.\nThe call ended again.\nFinally, it was quiet.\nBut just as she pulled into the garage, her phone rang again.\nThis time, she answered it leisurely. \"I'm starting to think you put a tracker on me.\"\nThe man's voice on the other end sounded slightly annoyed. \"Why didn't you answer sooner?\"\n\"I did it on purpose,\" she replied.\nShe could hear the deep breath on the other end before he slowly asked, \"Did she agree?\"\n\"I knew you'd be anxious about her. Don't worry. With me on the case, what can't be done? She'll start next week.\"",

        "content": "Hearing this, William felt a pang of discomfort. \"I've talked with her about it so many times, but she never gives me a straight answer.\"\n\"Guess that means I'm more important to Victoria than you are!\" Daisy teased.\nWilliam forced a smile, unable to argue.\n\"I'm taking her to see some apartments tomorrow. She can't keep staying at a hotel, right?\" Daisy said.\nAfter a moment of silence, William said slowly, \"I remember you have an important appointment tomorrow.\"\nDaisy laughed, \"Oh, right! But what should I do? I've already promised Victoria. I can't just break my promise, can I? This is Harborview City, and Victoria doesn't know anyone here. If something happens, how would I explain it to her family?\"\n\"Yeah, it's a tough situation,\" William remarked.\n\"I remember you seem to be free tomorrow.\"\n\"Not necessarily, I need to check with my assistant.\"\nDaisy rolled her eyes, \"Oh, come on! If you want to keep Victoria here, show some sincerity! I'll help you this time, but next time, you're on your own!\"\nWhen Victoria returned to the hotel, she saw Marcella standing in the lobby with her hands on her hips, completely disregarding her image. She marched up and demanded, \"Are you leaving? Did you book a flight?\"\nVictoria looked at her in surprise. \"How did you know?\"\n\"Never mind how I know. Are you planning to abandon me?\"\nHer outburst drew curious glances from the people around them.\nEspecially with her indignant expression, it was hard not to speculate about their relationship.\nVictoria helplessly pulled her into the elevator. \"It's a misunderstanding. I'm not planning to leave. In fact, I've decided to stay.\"\n\"Really? You're not lying to me?\"\nMarcella immediately switched to a smile and affectionately linked arms with her. \"That's more like it! Good friends should stick together!\"\nVictoria looked at her with amusement. \"So, can you report back to Alton now?\"\nMarcella paused for a moment but then said nonchalantly, \"I'm not just doing this for him. Staying here is good for our careers. Why not take the opportunity?\"\n\"Then, can you tell me what opportunity Alton gave you? Or should I ask, what special arrangements did he make for you?\"\nMarcella pretended not to understand. \"I'm so hungry! How about I treat you to dinner? Let's go for Mexican food!\"\nVictoria didn't bother arguing further and let Marcella drag her out of the hotel.\n\"Victoria, if you make a name for yourself here, you have to thank me! Without me, you wouldn't have this opportunity.\"\n\"Yes, yes, Marcella, you're my lucky charm!\"\n\"I love your quick wit. Out of everyone in the gallery, I have the highest hopes for you.\"\n\"Alright, that's enough,\" Victoria said helplessly.\n\"Got it!\"\n\"I have something urgent to attend to. I've sent someone to pick you up.\"\n\"Okay, Ms. Scott.\" Victoria answered the call as she walked out of the elevator.\nWhen she reached the entrance, a black BMW honked. She turned around, thinking it must be the person Daisy mentioned.\nShe walked over, opened the door, and got in. \"Hi, I'm...\"\nSeeing William in the driver's seat, she froze, then quickly realized what was going on.\n\"Did Ms. Scott send you?\"\nWilliam glanced at her in the rearview mirror and replied slowly, \"Yeah.\"\nVictoria felt a bit helpless.\nDaisy's matchmaking intentions were way too obvious!\nShe didn't mind, but what would William think?\nRejecting his invitation on one hand and letting Daisy play matchmaker on the other?\nVictoria quickly explained, \"I didn't know she would send you.\"\nWilliam drove steadily, lying without a hint of guilt, \"She told me last minute. Said she wouldn't trust anyone else to pick you up.\"\nVictoria believed him. That did sound like Daisy.\nThe atmosphere in the car was awkward.\nVictoria broke the silence first. \"If you have something to do, just give me the address. I can go by myself.\"\nWilliam's eyes met hers in the rearview mirror, his deep gaze seemingly calm. \"Since she asked me to come, do you think she'd let me have anything else to do?\"\nWith that, what else could she say?\nSoon, the car stopped.\nVictoria looked up at the upscale apartment complex. She knew Harborview City had expensive real estate, and the rent here wouldn't be cheap.\n\"Let's go.\" William got out of the car and looked back, seeing her still sitting there with a frown. He raised an eyebrow.\nVictoria thought for a moment and said, \"I can't afford the rent here.\"\n\"You're Aunt Daisy's favored subordinate. She'll cover everything.\"\n\"That's not right! I can't take advantage of Ms. Scott like that!\"\nWilliam suddenly leaned down, one hand on the car door, looking at her with lowered eyes. \"I notice you're kind to everyone else.\"\nVictoria didn't like that. \"Are you saying I'm not kind to you?\"\nHe responded with a light snort.\nHe tapped the car roof lazily. \"Not just you. The company always treats external hires well. During the contract period, they'll cover half the rent, plus transportation and communication allowances.\"\nHearing this, Victoria finally got out of the car.\nThey walked into the complex, one after the other. The environment was excellent, not overly luxurious but very quiet.\nSeeing the apartment, Victoria was extremely satisfied. It was exactly her ideal solo living space!\nThe apartment was on the ground floor, with a minimalist design and mostly wooden furniture. There was a small garden in front, with clusters of blooming irises.\nIn the corner was a white swing, next to a delicate wooden gazebo with an unfinished chess game on the table.\nWilliam leaned against the door, watching her explore like a curious little fairy in a dream garden.\nHe couldn't help but smile. How long had it been since he'd seen such a relaxed and joyful expression on her face?\n\"This place is beautiful!\" She stood among the blue and purple irises, smiling at him with eyes full of joy.\nHe spoke slowly, \"Do you like it?\"\n\"I love it!\"\nShe really did!\nDaisy knew her tastes so well!\nEven if she had to pay the full rent, it would be worth it!\nWilliam said immediately, \"I'll help you get your luggage from the hotel.\"\n\"No need to trouble yourself. I can manage.\"\nHer eagerness to push him away made William's face darken. \"I've already said, if you don't want to, I won't force you. Do you really need to be so defensive?\"",
