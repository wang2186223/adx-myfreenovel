###Chapter 1

LYRIC



"You used me!" I sobbed, crying to my mate who just rejected me. "Mating with me was your ladder to power, Roderick! Your Pack climbed the ranks because of me! Now that you've achieved your ambition, you don't need the ugly girl anymore, is that it? But you were willing to mate with me a year ago!"



"Oh, spare me!" Roderick rolled his eyes. "Don't act like you didn't know l'd have left you at some point.Hold on, did you really think I'd have made you the Luna of my Pack? I can barely stand the sight of you,Lyric. How do you expect me to take you to Alpha meetings and present you to others? You are disgusting!"


"But I did not give this scar to myself!" | cried bitterly.

"And you promised you'd take me to the best doctors. You didn't do any of that, Roderick! It'd have helped!"


"What? Even your own family doesn't care enough to take you to doctors, and you think I would? Quit,dreaming,Lyric and get out of my Pack!"


Tears blurred my vision. It wasn't the first time I was being called ugly, but it hurt more each time it came from Roderick.



I knew Roderick had no love for me when my family paired me with him a year ago. For a year, we lived like strangers despite being mated. I was still a virgin as he could not even bring himself to touch me.


It wasn't my fault I was ugly. Iwas burnt with a silver-base branding iron when I was a kid, leaving a huge scar by the side of my face. I still didn't know who was responsible for it, but l've had to grow up with this sting of rejection. Even my own family hated me and were embarrassed by my appearance.


But I thought Roderick would be different.I thought he'd love me. Apparently, in a world where ranks mattered the most to Pack Leaders, deceit was bound to happen.


I glared at him. I'd truly loved this man and wished he'd love me back. But now, I wish he'd suffer for what he did to me.


"You are a monster," I gritted the words. "And I hope you pay for this someday."


He threw back his head and laughed, a hollow sound."Cursed Lyric, how exactly is that going to happen?|am currently the third most powerful Alpha now. My Pack is up the ranks while your family is beneath me!There is nothing you can do to me anymore. You have always been and will always be worthless!


"Listen, I have rejected you already, and you have accepted. Although, there is one final formality left,but as far as I'm concerned, you're not longer anything to me. So, get your disgusting face out of my pack! This instant, before I have the guards throw you out!" His glare was icy, and before I could respond, he walked out. After I managed to pull myself together, I left Roderick's Pack and decided to head home-to my father's Pack. I hadn't been home since I moved into Roderick's Pack, and I hoped they'd be willing to take me in.


My family had never really liked me. Everything started falling apart after my mother left-abandoning me when I was four. Mly father chose a new mate and suddenly didn't have enough time for me. Then, I got my scar and he became even more distant.


The guards let me through the gate, but when I rang the bell of the lounge, my stepsister and her mother opened up. To my surprise, they wouldn't let me in.


"Go back to Roderick and beg him some more, Lyric.There is no room for you here," Nora said after l explained everything to them.


Despite my attempt to get them to pity me, letting them understand I had nowhere else to go, they ordered the guards to see me out. They've always taken me to be a disgrace to the family and were happy when I left for Roderick's Pack. Now, they didn't want me back.






By evening, I was seated in a bar, my favorite bar-Faceless Drunk. Over here, they mixed portions strong enough to get a wolf drunk, and you didn't have to worry about being recognized and judged as every customer made use of masks.


It had been my favorite bar for years. If people had to see my face, they'd think I was getting drunk because I was ugly.


"You're too ugly." I'd heard those words too many times, I could recite them in my sleep without missing a beat.


But above all, it was Roderick's betrayal that cut deep. It was even more painful that I could not do anything for him. His Pack was very powerful now,and I was an ugly, rejected girl who didn't even have a family to return to. Nobody could ever want me.
What was the point of living?


I emptied the last of my drink and was trying to stand when someone spoke from nowhere: "A refill for the lady,please."


I turned in surprise to find a man taking the seat beside me. The bartender nodded and proceeded to get a refill.


I furrowed my brows in surprise as I looked at the newcomer. I couldn't see his face as he was wearing a mask just like me, but something about the way he appeared told me he was sophisticated.


His suit was a Mason Étoile brand, and his watch was an Aristo Tempus watch. An average Wolf couldn't afford these things.



"You've been coming here to drink alone for some time now," he said, surprising me.


His voice... It was soothing and impossible to ignore.


I lowered my eyes, feeling alittle ashamed.How can he even tell? "I don't know what you're talking about."



"Your mask." He tipped his chin toward me. "You've never changed it."


Oh. "That means you also come here a lot."


" do. It's not quite up to my standard, but it's my favorite place. I like it when I don't get judged by anyone."


The barman returned with my drink. I thanked the newcomer before drinking from my glass.


"From the look of things, you must be troubled. I am,too. So, why don't we make a deal, Miss? Have fun for the night and go our separate ways by morning?"


I looked at him in shock. He was offering a one-night affiar!



"But y-you don't even know me," I muttered shyly.


"I do not need to. It is simply for fun."


There was something about the way he spoke. I could tell he was a man who didn't care about the feelings of others and was only out to get what he wanted.



"Although, I must warn you," he asked. "It will be a long night. I have... problems finishing on a woman.I never finish. So, like I said, it is simply for the fun of it."



Huh? He could not climax during intimacy? But I heard that was the best part of it. How could he enjoy intimacy if he had never finished on a woman before? The thought of it was sad.



Despite how absurd it sounded, a part of me was tempted. I'd always been curious about intimacy. No one has ever liked me because of my scar, not even my mate-ex-mate.


After much conviction from the newcomer, I gave it a thought.


"Can we keep our masks on?" You'll hate me just like the others if you see how ugly I am.

 
"Sure." He shrugged. "Your wish is my command, Princess."



Princess? My stomach churned.


Oh, no. He didn't know I looked like a monster. If he knew, he'd run off like the others.


I was tempted to cry. Sometimes, I really did wish l were treated like a 'Princess.'
###Chapter 2
LYRIC


We left the bar together, heading to his hotel as he called it. We drove off in his Arcanis GT. It was one of the most expensive cars in the world.



Whoever this man was, he was filthy rich. Could he possibly be an Alpha?


A part of me had been tempted to ask questions, but none of it mattered. We were simply going to make love and never see each other again.







It was the best night of my life. He made love to me in the sweetest way. Although, it was my first time,l wasn't sure intimacy could be any sweeter. I didn't want us to stop.


The stranger had been shocked to know I was a virgin. The entire session, he kept asking if I was fine and needed him to be more gentle. For the first time,someone cared about my feelings.


But something unusual happened during the intercourse.


Everything had been going so fine until he suddenly jerked while inside meand came with a deep groan.


I was shocked, but we were both in the moment and could not ask questions.



He got off me almost immediately, sitting on the edge of the bed.


"That is strange," he muttered to himself.


I was equally confused. I thought he couldn't finish on a woman?



He looked at me, and from how long it was, I could tell he was staring at me like l was a puzzle.


I was still lying on my back, exhausted. Soon, he joined me, lying beside me. He held his head up with his elbow.


"Who are you?" He ran a finger along my jaw. The touch was electric.


I swallowed hard. I am just an ugly girl who has been abandoned by everyone she's ever come across.


To my surprise, he took off his mask.


My mouth fell open in shock at the face before me.Good Moon! If he wasn't the most stunning man l'd ever met!



He was too good-looking. I could never have someone like him. He was too good for me.


I pulled the duvet further to conceal my body.


"You should've told me you were a virgin at the bar,"he said.



What did it matter? I didn't care about being a virgin anymore.


Slowly, his hand reached for my face. Realizing what he had in mind, I gasped and recoiled. "No." I shook my head, gripping the duvet tight.


"Why? You've seen my face."


Still, I shook my head.


"Our deal still stands. There's nothing to be afraid of." Hle added.


You don't understand! You'll hate me if you see my face.


The night was going too smoothly. I didn't want anything to ruin it.


"I'm ugly." I mumbled, dipping my head.


He seemed surprised.


He reached for my face again and this time, I didn't try to stop him. This was my fate.


He pulled off the mask, put a finger under my chin and tipped my head up to meet his gaze.


Tears glistened in my eyes as I stared into his silver charming eyes. He was staring right at my face, at my scar. He was going to run away now.



I shivered and closed my eyes when he ran a finger along the scar. What was he doing?


"What happened?" His tone was soft, his fingers still caressing my face.



I met his gaze and so far, there was no resentment in his eyes.



"S-Someone attacked me." I swallowed. "| was abducted and blindfolded while they hurt me. I've visited a lot of doctors, but none have been able to help"


Seconds passed. He didn't take his eyes off me.


"You're beautiful," he murmured. I frowned. What was he talking about? "You really think the scar makes you ugly?"


I shook my head, pulling my face away from his grasp. "I am ugly. Everyone tells me." More to my surprise, he pulled me in beside him,wrapping his arms around my shoulder. "Until tonight, I don't think I've ever met a lady as stunning as you, Princess."


My heart quickened as I listened to his heartbeat with my head on his chest. Uncontrollably, a tear escaped my eye. He was lying. He only wanted me to feel better.



"Do you think we could adjust our deal? I'd love to spend another day with you," he said, shocking me to the core.



What!? This was not possible. "Please."



My heart melted instantly. For the first time in my life,I was being begged to stay. Not leave.



I buried my face in his chest as I responded: "I'd love to." But like everyone eIse,he lied to me.


Like everyone else, I was deceived.


By morning,he was gone.


I woke up and couldn't find him in bed. There was no note, no trace that he had even been with me aside from the ache in-between my legs.


And to make it worse, someone showed up at the door, asking me to leave.


"The man I came with last night, do you think he'd come back?" I asked the man, my heart racing in my chest.



"No. It was his idea to get you to leave. He said he doesn't want to see you anywhere near this property.Please,leave this instant," the man said and left.


And just like that, my heart was shattered all over.But surprisingly, it hurt more than when I had been rejected by Roderick.
###Chapter 3 
LYRIC


"I'm sorry, ma'am; but I'm here to pick someone.I can't give you a free ride, if that's what you're asking." I struggled to hold back my laughter as l listened to Rufus, one of my father's oldest guards say, his eyes darting past my shoulder, looking out for the person he had been assigned to pick from the airport.



"I know. You have been sent to pick Lyric Harper,right? It's me, Rufus."


His eyes narrowed with suspicion. "You still haven't told me how you know my name. And...And how can you be Lyric? It's not possible." He shook his head."Lyric is-"


"Ugly?" | finished for him, a broad smile on my face.


He frowned as he shook his head. Back then, Rufus was the only one that had never been able to call me ugly. He was among the very few that had cared about my feelings, and even now, to a stranger,he still couldn't call me ugly.


I laughed. "Well, would it help if I reminded you that your favorite soup was butternut squash and you and little Lyric used to play Chutes and Ladders?"



Recognition beamed in his eyes. His jaw dropped in astonishment.



"Seraphis have mercy! Lyric, it's really you!" He opened his arms, and I didn't hesitate to fall in for a warm hug.


Back then, Rufus and I barely had time together, but he always made the few times we met worth it. He was the closest thing I had to a parent.


"How is this possible?" He inquired after asking how l was. "Your face... My goodness! You look gorgeous!You've only been gone for five years and... l-I can't believe this."
"It's a long story, Rufus. But for now, let's just say fates decided to smile on me."



"Oh, Lyric! You do not know how happy I am to see you.I am sure your father must be delighted seeing you're not...un-beautiful anymore." I laughed at his attempt not to use the word 'ugly' on me.


Well, as for my father, I rolled my eyes in my head.1felt a little sad that I was forced to return here after five years because of him. My life was perfect in Draconis.


"Here. I'll take this to the car," Rufus said, taking my luggage.


"You do that and I'll meet you in the car. I need to pick up an extra luggage. Don't worry, I'll be quick."


I turned around and had barely taken three separate Rufus called my attention, "You dropped something."


Looking at the floor, I found the scanned image. My heart jumped into my throat as I quickly crouched to retrieve it. Rufus watched with me with surprise. Obviously, he had seen the X-ray and would be wondering why the hell something of that nature had been in my back pocket.


Oh, Lyric. You couldn't be a little careful?


"It's-It's not mine," I cleared my throat, hoping my lie was plausible. I mean, who carried X-ray photos of fetuses in their back pocket?


Tucking it back into the pocket, I hurried away.







I had my hands crossed over my chest as I waited at the collecting center. My extra luggage would be brought to me at any moment.


As I waited idly, disturbing thoughts ran through my mind. Father wanted me home for two reasons. The first was to completely cut ties with Roderick.


In our world, when two wolves were getting mated,they tied a ribbon as a sign of their union and had it stored in a temple. So, when they wanted to part ways, there were two steps involved. First, they'd have to denounce themselves as mates with the words of their mouths, and secondly, cut the ribbon together.


After Roderick denounced me as his mate, we didn't get the chance to see each other again.Circumstances happened that pulled me away. But now, he was desperate to finish the final steps.Apparently, he'd chosen a new mate but couldn't accept her when he was still partially bound to me.


Well, I'd been looking forward to the day when I get to end things with the asshole. He was my past, and the stupid ribbon was the final thing holding us together.


"Excuse me, Ms. I'd like a moment of your time,please," someone said behind me.


I turned to see a well-built man in a black suit and dark shades over his eyes. I didn't need anyone to tell me he was a guard.


"Can I help you?" | furrowed my brows. "Kind of. The Alpha over there demands an audience with you."


I looked to where he pointed-a mini bar-but couldn't see the man he was referring to. His face was shielded by a counter.


I fought the urge to roll my eyes. These days, it was tiring. It was obvious there would never be a day where I'd step out without garnering attention from the opposite gender.


"I'm in a hurry. Tell him I'm sorry." I responded.


The guard's jaw tightened. "You can't ignore him." I read the unspoken words from his tone: He's a powerful Alpha.You can't simply ignore his request.


But I really wasn't interested in meeting anyone. "I'm sorry.I really am."


I looked away. It was disrespectful to ignore an Alpha's call. In a world where ranks mattered,he could be one of the powerful ones and could punish m e severely, but I really wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone.



"It's Alpha Roderick of Nightshade." The guard added as if to entice me. But he had no idea, he had just reopened old wounds.


My eyes moved to him, then quickly flicked to the bar where the man was seated. Roderick? As in my ex-mate Roderick? The one I was here to end things with? No way.


My chest tightened with pain and it was all I could do to keep my emotions intact.


"More reason not to see him," I mumbled, turning away.


"Did you say something?"


"I said I am not seeing him." I gritted the words, my nails digging into my palms.


The guard gave me a disapproving stare before walking away, and I released a shaky breath.


Now, where the hell was my luggage? I met one of the workers and demanded an update,and he assured me it'd be here any minute.


Unfortunately, they were not fast enough as shortly,I saw Roderick approaching me.
###Chapter 4
LYRIC


Roderick Fletcher.


The one man I'd hoped would love me but never did.


The mind was a bitch. I thought | was over Roderick's betrayal and wouldn't feel a thing when I met him.But watching him as he approached me, looking like he was the one in charge made my eyes rim with tears.


I sniffled and looked away, forcing the tears back in.


"So, I had to come over to speak to you myself," he leaned against the counter beside me. "How daring."



My throat was tight, unable to find any words.I feared there would be a crack in my voice if l managed to speak.


Three guards hovered beside him, their eyes darting around. Roderick looked sophisticated, like he'd obviously been having a good life.


What was he even doing here? Was he picking someone?



"What's the name?" He tilted his head as he asked.



I said nothing, won't even look at him.


"Hello?"



"I don't feel like disclosing my name to strangers,"|finally managed. My voice was tight.


His eyes beamed with amusement. And here was a man who never smiled at me when we were together for one year.


"Let's just say I'm overly excited today," he sighed."I'm here, waiting for a certain bitch to arrive." When I gave him a puzzled look,he added, "Ex-mate. We are through with the first step and just have the tiny little step to go. I'd finally be free of her."


I scoffed. He was unbelievable. "I'd have done this sooner, you know? But the horrid girl has been missing for years. Stressed us the hell out to find her." He spoke with raw disdain.


"What makes you call her horrid?" | found myself asking before I could stop.


He chuckled. "Trust me, honey; she's a monster.If you see her, you'd have the same opinion. She's the ugliest thing I've ever seen."


Something hot exploded in my chest. It was all I could do not to let my emotions rush out.


No. This was not the right place.


But Roderick was the true monster. He had no idea he was standing before the very woman he despised.What would proud he do if he gets to know?


It made sense why he was waiting at the airport.He clearly wanted to drag me to the temple to cut the ribbon. Well, I wouldn't let him humiliate me in public.Not again.


Fortunately, my luggage finally arrived. "Sorry for the delay, ma'am," the young man said as he rolled it to me.



Not looking at Roderick, I made to leave. That must have surprised him. "I'd love to speak to you some other time. Your contact, if you don't mind."


For a moment, I stood with my back to him,contemplating my words. I turned around when I found the most polite one | could give; "Even if I have to give up my number to save myself from you, l wouldn't do it. AIpha."


When my words sank in, surprise danced in her eyes,followed by a hint of hurt.


Something blossomed in my chest. It was pride.



So, I rolled my luggage away, leaving him standing there in shock.



****+****+



Rufus and I arrived home to the party. It was my stepmother's birthday party. Not that I had any intention of attending-may the moon forbid it-l just arrived at a coincidentally perfect time.



I wasn't dressed for the party. Had my simple jeans and shirt on with my hair in a ponytail. Yet, when l entered the hall, heads turned in my direction.


I felt awkward for a moment. The whole attention thing was still new to me.


I never knew I could receive so much compliments until I was free of my scar. Now, people could hardly stare at me without telling me how beautiful | was.


My stepsister, Nora, walked up to me with a smile."Hi! You're a little late for the party. What's your name?"



Typical Nora. From young, she's always wanted to be friends with the hot girls. She despised me so much as I brought a 'stain' to her name. A scarred lady being her sister.



Five years ago, she had slammed the door inh face, not letting me in despite my pleas. Now, she was being all nice.


"I'm not here for the party," I answered her coldly and looked away, scouring around for my father.


I found him in a corner with my stepmother and some guests. He was the reason I was here. I needed to know what was so urgent aside from cutting ties with Roderick.



He had his eyes on me, staring suspiciously.I went toward him.



"Hey! Who are you?" Nora came after me, sounding a little hurt.



But I ignored her until I reached father.


My father was a well known Alpha, hence the party filled with dignitaries. I did well to bow my head to them as I stood before father.


"Who are you?" My stepmother asked.


I met her gaze with a smirk. "Am I that different that you can't recognize me?" I looked to father. "What about you, father? Am I too different?"


Audible gasps rippled around me. Nora's hand went over her mouth.



"It's not possible," she muttered, shaking her head.


"Lyric?" Father's eyes were filled with shock and recognition.


"Who's this impersonator?" My stepmother snapped."Do you think we lack knowledge of what Lyric looks like? You think we'd fall for this scam?"


I focused my gaze on dad. "I'm only here 'cause you said there was something important you needed to talk to me about. If you don't mind, I'd like for us to have that conversation now."



Father took me to his study, leaving numerous shocked persons behind who couldn't utter a word.


I wouldn't deny how good it felt to know I was the reason they were speechless. They couldn't call me ugly. As a matter of fact, I'd never be called ugly by anyone, ever again.


"What happened to you, Lyric? Your scar was impossible to get rid of," Father asked.


"I don't wish to discuss it nowv." Or the horrible things that happened within five years. I was still trying to run from them. "Just tell me why you needed me here."



"Yes, that," his countenance soured. "You have no idea how happy I was when. I found you after searching for years. You just... vanished." He sighed."We have a problem, Lyric. Our Pack is in a deep mess with Darkspire. I-I made some mistake and lost a lot of money-a whole lot-making me indebted to Darkspire."



Okay, I did not like where this was headed.


Darkspire was a generational wolf pack, known to produce only the strongest Alphas. The Alphas that always ranked first in the hierarchy system. They were avoided as much as possible as they were known to be vicious. One did not get tangled with them for any reason.


"If word of this gets out, we'd be doomed. We'd go down the ranks, and coming from a pack that was used to being at the top, believe me, it is not a good thing for us. But they're willing to let it go."


I furrowed my brows. It didn't make any sense.I sensed a huge 'But' coming.


"But they need a Luna from this family, for just a year."
###Chapter 5
LYRIC


It had to be a joke. Or at the very least, not what l was thinking.


Father's eyes turned more serious as he moved toward me. "I thought of offering Nora to him, but she's already with someone else, and the Alpha King might become furious if he thinks we're trying to offer him someone else's woman. This is the reason you're the only choice we have, Lyric. And...you have no idea how perfect it is that you have your face back. Initially, I had been worried we'd have issues with the Alpha King accepting you, but now, I am confident he'll be thrilled."


"Hold on," I scoffed, placing a hand on my thigh."Please don't tell me you made me travel all the way from Draconis just to be told that I am about to be sacrificed to a demon." No wolf was stranger to the name ' Darkspire'.Even me who knew little of Pack matters still knew how dangerous they were and nobody wanted to have anything to do with them; not in this life, not in another.



"Alpha Jaris is not a demon," Father said with surprise.


"But that is exactly what he is. Years ago, you said the same thing."


Alpha Jaris Dreadmoor was the most vicious man I'd ever heard about. Tales of how he had conquered his enemies-and sometimes, his friends-were no news to the Pack. Being from a family that produced only the strongest Alphas, he was currently the Alpha King of Darkspire, a man everyone feared and didn't wish to end in his bad books. I didn't know what he looked like. I'd never been privileged enough to meet someone like Jaris Dreadmoor. Not that I ever wanted to.



"There are rumors that he killed his own father and brother!" | raised my hand in the air. "How do you want me to be with someone like that?"


"Those are mere speculations, Lyric. Besides,you'll only be with him for a year."


"You don't need a year to kill someone, dad. All it takes is a minute, tops. But for someone like Jaris,I'm sure half a minute would do. Besides,why does it even have to be for a year?"


From what I heard, Darkspire didn't have a Luna yet since Jaris' rise to ascension. But if he wanted to take up a Luna, wouldn't it be long term or something? Why was he only asking for a year?


"Honestly, I don't know, Lyric."


"And you don't care," I cut in, pain edging toward my heart. "All you care about is giving him a Luna so you can get the problem off your back. You don't care about the problem you're putting on mine."



For a fraction of a second, wonder flashed across his face. The Lyric he knew would never argue with him.She'd have humbly agreed to anything he wanted. Well, let's just say I got to know my worth when l realized how beautiful | was. This Lyric was tired of being people's puppets.


Father came close enough to take my hand. This time, he looked so troubled, I feared he might go on his knees.



"Lyric, please." He gave my hand a little squeeze."This is the last I'll ask of you as your father. Just do this for me, for only a year. And I promise, you'll make me the happiest father."

Hours later, I stood in my room-or what used to be my room-staring at my reflection in the mirror. I was wearing a long red dress with my hair falling over my shoulder.I was fully ready to meet Alpha Jaris, even though I'd rather | don't.


Something didn't feel right. Him wanting a Luna for only a year....it was wrong. But father had nearly gone on his knees begging me earlier. I could disappoint him. Besides, before he got mated to his second wife, there were times he'd been good to me.



| tried to resist the temptation as I stared at the drawer before me. But failing woefully, I still opened it and retrieved the scan. My heart fractured completely, old wounds reopening.


It was the one picture in the world that had the power to kill me every single time I looked at it, yet it was like a drug to me. I was addicted and could barely go an hour without touching it. Feeling it.



A tear dropped from my eye as I glided my finger across the images outlining the shapes of the unborn babies in the womb.



Five years, yet still the best thing that's happened to me.And the worse. But I'd rather hold onto the fact that it was the best.


It hurt so bad staring at them, but | couldn't stop.


The sound of someone trying to open my door broke into my thoughts. I jerked back to reality and quickly hid the picture. I'd made sure to lock the door a while ago, not wanting anyone to see me with the photo.


Getting the door, I found Nora, fuming.


"How did you get rid of your scar?" Her voice blared with indignation. "And what exactly is your plan? You want everyone to see the beautiful you, don't you?"


I rolled my eyes, my earlier pain dissolving temporarily. "Please, don't tell me you knocked on my door just to whine about how good I look.What,you really thought I'd look that heinous forever?"


Her glare turned even icier. "Well, just so you know,this won't change a thing between you and Roderick.Soon, he'll be here, both of you would go to the temple and finish your breakup."



It dawned on me instantly. Oh, no.


"Wait," I blinked. "You and Roderick?"



A triumphant smile played on her lips. "Years ago,things didn't work between us. But now, he's ready to choose me." Well, if Roderick wasn't a bigger bastard.


"Ugh, you disappoint me, Nora. Using my leftovers?"I tsked. "Considering you've always thought yourself the pretty one, I expected better from you."


A tense glare pulled her brows together. She opened her mouth to say something, but I caught her off."You don't have to worry. I'm done with Roderick and can't wait to fully end things with him." I slammed the door in her face.







A while later, father and I arrived Darkspire in one of his luxury cars. The Pack, which was known to be the biggest and wealthiest, was just as beautiful as people said.



I was dazzled by the sight and couldn't believe for a moment that I'd be Luna here.


Alighting our car, father and I were led into one of the buildings by some maids while his guards remained outside. The Grand Luna-Jaris' mother-was in the large living room to welcome us.



"Bennett! I am so glad you made it," the Luna said,her eyes holding little amusement.


"Greetings, Luna." | dipped my head.


She regarded me with surprise. "Is this your daughter?" She asked dad. "Well, bless Seraphis,she's gorgeous!"


I couldn't help my smile. Luna Isolde, during her time,was a formidable Luna. She had ruled beside her late husband with an iron fist, destroying everyone who dared cross her path. I'd always wished to meet her.


"Please, come sit while we wait for Alpha Jaris.He'll be joining us shortly," she showed us to the couch.


Her version of 'shortly' turned out to be almost an hour later. Father and I were already exhausted and kept staring at the door, wondering how long it'd take the Alpha to arrive. Wasn't he aware he'd be having guests? His...new Luna? At a point, Isolde looked angry and left. When she returned, she reassured us he'd soon be here. And indeed,he did come.


The air shifted in the room the second the door opened,revealing a man and two others behind him.


The Luna drew in a breath of relief as she rose to her feet. Father and I did same.


It was easy spotting who the Alpha was as the two other men flanked him. But the moment I had a clear view of his face, my world shattered.


No.No.


Horror gripped my chest, squeezing it until | felt pain.This had to be some twisted joke. Because how in Selene's name was I staring at the face of the very man that had ruined me five years ago?
###Chapter 6
"Jaris, you're here." Isolde said with relief. "Please,meet Alpha Bennett of Ravencrest. This is his daughter we talked about."


I'd stopped breathing since he walked in. In that moment, nothing else, other than the pain in my chest seemed to exist.



Memories I'd been fighting so hard to stay buried reared their ugly heads at me. And the name 'Princess' echoed in my head, hauntingly, I wanted to scream.



He had been Jaris? Alpha of Darkspire? | couldn't believe this.


Unlike that night, when he looked at me with those charming eyes and called me beautiful, his eyes were very cold now; devoid of emotion. He didn't look like the man I'd wanted to spend an extra day with. He looked ruthless, like a man I wanted to run as far away as possible from.


Now it made sense. That night, he'd only been sweet 'cause he wanted to deceive me. Oh, how foolish l had been. And how he must have laughed at me when I lay my head on his chest. He must have been disgusted too.


I contemplated running. I didn't want to be with him;didn't want to be his Luna.



But before I could make a move, he walked away, not without giving me an icy stare.


Luna Isolde looked taken aback and embarrassed.



"Um.Ex-Excuse me." She went after him.



Father and I returned to our seats. But unlike him, I was battling to hold back my tears.


It hurt. So so bad. He had been a monster like everyone else and had deceived me. I never thought I'd see him again.


I suddenly realized how disrespectful he had been to father. My father was an older Alpha, yet he hadn't even acknowledged him.


My head was a jumbled mess. I couldn't do this.


I rose to my feet and started toward the door.


"Lyric?" Dad's voice halted me. "Where are you going?"


When I looked at him, I suddenly didn't have the courage to tell him I was done with this.


"l-I just need to use the restroom."


"I'll show you, ma'am," a maid stepped forward wearing a warm smile.


I filled her up the stairs to the second floor where l was shown to a row of restrooms. As soon as I shut the door behind me, I burst into tears, my facade finally dissolving.


I leaned against the door and cried for a long time,letting it all out-the pain, the rejection. I'd only known him for a night, yet his betrayal had cut deeper than anything else. After getting my scar, he was the first man to ever make me feel loved, and the first to take it away so quickly. It'd have been better if he had never said those words to me and made me think he was different.



I had to put it behind me. It was a thing of the past now. I shouldn't let it bother me this much.


When I was done getting the tears out, I wiped my face and left the room. The maid was gone.



I was trying to find my way back to the ground floor when I heard tiny running footsteps and turned to see a little kid running toward me.



My brows furrowed, and for a strange reason, there was a sharp ache in my heart.


She couldn't be older than four or five years of age.She had familiar silver eyes, hair styled into a ponytail and was the most beautiful kid l'd seen in a long time. But she looked sad as she ran toward me.



She stopped in front of me, having to tilt her head back to stare into my face. "Aunty, can you help my brother?"


I stared at her in amazement. "Your brother? Is he in trouble?"


More to my surprise, she took one of my fingers and began pulling me toward the direction she had come from.


Okay, this was odd. I didn't even know who she was or where she'd come from. But for her to come to me for help, her brother must needit. I'd be helping a little kid.



As I followed her, I glanced down at the part where our hands were joined. Why did I feel so at ease with her touching me? Why did she feel so...familiar?


"Uh...what kind of trouble is your brother in, honey?"Iasked.


"A serious one." She sounded so sad. Now, I was curious.



We finally got to a door which she pushed open, and the moment I stepped into the room and saw what she had brought me in to see, my body froze.
###Chapter 7 
LYRIC


On the bed was a young boy, just about the girl's age,shaking profusely.


It wasn't shivering kind of shake. He looked like someone who was in hell.


His forehead was beaded with sweat, and his tiny hands were fisted around the sheets. I didn't think I'd seen a little child in so much pain before.



"My goodness, what is wrong with him?" | asked,alarmed, as I ran to meet him in the bed.


His eyes were tightly shut, small grunts of pain escaping his throat.



"It happens to him often but it's getting worse by the day. I don't know where mummy went, and daddy's busy. I can't go to him." Touching the boy's forehead, it was as hot as burning coal, I almost hissed. For the love of Selene,he was in a terrible state! A child like him didn't deserve to go through this.


I should be finding a way to get him to his parents to take him to a doctor, but I think I might know what to do.


I turned to the little girl to ask her something,only to discover she was crying. A part of my heart fractured.



"Don't worry, honey, he'll be fine. I'll make him fine,"|said, hoping that would assure her. "I just need your help gathering some things."


With her help, I was able to get a bowl of warm water from the bathroom andsome napkins.


I sat on the bed, lifted the boy's head onto my legs and gently massaged his forehead with one of the napkins which l'd dipped into the bowl. I repeated the process for a while, the whole time, praying to the protectors of the moon to help him.
By the time I finished with the napkin, he was a bit calmer. I moved to massage the back of his head, a spot in particular. This should do the final trick.


In a few minutes, the boy had stopped shaking and looked like he was in a simple nap. Being calmer,I was able to see how handsome he looked. His hair looked so lustrous and perfect that for a moment,was tempted to tousle it.


"He looks fine," the little girl said.


"What's your name?"


"Xyla," she blushed, amusing me.


"That's a pretty name."


More to my amusement, her cheeks became increasingly rosy. She was such a cute little girl.


"Do your parents go to work? Is that why they aren't here?" | was curious to know why the boy was alone when he was clearly sick.



"Mummy goes to work sometimes, but daddy's here. My father is the Alpha."


It was like a canon blast rang out in my skull. My fingers which were still massaging the boy's head instantly froze, my pulse quickening.


I looked at the girl, wide-eyed. "Y-Your father is Alpha Jaris?"


She nodded, wearing a smile like she was proud of it.


My world came crumbling down.


No, this was not possible. Jaris had kids!? And possibly a lover?


It was not supposed to be a problem, but these kids looked like five-year-olds the exact time he had slept with me, right before he abandoned me in the morning.


So, he already had a family when he met me at the bar? What did that say about him? He was a cheat?


"Are you alright, aunty?" The little girl asked,snapping me back to reality. Staring at her now made me a little emotional. Of course, there had never been any hope for Jaris and me. He already had a beautiful family to start with.


"I'm fine, sweetheart." I managed a smile.


I couldn't help but wonder who their mother was. She must have been prettier than I was five years ago.How could Jaris have left her for me?



I wouldn't have had an issue with him abandoning me in the morning if he hadn't given me hope that night.He had called me beautiful and even asked for an extra day. But in the end, he was just like the others.This whole thing had been a mistake.



The door suddenly opened, happening just in time to stop my stupid tears from spilling. A young woman,who looked about my age, entered, wearing a long pretty dress.


She froze at the door, her face contorting in a frown as she looked at me like I was a ghost.


"Who are you?" Her voice when she spoke was smooth, hinting at a woman wvho had been privileged in life.



The little boy was still asleep on my legs. I was afraid to wake him up with any slight movement.


"Hi. I'm Lyric," I said with a small smile. Who was she?



"I don't give a hoot about your name, lady. What the hell are you doing in here? And why are you holding my son?"


It crashed over me like an unexpected wave, leaving me reeling for some seconds.Oh,wow...


She was Jaris' lover. Of course, he must love her to have kids with her.


As gently as possible, I lifted the little boy's head onto a pillow and stood.


"Do I have to call the guards on you?" The lady asked, her tone not friendly one bit.


Before | could respond, Xyla did. "I called her mummy. Xylon was having one of his crises and needed help. I was on my way to get help when l found her in the passage."



The lady huffed. "So, you invite strangers into your room? Where did you learn that, Xyla?"


There was something about the way the lady communicated with the kid that made me uncomfortable. Even the little girl slightly recoiled.


Her gaze sharp, she turned back to me. "I think you're grown enough to know better than to listen to what kids say. It was wrong of you have follow a little girl in here."



"Okay... But I had to save a suffering child. Wasn't that worth it?" What was her problem? I thought she'd be appreciative or something.


She rolled her eyes. "It's not like you can do anything for him. I have been the one taking care of Xylon since his crisis began. Nobody has been able to help him other than me." "But the aunty was able to help him, mummy," the little girl said. "And Xylon got better immnediately.I'd never seen him recover so quickly."


I watched surprise flicker through the lady's eyes.She looked at the boy on the bed again, and this time, there was a certain recognition in her eyes, like she was just noticing he was indeed better.

###Chapter 8

"It must be mere luck," she cleared her throat. "I'm sure she didn't have to do much."



I was tempted to laugh. Mere luck? Did she have any idea the effort I had to put in?


She stepped away from the door. "Leave. Now."


For a spitting second, I wondered why Jaris wasn't making her his Luna. She looked beautiful and already had kids for him.



"I'm sorry l invaded your kids' privacy. The little boy just needed help, and I thought it'd be wrong to ignore him." Dipping my head, I left the room.


JARIS



I knew what would happen the moment I walked out on them. My mother was never one to let things go,especially not this. Although, for the first time, I wish she'd get off my back.


My beta Kael, and head of security Nerion, waited outside my room. I was trying to take off my accessories when she entered, her eyes anything but pleased.


"What're you doing, Jaris? We've been waiting for over an hour."


I know she was angry enough to want to yell, but my mother knew better than to yell at me. It wasn't an action that was appreciated by me.


"| didn't ask anyone to wait," I answered without looking at her as I unstrapped my watch.


"Oh, come on! We've discussed this already. It is important you have a Luna at this time."


"Well, pardon me, mother, if I'm not too eager to bond with someone I feel nothing for and never will."


"And nobody's asking you to feel anything for her. As a matter of fact, it's only going to be for a year!Bennett's daughter is the only necessity that you are well aware of. In a year, we'll be through wvith her-that is, if she survives-and truthfully, you know I don't care.


But you only have to put up with her for a year,Jaris.Hopefully, before then, we'd have found your mate,and she would become the true Luna of the people."I did not miss the smile that crossed her face."Everything would be perfect. Just do this, please.Besides, the elders are beginning to talk. We have to get them off our backs. It's like killing two birds with one stone."



"I'm tired, mother. Let's save this riveting talk for later, when I can actually pretend to care," I cut her off, honestly tired of hearing her say things | didn't want to hear.


"Fine. I'll go. But you need to see her, at least," she spoke the words like a bargain.


I knew my mother had a point. I urgently needed a Luna for two reasons, but the thought of being with someone | felt absolutely nothing for irritated me.I didn't want to be with anyone. "Let her go. I do not want to see her. Not now, at least."



"Jaris..."



"I'm done with this conversation. And trust me,mother, my ability to stay polite is slipping fast." My tone had no room for further argument, and my gaze when I looked at her was icy.


I couldn't exactly be faulted. Growing up, I've always hated to be controlled. And when I finally became Alpha, it grew worse. I didn't like anyone telling me what to do. I also didn't like to be disobeyed. If it wasn't for the fact that she was my mother, there would have been repercussions.


Finally, she did leave, giving me some space.


I finished undressing and changed into a simpler outfit for the night. I hada lot of work to do, but my mood had already been ruined. So, I simply took a seat at my study table.


Beside me, there was a safe. Inputting my passcode, I took out the photo. A certain calm enveloped me,but at the same time, I felt a sharp sting.


After five years, I couldn't believe | was yet to get over her. Who was she and what did she do to make me so addicted? Why did she have to hurt me the way she did?


I traced my fingers along the outline of her face. It was a faint image of her leaving the hotel that morning. It wasn't clear, but it was better than having nothing.


It was just an image, yet it meant the world to me.Whatever happened to her? Was she dead? Because for five years, I'd been searching for her but to no avail.


If only my mother could understand that I felt nothing for Bennett's daughter or my fated mate she's been desperately searching for.


In our world, seeing your fated mate was rare. Most times, we had to choose a person we were attracted to. I'd found my fated mate nine years ago, but lost her before we could even bond. And since then,mother had been keen on finding her. But I didn't care even about her.


The only woman I cared about was the very one in my hand.


My princess.


She was the one I wanted to make my permanent Luna.Where did she go?


＊＊＊＊十



Hours later, when I was sure the unwanted guests were gone, I left to check on the kids. Fortunately,Xyla and Xylon were playing on the bed with Xyla giggling 'cause she was winning.


My heart warmed up at the sight-my favorite sight.These days, they were the only reason I get to experience true joy, even if I could hardly express it.


Marta was by the side of the room, mixing something in a bowl. And I didn't miss the interest that sparked in her eyes when she saw me. Upon seeing me, the kids jumped out of bed.


"Daddy! Are you donefor the day?" Xyla asked.


She did most of the talking as Xylon had problems expressing himself.


For the next one minute, we had a light conversation on how both our days went.


"Daddy, Xylon had one of his crises today," Xyla said,shattering the tiny peace I felt.


"Did you?" I looked at him, running my fingers through his hair.


His gaze dropped to the floor, indicating his sadness.


It was always a torment for him, and it broke me each time he suffered it without remedy.


For years, I'd employed the best doctors from all over the world to treat him, not none had been able to help. It was devastating that there were certain things my wealth and title could not solve.


"But he had quickly gotten better!" Xyla expressed. "Unlike before, he didn't suffer for much today."



My brows furrowed. "Okay. What happened?"



"Someone treated him."
###Chapter 9
JARIS



Someone else treated Xylon? How did that happen without my knowledge?


And was it really effective like Xyla claimed?


Xylon had been suffering from this for years. No one has been able to help.


"Who was it?" | asked, more interested than ever.


"Oh, silly Xyla," Marta suddenly cut in, chuckling."Did you really have to call me someone else? You want it to be a surprise?"


Holding a cup of what she had been mixing, she approached Xylon with it, urging him to drink.


"Xyla just wants it to be a surprise, Jaris. I actually came up with a new formula, and thankfully, it worked. Right, Xyla?" She offered a smile and touched Xyla's hair with tenderness. "Why don't you go get some water for your brother,honey?"


Xyla stood up and left without saying a word. She looked uncomfortable.



"So,it was you?"|asked Marta.


"Of course. Who else would come into the kids'room?"



It made sense. No one would enter to treat Xylon without my permission. Besides, Marta was the head doctor at the Central Pack Hospital, and she had been working tirelessly to find a solution for Xylon's health. It was believable that she might be close to finding one.


"So," she cleared her throat, folding her hands while her eyes dropped to the floor. "I heard you had a guest today. Your future Luna."


Okay, that was it. I wasn't ready for another conversation that would get me into a worse mood.


"I'm not doing this, Marta."
"Why can't I be enough for you and your mother?"There was a crack in her voice. "Come on, Jaris! I've given you two kids. An heir! How do you and your mother despise me so much?"


"I told you from the onset that bearing these kids was not going to be enough to make you my Luna.Don't get me wrong, I love my kids with every fiber of my being, but we didn't agree on them before you became pregnant, Marta. And I made it clear to you that I had no intention, whatsoever, of making you my Luna. So, quit trying to play the victim card."


Making someone like Marta my Luna would be a big mistake. She was vile, poorly mannered and hardly cared for others. While I was most of these things,I couldn't have a Luna that was just like me. Two monsters could not exist.



I had actually been shocked when she took in. Like it was with every woman, I had not been able to finish with her. But then, it wasn't medically impossible for her to take in even without me coming. And it felt good to have the one thing I never thought I could  have. But it still wasn't enough to make someone like her my Luna.


Her eyes became teary, and I knew I had to leave to avoid any more of her dramas.


"Come to my room when you're free, okay?" | said to Xylon who nodded happily.


It dawned on me that his mother and I just had an inappropriate discussion in front of him.


Damn it.


Tousling his hair, I left the room.


LYRIC



And here I was, thinking my new face could never be rejected.Apparently, Alpha Jaris was an exception.


It stung when his mother returned and told us the Alpha was busy but promised to get back to us.l didn't need anyone to tell me it was a polite way of saying "he is not interested."


Well, maybe it was a good thing, because I didn't 
think I was interested in him anymore. He was a liar,rude and arrogant. I didn't want to be with someone like that.



Father was clearly disappointed. The entire ride home, he didn't say a word to me.


Reaching home, Nora stormed toward me, looking furious.



"Why did you have to take so long to come home?Roderick was here and ready to take you to the temple. But he got tired of waiting!" She stomped her feet like the spoiled brat that she was.


"Tune it down, Nora. She was with me, don't forget,"father said, putting a rein on her anger, though she rolled her eyes.


"You'd better be home tomorrow. He'll be here again to take you to the temple." She huffed. "I wish you were here to see how eager he was to end this silly thing with you."


"I am just as eager, Nora. You don't have to worry; l have no intentions of taking back something l rejected." I turned to leave.


"Drop the illusion, Lyric. He rejected you first." Nora's words wounded me, freezing me to the spot.


For a moment, I felt the bitter reminder of a pain I'd been trying to bury.


Without sparing her a glance, I walked away.


＊＊＊＊＋＊＊＊＊＋＊＊＊＊十



JARIS



Xyla and Xylon came over to spend some time with me when they were done with their mother. They simply played with their tabs while I focused on some tasks.



But the whole time, I noticed Xyla was unhappy.


When it was their bedtime, one of their nannies came over to take them to the room.



I pulled Xyla aside. "Is something wrong?"She remained silent, dropping her gaze to the floor.


"You know you can tell me anything. Do you need something? Anything at all?"



She shook her head. "I am just worried about Xylon."



"What about him?"



"I'm afraid his crisis will return and no one will be around to help him. For the first time today, someone was able to treat him in minutes. It'd be nice if she could be around more often to help him."



Someone? "Are you referring to mum?"


She shook her head, then glanced back at the door suspiciously. Xylon and the nanny were waiting outside.



"Mummy told me not to tell you, but I'm worried about Xylon. Mummy wasn't the one that had taken care of him today," she revealed, surprising me. "It was one beautiful aunty. She had been wearing a red dress." Red dress. My thoughts spun.


Hold on. Alpha Bennett's daughter!?
###Chapter 10
LYRIC



I woke up feeling better than I'd slept the previous night. I made a mental calculation of the things l needed to do.


Since father's union with Darkspire didn't work out,it was safe for me to return to Draconis, right?


Draconis was a human country. Over there, I had a job, good human friends, and kind neighbours. It was nothing like the chaotic and violent world of the wolves, and I'd very much love to return to it.


I concluded on telling father about it before the end of today. I'll also end my final mate bond with Roderick, then I'll be free. My life would go back to being perfect.


My heart was light with joy as I freshened up and decided to drive out for breakfast. Of course, there were tons of food in the house, but I felt like cruising around the Pack-one last time, at least. My father's pack wvas quite beautiful.


But just as my car turned onto the street, a ridiculously bright red car swerved right into my lane,nearly slamming into me. I had to stomp on the brakes so hard I thought I'd snap my foot off.The seatbelt yanked me back, saving me from kissing the steering wheel.


Now, who the hell was this blind oof? You've got to be kidding me!


The offending car just sat there, far too close to mine, as if daring me to lose my temper. WVell,congratulations, buddy-you won. Fury bubbling under my skin, I threw open my door and stomped over, ready to give them a piece of my mind.


"Hey!" I knocked on the tinted window. "What are you doing? You almost hit me!"


I couldn't see who it was yet, but obviously, it had to be an arrogant, mannerless twerp. The front door finally opened, and out stepped a man in dark shades, leaning casually against the car like he'd just parked in a VIP spot at the Oscars.


"You're lucky I didn't run into you completely,'cause trust me, that was my intention," he drawled in a grumpy tone.


What? Was he kidding me?


"Are you-" I paused, instantly realizing how familiar he looked.



There was somethingabout his cocky smirk and perfectly messy dark hair that struck a chord.


I furrowed my brows, trying to recall where I'd seen him. And then, like lightning, it struck me.


"Jace!?"



The grin that spread across his face could've rivaled a toothpaste commercial. He pulled off his shades dramatically, tossing them onto the dashboard like he was auditioning for a rom-com. Then, in the most exaggerated announcer voice, he declared, "Ding-ding-ding! Give the lady a prize! Took you long enough, Lyric. I was beginning to think your memory got fried in the crash that almost happened. Come here!"



Before I could stop myself, I burst into laughter-the kind that makes your stomach hurt-and practically threw myself into his arms.


＊＊＊＊＋＊＊＊＊十



Jace and I were childhood friends, long before | got my scar. He was the one person who never shied away from me, although at some point, he became inconsistent as he was away to a new country. I was devastated when he left 'cause he had been the one true friend I had left.


We haven't seen each other in over fifteen years.I was surprised when he could recognize me without my scar. Apparently, Rufus had taken a picture of me at the airport and had it sent to him.


"So,how have you been, Lyric? I haven't seen you in like, what, thirty years?" Jace said as he locked some whipped cream off his fingers. We were in a cozy little restaurant by the window, sharing breakfast.


"Jace! I'm only twenty-five." I rolled my eyes at him.


"Alright, fine. But you've grown into one beautiful woman, Lyric. Like, literally," he pointed at my face,making me laugh.


I let my gaze roam over him like I was just seeing him for the first time. "You too, Bee. You've grown into a fine young man."


And I was serious. He has really worked on his body and developed alI the abs and...


"Hey, we're adults now. Stop calling me that name."He stabbed his finger in the air toward me.


I couldn't help but laugh. He'd always hated that name.


We talked about so many things, including how Roderick had used and dumped me.


"I swear, if I ever see that slimy Alpha, I'll rearrangehis face," Jace fumed.



"I'm afraid you can't. He's one of the most powerful Alphas now," I rolled my eyes, although my heart hurt from the truth.



"And my father's the Lycan Chairman-don't forget that."



Well, that also was true. Jace's father had the power to declare war on a Pack. Apparently, Jace was his heir and would be taking over once his father retires.



But then, there was no need for a war.


"So, have you found someone yet?" I asked a while later, wanting to change the topic.


Jace had always had issues sustaining a relationship with a woman. It was one of the problems I worried about for him.



"Nah. Believe me, Lyric, I've tried. I've given a lot of bitches too many chances, but it's just not working out. I don't know." He shrugged. "Maybe it's because you're not trying enough. You're too flirty to stay committed, Jace."


"Uh-uh. Trust me, I've tried, Ly."


Suddenly, there was a certain interruption.


The restaurant suddenly went quiet as two men walked into the place, two men whose presence screamed power.


They had the build of guards with faces as hard as rocks. I recognized them in an instant. They had been with Jaris yesterday.



My heart skipped a beat. Was it a coincidence that they were walking towards our table?


"Uh... Do those guys think we have an extra seat here or something?" Jace asked, watching with suspicion.


The two men finally came to a stop before us.


"A warm morning to you, Ms. Harper,"' the first one spoke. He looked kinder than the other. deeply sorry we have to interrupt this moment, but we'll need you to come with us."


Huh?



"Do I know you? Jace asked, squinting up at them."Wait, are you with one of those cults that sells essential oils? Because if you are, we're gonna have to pass-our pyramid scheme plate is already full."


The first man ignored him and kept his eyes on me.


"Why?" | demanded.


"Alpha Jaris seeks an audience."



The name affected me to my core.


Wow. Was he finally ready to see me? Maybe he wanted to finally accept the contract? But shouldn't they have reached out to father first?


"Why does he want to see me?" I looked up at them.


"You'll have to come with us to get an answer to that question,Ms." My hand tightened around my fork.


No. I'd already made up my mind on what I needed to do. I was going back to Draconis, back to my normal life.I was done with the people here.


My jaw tightening, I forced the words out. "I'm sorry,but I'm not seeing him. You can tell him I've changed my mind."
###Chapter 11
LYRIC



The men stared at me, like I'd just told them the moon was made of cheese.



"What did you say?" The second man spoke for the first time. He was the grumpiest between the two.


"I'm sorry," I dropped my eyes. "But I really don't want to see him."



"Are you telling us to deliver a message to Alpha Jaris? You expect us to tell him you refused to honor his request?" The second man, asked, stepping closer.


Okay, I'll admit it. He was handsome-if "handsome"meant looking like you wrestled mountains for fun-but he was intimidating as hell.


"Hey, I'm sure she was clear enough," Jace spoke up before I could. "Why don't you tell your Alpha to send chocolates or flowers next time? Girls love that stuff."



But the men didn't look like they were there for jokes.


"You're coming with us. This instant," the second man said in a tone that brooked no room for further argument.


But I wasn't changing my mind.


To my shock, he grabbed my hand, though, to befair,his touch was surprisingly gentle for a guy who looked like he could crush boulders.



"Hey! Get that hand off her!" Jace shot up so fast he nearly knocked off his chair.


No. No. I didn't like where this was headed.


"Why don't you stay out of this, Mr.whoever-you-have? This is no business of yours." The second man grumped. He was too rude, unlike the first man.


"That's where you're wrong. She's my best friend,SO it's my fucking business." "Kael," the first man called, tapping his partner on the shoulder.


Kael. So, that was his name.


But Kael didn't seem like he was done. Whoever he was, he had serious temper issues.


He remained focused on Jace. "If you don't step back this instant, I'll make you regret it."


"What happens if I step forward, then? Do l get a gift card?" Jace took a step toward him.


| stood up, trying to defuse the situation, but it wNas too late. Kael swung, landing a clean punch to Jace's jaw.


And right there, the two men got engaged in a heated brawl.


They threw punches at each other, crashing over tables, breaking cups, flower vases and important items.



The restaurant turned into a full-room circus. It took the intervention of stronger men to be able to pull them apart. Kael's partner held him firmly when they were separated while I did same to Jace.


"We're leaving!" Kael's partner angrily said, and it wasn't a suggestion.


"This isn't over!" Kael spat out, wiping off blood from his lips with the back of his hand.


Jace wasn't in a better state.


Fortunately,they left.


"Are you alright?" | turned quickly to Jace, holding his face.


"I'm fine. Just tell me my nose is still cute. Is my nose still cute, Lyric?" He looked genuinely worried.


Geez,it was difficult staying angry around Jace, even when you're aware that your situation just got fucked.



JARIS


I'd just finished an intense meeting with the elders and retired to my room to get changed.


I found Marta in when I arrived, seated on my bed.


My spirits dampened. "You don't get to come in here without my permission, Marta. I thought I'd made that clear enough?"


"I'm sorry," she rose from the bed. "I just had some good news to share and wanted to wait for you."


Not asking what it was, I ambled to the table where l poured myself a glass of wine.


"Aren't you... curious to know what the good news is?"


I could tell she was hurt from her tone.


"When were you going to tell me the truth?" | asked instead, my back still turned to her. "The truth that someone else had treated Xylon, not you?"


When she said nothing, I turned around to see her looking pale.


"Uh..," she cleared her throat. "What're you talking about,Jaris?"


"I always find out the truth. You of all people should know this, Marta." I pinned her with my gaze,taking in her nervousness. "Were you so eager to take the glory and get commended by me? Does our son's health mean that little to you?"


"Jaris, no. It's-It's not whatyou think."


"I know you always want to be the best, Marta. But if there's someone out there who can help our son,shouldn't you be happy as the mother?"


She stuttered but formed no words.



I emptied my drink down my throat and slammed the glass on the table. This was one of the many reasons I could never make her my Luna. She was too selfish.Even to her own children.


"I'm sorry," her pride was a hard pill to swallow. "It was wrong of me."



There was a knock on the door. "Leave," I dismissed her.


I caught the hint of tears in her eyes before she exited the room.



Her presence was quickly replaced by Kael and Nerion.




Kael looked like he'd fought off some rogues himself.I didn't need anyone to tell me the mission was trash.


"She wouldn't come with us," Nerion supplied when l asked.


I was numb for a moment, but when the words registered, it came off like a blow to my face.


"What're you talking about?" My brows furrowed.


"Sorry, Alpha. We tried to talk to her. Kael even got into a fight with a friend of hers trying to bring her here.She said she's... no longer interested."


Now, he was joking.


But as seconds passed and no one laughed, I realized he was serious. My hand closed around my glass so tightly that it cracked.


Angrily, I threw it on the floor.


Rejection. How dare she reject me? My whole life,I'd never been rejected by anyone, ever. Who did she think she was?


"Kael, tell Astrid to cancel the rest of my schedule for today," I instructed. "Nerion, get the cars ready.We're heading out."


Nerion appeared surprised. "Where are we going?"


"Where do you think? Bennett's Pack."
###Chapter 12
LYRIC



Jace and I went our separate ways when we finished at the restaurant.



When I got home, I was met with an unpleasant surprise. Well, not really a surprise since I knew he'd be coming.



There in the living room was Roderick. Ex-mate.



He had been busy with his phnone, but the moment he saw me, he couldn't look away.


"Finally, you did come." Nora rolled her eyes, rising to her feet.



Roderick was still staring at me, seeming surprised.


"I know you," he suddenly muttered. "From the airport." I watched Nora's body language grow uncomfortable.




"Um... Roderick," she sat next to him, taking his hand. "This is Lyric. She's here now. So, let's go get this over with."



I did not miss how tense she looked.



Roderick's countenance clouded with confusion. He looked at Nora like she was insane, then at me.


Wearing a smile, I ultimately said. "Hello, Roderick.It's a good thing we finally met, because I've been as eager as you to get this over with. Let's go."


I turned toward the door. I wasn't even going to change or anything. I was longing for that.


"I don't understand," Roderick said, standing up."How can she be Lyric? She's..." he chuckled. "She can't-"



"I wasn't born ugly, Rodrick, just in case you're forgetting. All I had to do was get rid of my scar. But,don't worry, it's the same Lyric standing before you.I still remember your favorite words: 'Don't look at me.'Your face disgusts me'. 'Get out of my Pack'." I shrugged."See? Same me."


His eyes widened like saucers. For someone as rigid as Roderick, the sight was golden.


I continued to the door and soon opened it. But l paused when I noticed Roderick wasn't following.


"I have things to do, Roderick. Please, we need to get moving."


He lowered his gaze, seeming uncertain. Suddenly,he took his phone, tapping on the screen.


"Uh... something just came up. l-I have to go somewhere now."


Wow. Roderick stuttered. But what the hell was he talking about?


"Babe," Nora drew close. "Anything can wait. We've been waiting for ages now."


"It can't wait," he nearly slapped at her. Looking at me, his gaze softened. But there was guilt in his eyes.





"We'll finish this later," he muttered and walked past me,out the door.


****+



As expected, Nora was displeased with Roderick's dismissal, as was I. I was more than eager to get this thing past me.


Hours later, I met father to tel him of my plans of returning to Draconis. As expected, he didn't take it well.


"You just got back, Lyric. Besides, we still have the pending agreement with Darkspire."


"I'm not interested in Alpha Jaris anymore." It was difficult getting the words out, but I had to. "I'm sorry, father, but I really want to leave."


Seeing him again had brought me too much pain.I just wanted to go back to my normal life in Draconis. Father's face paled. I couldn't help feeling pity for him.



He was about to say something when two guards rushed in, displaying urgency.


"Alpha," they bowed to him. "We have company.Alpha Jaris is here."


My eyes flared wide in surprise. I wanted to believe l hadn't heard clearly, but father sprang to his feet.Shit! This was real.


We scurried outside to find Jaris and tons of his men stepping out of their cars. The two men from the restaurant were also present. My jaw dropped. Why do I have a feeling he was here to cause trouble?


"Alpha Jaris," Father stepped forward, delighted as he was shocked. "What a pleasant surprise. You should've told me you were coming. I'd have prepared a grand welcome."


Jaris' eyes found mine, and not for one second did he look away. That made me uncomfortable in a lot of ways.


"There's no need for that, Alpha Bennett. I didn't come here for a grand welcome. I came here," he stepped forward. "to hear directly from your daughter."


Nora and her mother were out of the house, although they kept their distance.


By the moon, I didn't like this one bit.


Father looked at me with furrowed brows.


Jaris explained. "Your daughter here told me she was no longer interested." His eyes took on a shadowy gleam. "I got your message."


I nervously licked my lower lip. "Iuh..."


"Can you say it again, Lyric?" He ambled toward me.


He looked far too intimidating like this.I found myself retreating.


"What makes you think you can actually reject someone like me?" I picked offense on that. Oh, so you're the only one who gets to reject people, huh?


"Lyric, what's going on?" Father turned to me.


Now, there were too many eyes on me.


Jaris finally stopped coming at me, but his expression didn't get any softer.


You can do this, Lyric.


I should stand by my words of not being interested.The problem was, it was easier saying it to his men than it was to him. Staring at that terrifyingly handsome face, I couldn't bring myself to get the words out.


He opened his palm and a gun was placed into it.Okay...what did he-


I gasped when he aimed at one of father's cars and took a shot. The window glass shattered instantly.


"Jaris! What's the meaning of this!?" Father growled.


"Forgive me, Alpha Bennett, but I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. If your daughter will not honour our agreement, then I believe everything you own now belongs to me, considering the depth of your debt."


He shot at another window.
###Chapter 13
LYRIC



Rage filled my bones. I never knew he had such an ugly side.


He was about to shoot at another window when I got in the way. "Fine! You've made your point. Everything doesn't have to be about violence." I glared daggers at him.



He looked at the broken glasses, then at me, his eyes devoid of emotion. "Believe me, there is nothing violent about this. You'll know violence when you see one."



My heart constricted with fury, so much that I wished I could pour it alI out on him. But who was I kidding?


"Do we have an understanding, then?" He asked,casually/putting his hands behind his back. "We do. Now, put the gun away."


More to my dismay, he pointed at another window.


What?? What was wrong with him?


" know daughters like you are usually ill-bred, but you must learn to speak to me with respect,considering the fact that you'll be associated with me for some time."


I scoffed, feeling insulted. I opened my mouth to retort but instantly paused when he cocked the gun.His warning was clear: say another wrong word and lose more windows.



My nails dug into my palms as I fisted my hands.How did I not see this part of him five years ago? How did he manage to be so deceptively calm and gentle?


"I understand," I couldn't keep my tone from being scathing.


His gaze lingered on me before he finally lowered his gun. He turned to father. "I hope you do not mind the little display. It was necessary to make my point clear. Don't worry, I'll take care of the repairs."


I scoffed at how arrogant he sounded, like he was doing my father a favour.


When he looked at me, I tore my gaze away, crossing my arms across my chest. "Someone will be here to fetch you tomorrow. One p.m. Be ready."


He turned away, heading to his car. Using the opportunity, I glared heavily at his back.


Ugh! What a brute!


Now, I was more concerned about having to live with him for a year. With how bad things were between us,I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't make it out alive.







As expected, father was angry over the fact that l had snubbed Jaris' request to meet with me earlier.I had to remind him that if it wasn't for the fact that l was doing this for him, I'd be long gone to my country. I didn't like it here. Not one bit.


Well, now that I was likely to sign the contract,I needed to fully end things with Roderick. I couldn't become someone else's Luna if I still had some silly bond with another.


I gave him what felt like a hundred missed calls, but he ignored all of them.


Eventually, he called me at his own time in the evening, requesting to meet in a garden he owned.


"Why aren't we just going to the temple? We could meet up there," I asked him over the phone.


"We'll go to the temple. I just need to show you something."


After a slight argument, | agreed to meet with him.


In less than an hour, I arrived and found him in the VIP section, sitting alone in the middle of the garden.

Such an ugly figure in the midst of beautiful flowers.


Of course, Roderick had good looks, but his heart was not the same.


"Thanks for coming," I wasn't used to him being so polite. "Please, take a seat."


But I didn't. "I didn't come here to sit. What is it you wanted to show me? Be fast about it so we can go to the temple."


"Can you listen to me and just sit, Lyric?"


" already told you No. Go straight to the point.Please."


Geez, it felt good to have my own will. How had I survived as the old Lyric?


"Fine." He took a deep breath. "I want us to get back together."


Alarms went off in my head. For a moment, I was numb,his words taking longer than usual to register.


"Excuse me?" | scoffed, batting my lashes. "Sweet Seraphis, please tell me you're joking."


"I have no reason to. Look, I know I was an asshole to you. I was rude,treated you with disdain... I'm sorry,Lyric, I didn't know any better. But I promise you, I'm ready to do better. If you could give me one more chance-give us one more chance-l promise it'll be the best decision of your life."


I couldn't stop staring at him. I was actually tempted to touch him just to be sure I wasn't dreaming.Because how was this happening right now!?


Roderick Fletcher is asking me to get back with me?Oh, he's got to be kidding me!


"You're not joking," I mumbled, my forehead crinkling with a frown. "You actually called me here to say this?Really?"


"Lyric-"


"We are over!" I yelled at him. "You made that very clear when you threw me out of your Pack after using me to achieve your lame desires! For over a year, l lived like a slave! You wouldn't even let me look at you because you hated the sight of my face so much.I meant nothing to you, Roderick! And now, because Lyric is different, you suddenly want me back?"


He stood up. "It's-It's not what you think. Look, l-"


"I don't wanna hear it!" I held my hand to him,halting him.



Goodness, just hearing him speak was grating on my nerves.


"We're over, Roderick. We've been over five years.Now, take me to the temple."


I started walking away but stopped when I noticed he wasn't following. By the moon, I wasn't in for this drama today.


"Roderick, what're you doing? I didn't come here for this."


His face looked strict as he shook his head. "I'm not doing this, Lyric. I'm sorry, but you'll have to get back with me. I'm not severing the last bond we have."
###Chapter 14 
My mind whirled from his words. For some time,l was totally out of words.


"Sorry, what did you just say?" My face crumpled in bemusement.


"You heard me. I'm sorry for everything that happened. But I'm ready to be a better man. You know me, I'm powerful now. can take good care of you. Everything will be better than it was."


It was more alarming how he spoke with so much confidence, like I was just supposed to run into his arms at his sweet words. Like I didn't know how devilish his heart was.


I walked back to him. "If you think I, Lyric Harper, will ever get back to you, then you're more delusional than I gave you credit for. I am done with you and never coming back. Now, let's go to the temple and end this!" By the grace of the night, I never thought I'd be the one pestering Roderick to go to the temple. The asshole had been on my neck for months, asking me to come back and finish the bond. And now, he thinks he could say trash?


"I'm sorry, then" he shrugged casually. "You'll just have to find a way to put up with me."


He took up his keys and walked past me.


No. No. No.


I ran after him, getting in front of him. "You're not doing this, Roderick. I'm done with you!"


He stopped walking and simply stared into my face.He gave me this long soft stare. "You're fucking beautiful, Lyric," he furrowed his brows. "How did |never see this?"


You were too busy seeing the ugly side of me,asshole!




Before I could react, he touched my hair, twirling some of the strands around his finger. What was wrong with him? This guy was actually about to get mated to my sister! How much of an asshole could he be?


"I'll see you soon." He continued on his way.


I ran after him, calling and yelling, but he didn't stop for one second. And when we got to his car, his guards wouldn't let me get any closer. He got in and rode off.


I brushed my fingers through my hair, utterly frustrated. This had to be a joke!


If Roderick wouldn't sever the last bond with me,then I couldn't get mated to Jaris.



MARTA







She walked into the room where her kids were fast asleep. Making sure the door was shut, she proceeded to the bed and tapped Xyla.
The little girl came awake with a slight grunt."Mummy? Is it time to get ready for school?"


"It's not." Marta withdrew a stick of cigar and lit it.


It got Xyla coughing.


"I just have a question for you." She took a drag from her stick. "Why did you snitch on me to your dad?"


Xyla's countenance dropped. She already knew where this was headed and was already scared.


"I thought I told you not to tell him? Were you so desperate to make mummy look bad before him?"


Xyla shook her head.


She took another drag from her cigar, releasing the smoke toward the little girl's direction.


"You've always being the problematic one. Why can't you be like your brother, huh? Always minding his business he hardly talks? Why can't you have some sense!?"



"I'm sorry, mummy. I was just worried about Xylon. The woman was able to treat him in..."


"Oh, shut it!" She half-yelled, startling the little girl."Do you have any idea the trouble you caused me?Do you seriously enjoy being destructive in my life?"


Xyla dug her small finger into her palms. "But Xylon and I are your children. Shouldn't you want the best for us? Hiding the nice woman's identity makes you look like a bad mom."


Marta scoffed, her eyes turning icier.


She went closer to her. "How many times have I told you to watch that tongue of yours, you spoiledlittle brat? You really have no respect, do you?"


She glanced at the burning end of her cigarette."Well, right now, I'll be reminding you of what happens when you disobey mummy. It'sbeen long.Seems you've forgotten."


Xyla panicked and crawled away, into the bed.


"No screaming, Xyla. Remember what happens when you scream." Marta taunted. The girl's eyes brimmed with tears as she awaited the burn from the cigarette.


LYRIC



I told father everything that happened with Roderick,and as expected, he was pissed and tried reaching out to him, but his calls were ignored.


In his study, he explained the dangers to me. "The reason Darkspire had rejected your sister was because they knew she was entangled with Roderick already. If they find out the same about you, I'm afraid they'd want to reject you as well, and I'd have to find a way to pay up the debt which would become a very big problem, Lyric."


I was also concerned about it.



"But Roderick is powerful now, and he was interested in Nora. Didn't he ever think of helping with the debt?" | asked when it occurred to me.


"He promised to support with half of it once he ended things with you and got mated to Nora. But now, everything's just messed up."


In the end, father told me to keep up the act with Jaris while he goes to Roderick's Pack himself to get the issue sorted out.



When it was time, a car did come to pick me up.I was a little nervous as we drove off to Darkspire.


I didn't know why, but I had a feeling that things could get really rocky for me. There was just something about Jaris that screamed danger.


We arrived at Darkspire and I was led into the large living room. I was offered a drink and some snacks and asked to wait for Jaris who was busy with some important issues.


After waiting for more than thirty minutes, I got bored with just sitting and decided to explore the room. The room was quite large with a lot of artworks.


I picked up interest in one very large frame on the wall. It was Jaris, straining an arrow, ready to shoot.The picture was quite simple, but the sight of himwas beyond hot.


The man was a beauty. My mind drifted to the first night I saw him-the goosebumps, the excitement,the thrill.


'Until tonight, I don't think I've ever met a lady as stunning as you, Princess!'


Even now, his words still send shivers down my spine.





Why did he have to leave by morning? What went wrong in what had seemed like a perfect moment?I wish I could get answers from him, but the old Lyric was a part of me l'd been trying so hard to bury.I never wanted to awaken it.


A sad smile formed on my lips as I skimmed my fingers along the portrait. A one-night experience that was still unforgettable even after so many years.


"What're you doing?"


I lowered my hand and turned around to see so meone on the stairs, gawking at me like I was committing a grave offense. My heart sank when l recognized her. The kids' mother. Jaris's possible lover.



"Over here, you don't just touch things you're not supposed to." She continued her descent down the stairs.



A couple of seconds and my head was back to normal. I glanced at the frame, then at her. "Sorry,but it's just a portrait. I don't think it was dipped in gold or there's a warning sign saying 'do not touch'."


Displeasure creased her brows.


"You're a stranger here," her voice was colder."There are rules you should stick to. You should try to listen to me when I'm talking."


I bit down my retort as I lowered my gaze. If I did go through with the Alpha's contract, Ms. hot-head and I would clearly be seeing each other more often.I didn't want to be on the wrong side with her.


I felt her hot glare on me. She started toward the door but suddenly paused, turning to me again.


"Once again, you were wrong to have gone into my kids' room without my consent. That must not happen again, whoever-you-are."


Now, what was her problem? "I know. You made that crystal clear when you asked me to leave without thanking me for helping your son. Besides, I think you know who I am already, otherwise, you wouldn't be so bitter towards me."


"Did you just say I'm bitter?"


"Isn't it obvious? You keep trying to start up an issue with me when it's unnecessary."


And honestly, I wasn't in for this. I'd rather not have someone like her to deal with.


Her eyes darkened as she started toward me. I looked at her in confusion, wondering what silly idea she had in mind.
###Chapter 15

The door suddenly opened, bringing her to a stop.


It was Jaris and his two assistants.



I noticed the lady take some steps back, especially when Jaris' eyes lingered on her.


"Is there a problem?" He slid his gaze between both of us.



I was tempted to tell him to ask his partner or whoever she was to him, but I let it slide.


"We were just having a conversation," she said, her gaze icy on me. "But we're done here."


She turned and left. I took a deep breath. Now, that is one problem out of the door.


However, the room seemed to heat up in an instant when Jaris' eyes locked on mine.
"With me." He tilted his head and took the stairs.







I followed him to what looked like an office. Although,it was quite large-bigger than an average bedroom-and well furnished.


We were the only ones in-no assistants, nobody. And for some reason, that made me uncomfortable.


"A drink?" He asked as he poured some from the side table.



"N-No. I'm fine."


He filled one glass for himself before taking a seat and urged me to mine which was in front of him.


Jaris Dreadmoor.Who would've thought?


He went through some files before taking one of them out. "Before we begin, I'd like to know how good you are with treatments."


I furrowed my brows, not quite getting him. "I'm aware you took care of my son the other day. What you did for him, it's something that usually takes us hours to achieve. And I heard it only took you minutes. Is that true?"



I nodded.



"How were you able to do it? Did you study this field in particular?"


I hesitated on that. The truth was, I'd only studied medicine for a year during the time I was away.lt wasn't enough time for anyone to get full knowledge,but from a young age, I'd always had a passion for it.And when I encountered someone who started putting me through it, I discovered it was relatively easy for me. I could easily identify problems, know their immediate solutions, and it was always more effective when I did it myself.


My tutor was also surprised, but in the end, I got to understand that I'd inherited the distinctive healing skills from my grandmother.


It was a rare gift that ran in the family. My mother and her siblings didn't get it. None of my cousins had gotten it either. I found it strange that out of everyone, I turned out to be the lucky one.


I'd been trying to keep this hidden as my kind was always in high demand. If people get to know, I'd become more of a tool, and I didn't want that.


"... actually have some knowledge in medicine," |answered after a slight hesitation. "Let's just say it's a gift from the moon."



His brows furrowed for a second before he straightened his face.


"Okay. But, do you think you can completely heal my boy? He's been sick with Nexopathy since he was two. I've done all I could to get him the best doctor.DDo you think you'll be able to help?"


I should say No. But thinking about the state the little boy had been in the other day made my heart hurt for him. He didn't deserve to go through that.


"His case seems to be a little rare," | supplied. "But...with the right examination and research, I think l should be able to get to something good."


"And how long do you think that'll take?"


There was desperation in his eyes. Wow. Jaris Dreadmoor was desperate. I felt my heart warm. He did love his kids.


"I honestly don't know. Might take weeks or months."


His case was actually a serious one. If the epistles persist, he might not recover from one of them.


Jaris took a deep breath as he stared down at his table. When he looked at me again, his expression was taut, like the stoic Alpha I knew.


"These are the terms of our agreement," he slid the file to me. "Take your time to study it and let me know if there are any concerns. But I want it signed before you leave.


"Also, I'm offering you a blank cheque in return for treating my son. If you're able to do it, to heal him completely," he chuckled, "you'll be free to ask for anything in the world." I met his gaze and there was a clash as our eyes locked.Wow. What a tempting offer.


"Thank you. I'll do my best."


I was about to open the file to gothrough it when the door opened behind me.


"Daddy!"


My heart leapt as I turned around for a look. The two kids ran into the office, into the arms of Jaris.They were dressed in uniforms, indicating they'd just returned from school.


I watched with a smile as Jaris fondly touched them,asking how their day was and all. He might be arrogant and a brute when he wanted to, but he sure knew how to handle his kids.


For a moment there, I felt sad as my mind drifted to a dark painful corner. What if my kids had made it alive? Would Jaris have been happy to meet them?Would he have loved them just like he did Xylon and Xyla? Probably not. He already had a family he loved dearly. I was sure I'd have only been intruding.


It wasn't until the kids were done with him that they finally noticed me.


"It's the nice aunty!" Xyla spoke first, running to me."Hi! I was hoping I'd see you again."


Goodness, why did I feel so much joy each time l spoke with her? I loved it.


The boy came to me next. "Thank you," he muttered the words slowly.


I noticed he rarely spoke. Xyla did most of the talking when they were talking with their father.


"You're welcome, handsome. How are you feeling today?" It was taking me a lot of effort to hold back from touching his perfect curly hair.


"I'm fine. Just have a little joint pain here..." he pointed at his shoulder.


Xyla and Jaris looked surprised, as though they were not used to seeing the little boy communicate freely with strangers.


"Okay. Let's take a look at that." Taking the shoulder,I gave it a little squeeze, then held it for some time.


He made an "ouch."


"Xylon, are you okay?" His sister asked.


He rolled his shoulder and seemed surprised. "It feels very fine. I can't feel a thing! Thank you!"


To my surprise, he took my hand, giving it a little squeeze. That simple gesture melted me more than I thought was possible.


Goodness, why did it feel so good?


I looked up at Jaris and he was staring back at me,and this time, there was amusement in his eyes.
###Chapter 16
LYRIC


I went through the contract multiple times. What was required of me was quite simple-represent Darkspire as their Luna for one year, accompany Jaris to important events and functions, be loyal to the Pack,and treat his son.


In return, I was guaranteed protection, unlimited access to the properties of the Pack, and mny father's debt being cleared.


Everything seemed normal. And that was the point; I still didn't know what Darkspire was getting out of this.


I'd tried to ask Jaris about it, but he told me they were gaining nothing. And well, I couldn't force a different answer out of him.


But at the end of the day, I signed the contract. LunaIsolde was pleased and informed me that the coronation ceremony would be held in three days.


For a moment, I was thrilled. I, Lyric,the girl who was constantly bullied and rejected, was going to be the Luna of the most powerful Pack.


"It's only for a year. You'll still get rejected," my bitter subconsciousness told me.


Hopefully, I'd get to uncover the truth during my stay here.



My father was beyond pleased when I returned to the estate and told him the contract had been signed.But I became worried when he told me he'd been unable to reach Roderick.


"Father, the ceremony's only in three days!"|exclaimed. "I cannot go through with it if I amstill being bonded to Roderick. Alpha Jaris' night actually gets mad if he learns of this."


"I know. I know. But we can't tell them yet." Lines of worry creased his forehead. "Things are finally happening the right way, Lyric. Don't worry, I'll handle Roderick."


I fisted my hands. That son of a bitch. What exactly was he playing at?


Father convinced me to ignore him and start gathering my things. In three days, I'd be moving to Darkspire.






The next morning, Jace and I met up. He told me he had an errand to run and needed my company.


Well, it wasn't new. When Jace and I were kids, we went everywhere together.


I remembered one time, he had beaten a guy to a pulp for calling me a monster. Ugh, the good old days.


"I still didn't understand why you're making me drive," I sounded grumpy as I took a turn.


Jace was seated beside me, munching on a can of chips. "Stop whining, Ly. You should be grateful I'm letting you drive my Thundra V8. It's the latest baby in the market."


"Well, considering the fact that you almost rammed into me two days ago, I'd say you're scared and want to take some driving lessons from me."


"Excuse you? That was intentional. Believe me,honey, I wouldn't risk my V8 for your skin."


I broke a laugh.


Seizing the opportunity, I told him about Jaris and me. His reaction was well expected, shocked, and dramatic.


"So, you're telling me two days from now, you'll be Luna of Darkspire?" I shrugged.


"Well, it's amazing news, and I'd have loved to say congratulations, but why does it have to be for a year? A Pack needs a Luna that would last for a lifetime. So, why the hell is Darkspire making it look like they're heading somewhere or something?"
"Wish I knew," I shrugged. And to be honest, it was the biggest problem I had. How was I sure I wasn't walking into some sort of trap?


"Well, it's delightful 'cause you'll finally be in power.At least, I have someone to kick asses for me. Not like I've ever needed your lazy help, though." He winked at mne.


"Jace! What the hell? I've never been lazy!"


"Oh, yeah. Well remember that one time you were so strong you cried when that mean girl-what was her name again-Michelle, said awful words to you?I mean, all you had to do was talk back at her, Lyric.But you just stood there, crying your eyes out until l came to rescue you."


I rolled my eyes."We were just nine years old."


Michelle had been the daughter of an Alpha of a neighboring Pack. She was everything I was not-beautiful, smart, well-loved and admired by everyone. Back then, I didn't know how to talk back at people like her. But yeah, she had been a really mean bitch.


"Michelle was just nine as well, yet she made you cry.Just saying," Jace added with a shrug.


We finally reached his destination and he stepped out of the car,leaving me alone.


I watched him run into the tall, skyscraper building.


The Central Hospital.


It was the largest hospital in the country, filled with only the best doctors. People flew in from every corner of the world to get treated here because, well,if you couldn't find a solution in TCH, there was a very good chance that your ailment didn't have a cure.


I sucked in a deep breath, mesmerized by the sheer beauty of the place.


When I was younger, I'd come here at least, thrice a week, just stand out here and stare at the building.I'd watch people go in and out, some would come out happy, others would come out sad. I used to wonder if I could ever have a chance to work there. But only the strongest doctors were allowed there, and I didn't even have a wolf. They'd definitely kick me out if I were interviewed.


I placed my head on the steering wheel, trying to pull my attention to somewhere more convenient.


Minutes passed, and I figured Jace was running late.I looked at the hospital again, and this time,my heart sank into the very pit of my stomach. The sight before me shattered me completely, making it almost impossible for me to breathe.
###Chapter 17 
LYRIC


My hand tightened around the steering as my throat became as dry as dust.


What was he doing here? With her?


Coming out of the hospital were Jaris and Marta.They were having a conversation and right there,they looked like a normal couple.


I shouldn't feel this way, considering the fact that the woman had kids for him, but it served as a constant reminder that he had someone in his life already.


His beta-Kael came out shortly, holding Xylon and Xyla's hands. It became clear that they must've brought Xylon in for a checkup or something.


My heart sank even further. The kids were so adorable, but at that moment, I couldn't help not seethem all as one happy family. It was also a reminder of Jaris' betrayal five years ago. He made me think I was special when he had a pregnant lover at home.


Suddenly, a thought occurred to me. What if Marta was occupied with something and couldn't be Jaris'Luna right now? That would explain why they only needed me for a year. With me gone, Marta would take over.


Was that what I was? A mere replacement?


The thought stung. Even after becoming so pretty,I was still being used, wasn'tl?


As I watched them get into the backseat of their car,I was angry enough to shed a tear.


JARIS


"See? He looks fine today. I am telling you, Jaris,there's no need for that woman to come near my kids," Marta said as soon as we were in the car.


I touched the back of my nape, exhausted already."Please, Marta, don't be so daft. We've known Xylon well enough to know it's only temporary. He might have another crisis today. What're you going to do about that?"

"And I will take care of him like I've been doing for the past three years. I'm one of the head doctors in TCH,Jaris.I can do this!"


"Yet, your best has not exactly helped him in three years."


Marta's jaw dropped.


"I really can't understand why you have anissue with this. You should be glad we've finally found someone that can help Xylon."


"She won't be able to," Marta's eyes glistened with under tears. "If I can't do it, believe me when I say nobody else can. I have tried my best, Jaris."


"Yet, she was able to do something you haven't been able to do in years in mere minutes. Do you see the difference now?"


"It's possible there was something fishy about what she did that day.I'm-"


"Marta, if you're gonna keep talking about this, then I'd suggest you get out of the car."


Now, that was enough to shut her up, but she looked like she was going to cry any minute. Unfortunately,that was her problem, not mine.


****+****+



I had so much planned on what to do once I got to the Pack. But one of them was not getting a visit from some representatives from the Alpha King's palace,bearing news.


The throne of the Alpha King ruled over every other.One did not get visits from representatives unless the matter was dire.



They were waiting in the conference room with the elders of my Pack, and Nerion informed me as soon as I arrived.


"I couldn't get you on the phone. So, I decided to wait for your return. They've been waiting patiently,"
he supplied as he led me to the conference room.


"Did they say anything about why they're here?"I asked.


"They wouldn't. Whatever they came with seems to be confidential, and they only want it delivered to you."


I hated being curious. The Alpha King-King Thaddeus-and I have been on very good terms. Just a week ago, we were on a phone call for half an hour.There was no way he'd bring trouble to my Pack.


We finally reached the conference hall and the men who had been sitting rose to their feet.


"Alpha Jaris," One of them called. The rest acknowledged with a nod.


Their faces were not looking good at all. Something was terribly wrong.
###Chapter 18 
JARIS


I forced my composure as I walked past them to my seat at the head of the table.


I called each of their names, acknowledging them."I apologize if you had to wait for long. I had no idea you were coming.Please, take your seats."


They did so.


I noticed there was no water or refreshment on the table.



I turned to Nerion who was standing beside me."Why weren't they offered anything?"


"We objected," one of the representatives replied."What we came to do is too bleak to drink."


 
I furrowed my brows. What did they come to do? "And what might that be, if you do not mind me asking? Is there a problem?"


Another nodded. "A very big one, Alpha Jaris."


There was a long pause, and they exchanged stares,then they added with a painful expression. "The Alpha King is dead."







The news came like a punch to the gut. It took longer than necessary to digest it and understand what they meant.


The Alpha King. As in, King Thaddeus was dead?



No.


"How did this happen?" My face crumpled with a frown. "We spoke just a week ago. He wvas fine!Someone like Thaddeus doesn't randomly succumb to death. He was a strong man!" And he wasn't even that old. Only ninety-seven.


Damn it. I was losing my control. It was snapping out of me.


"We're as shocked as you are," another said,his head lowered as he spoke. "Just yesterday, he was very fine and didn't have any issues. He even entertained a visit from Alpha Greg and played golf with him. He was in good health. We were all surprised when we found him dead this morning,in his bed."



"He died in his sleep?"


"He did. To our ultimate shock. As we speak, more representatives are flying to other Packs to deliver the news."


This was nonsense. How was this possible?


"Have you tried to ascertain the cause of his death?"I asked.


"Not yet. But the doctors think it might be poison.They're yet to ascertain what kind of poison."


"And if it was truly poison," another representative added. I shifted my gaze to him. "You think it might not have been poison?"


"Well," he shrugged. "Alpha Kings usually have the fortification to withstand certain kinds of poisons.The King isn't supposed to die by mere poisoning."


I nodded. It made sense. "How about the people responsible for his food and drink?"


"They've already been locked up and are currently being punished and interrogated. But so far, they're all swearing their innocence."


Something didn't feel right. If King Thaddeus had been murdered, it only meant there was a huge issue on the ground. And if we didn't find out what it was,it might be too late by the timne we do.


The representatives and I deliberated more on the issue for some time before they said something else.


"Right now, we have a more pressing issue. The Central Throne is empty, and judging from history, it isn't advisable to leave it vacant for long. We need a new King as soon as possible."


That had occurred to me the moment they delivered the news of the King's death. Someone needed to take his place.


"We know how it's done. The top ten ranking Alphas have the right to participate in the process."


But the final decision lies with the elders and representatives of the central pack. They'd be the ones to take a vote based on the strongest and most productive Alpha.


Usually, the current Alpha King could play a huge role in recommending someone before his passing. But since King Thaddeus suddenly passed away before he could give his recommendations, the whole decision would have to lie with the elders.


I was pretty sure a lot of Alphas would be bloodthirsty for this.


"We just want you to know that King Thaddeus spoke very highly of you," one of the eIders said. "And we also see what you've been doing. Don't think we have an interest in anyone else."


My face gave nothing; no impression whatsoever. "I appreciate your belief in me, but we'll still have to go through the normal process, you know that."


"We do. We're just letting you know that you're a good recommendation."


I shrugged. The truth was, a part of me had seen this coming. King Thaddeus and I had a good relationship, and well, I was currently the highest-ranking Alpha. I'd always suspected the throne might be left to me someday.


We discussed other things, like funeral arrangements and how to break the news to the public.


A while later, they left.


For the rest of my day, my mood was completely ruined.


I stayed in my office, flipping through reports Thaddeus and I had shared, hoping to find something suspicious. I didn't know why I felt a conspiracy concerning his death. Someone killed him. But for what reason exactly?


Something didn't feel right.


By evening, my mother came in to grumble about how it was late and I hadn't had anything to eat yet.I sent her away, still too angry.


But a while later, Kael arrived with an information.


"Sorry for bothering you, but I think you might want to see this." He held out his phone to me.


A video was playing on it, and as soon as I realized the person in the video, my anger amplified.


What the fuck.



"Is that Lyric!?"Isnarled.


He nodded as he withdrew the phone from my face.


Rage filled my chest. I squeezed the pen in my hand so hard it snapped.
What in the name of Hades was this?


I stood up. "Get the car ready. Quickly."
###Chapter 19
LYRIC


"You know, for someone who's about to become the Luna of the Almighty Darkspire, I don't think this is a great idea," Jace said as I downed my sixth shot.


"Oh, please!" I rolled my eyes. "Don't act like you're not enjoying this."


He laughed,confirming my suspicion.


I smiled as I returned to the top stage,taking up the mic, singing and dancing the stupid dance steps l could come up with in my head.


They were funny, I knew. All I knew how to do best was sway my hips.


Another man came up to hold me around my waist


Nope. I was done with this.
"Just dance alone now, will ya? I'm done dancing with others."I winked at him.


He looked displeased but left.


I sang and laughed happily for a long time. Ooh! The people seemed to really like me.


I descended the stage to take more shots.


"You sing beautifully," a young fine man said when l took the last step down the stage.


I flashed a smile at him. "Thank you, gentleman."


"And you're really beautiful." He added.


Another smile. "I know. Thank you."


Suddenly, he held my hand. "Would you mind dancing with me?"


Ugh. It felt like I'd danced with almost everyone already. "Sorry, you should've come earlier."


I freed my hand and returned to Jace.


"Lyric, do you know who that is?" He looked amused.
I glanced back at the man to see him walking back to a booth.


"No. I can't know everyone, Jace."


"Okay. Well, look to your right."


I did, and the face I saw made me want to puke.


Michelle.



The little bullying bitch.


What the hell? She was here?


Well, she wasn't just here, she was also glaring at me like I had taken her candies.



"While you were up there, displaying your awful vocal skills, she came in with him. And I do not need a soothsayer to tell me they share a thing. Apparently,the young man seems to share that very thing with others."



I looked back at the man who had joined a couple of boys.Oh... "Well, first of all, I don't have terrible vocal skills.Have you seen how people clamour when I'm up there? Secondly, looks like Michelle is still very lucky with getting the good guys."


And back then, she always made it clear to me that l could never get the good guys.


"Not to make you sad, honey, but I think the words the people were clamoring were 'get down from that stage.' And to answer your question about Michelle's boyfriend, just asked you for a dance, and you turned him down. Don't you feel like making someone a little jealous?"


The idea sounded funny to me. I was almost dismissing it when I looked at Michelle again and had second thoughts. She used to be a real bitch back then, and now, I could get a little bit of revenge on her.


"You're a genius, Jace. Anyone ever told you that?" I giggled and left.


I walked up to the fine man who seemed surprised to see me. And at such perfect timing, Michelle was just coming around.


"Hi! Still want that dance?" I kept my eyes on the man's and didn't evenlook her way.


"He doesn't. Why don't you go pick someone else?"The bully said, irritation in her voice.


I turned to her with a smile.


Well, well, well. I might dislike her, but I couldn't deny the fact that she had grown into a very beautiful woman. Michelle had always been beautiful, and back then, a part of me had been intimidated.


"Hi, Michelle." I waved at her. Surprise crumpled her face.



Yes, I know you,witch.


"Sorry, but your boyfriend asked me for a dance.You're not the restricting type, are you?"


The man was already on his feet, holding out his hand. "Please, dance with me." Grinning with happiness, I took his hand. To Michelle,I winked. "I'm Lyric, by the way. The name should sound familiar."


I watched her jaw drop while I proceeded to the dance floor with her date.


Hm. Sure feels good to be beautiful.


He had his hand around my waist and we danced into forgetfulness.


I was finally pressed and needed to use the restroom.But I didn't leave without taking one more shot at the counter. When I got there, Jace wvas surprisingly gone.


Hm. Maybe he had to take a call or something.


I proceeded to the restroom and was about to go in when I noticed I was being followed. Turning around,I found two men in front of me. One was Michelle's boyfriend. He said his name was Josh.


The other, I did not recognize. "Hey, this is for the ladies," I gave them disapproving looks.


"Yeah, we know. My friend just wants to talk to you."The strange guy said, tipping his head toward Josh.


"O...kay. Well, just in case this is new to you,most people aren't comfortable having conversations in restrooms. People like me, mostly. So, why don't you step out and we could talk when I'm-"


"No. I think here's just better," Josh cut me off,coming toward me.


I looked at them, beady-eyed. What did they think they were doing?


It suddenly dawned on me. We were in a restroom,alone, in a noisy bar.


"Josh... step back," I warned while retreating.


He suddenly laughed. "Please, I hope you don't think I'm here to do anything stupid. Believe me, I'll never force myself on a woman. I'm just here to talk." Well, that did nothing to calm me. "Like I said, we could talk outside."


He took a step forward.


"Stop!"


"Okay, okay. Fine." He held up hishands in surrender."You got it, I'll just wait outside. It's just that, what I have to say is really important. And I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable."


He cocked his head at his friend. "Come on, Matt.Let's go."


I still took a step back, but there was a little bit of water on the floor, and the slippery thing tripped me.


I screamed as I lost balance, my body going toward the floor. Josh came to me in one swift move,putting his arms around me, steadying me.


At the same time, Matt had already opened the door,and before him was a face he didn't recognize.


"Who are-" Before he could finish the question, his heart was ripped out of his chest.


My eyes opened wide in horror as I looked at the face of the man who now came into view when Matt dropped dead on the floor.


Standing there at the doorframe, with a pulsing heart in his hand was Jaris.
###Chapter 20
LYRIC


"What the hell!?" Josh flinched, stepping away from me immediately.


I had nearly lost my balance again due to his arms suddenly leaving me.


My heart had sunk deep into the pit of my stomach as I prayed for the sight before me to be a dream.But it wasn't. Josh's friend was dead. Killed by Jaris.


His eyes, like dark pools, were on me. Then, slowly,they shifted to Josh, and he emitted a certain monstrous snarl. He tossed the heart to the floor and started approaching Josh and me.


No. Not me. Josh.


"I-I haven't done anything!" Josh cried.


Realizing what was happening, I ran to stand before Josh.


"What do you think you're doing!? What do you have against him?" I snapped at the man who looked insane right now.


"Step out of the way, Lyric." His eyes were still on Josh behind me.


"Why!? What did he do?"


Finally, he looked at me. And if I wasn't so angry myself, I'd have crumpled to my knees in fear.


"Do I really have to spell it out? I need to explain why I want to kill a man who had his hands over you?"


It dawned on me like a bell. My eyes widened like saucers at the realization.


No, wait. He just killed Matt because he thought they were harassing me!?


Please, don't tell me.


He tried to walk past me, but I moved, getting in his way."What is wrong with you? Alpha!?" I added the last name maliciously. "Did you just kill him because we were together!?"


To my dismay, he gripped my wrist with his bloodstained hand. The very one that had held Matt's heart. I wanted to puke.


"I am trying so hard not to pour my frustration out on you. Now, get out of my way, Lyric Harper, before I do something I will regret."


I glanced back at Josh, and he was scared to death.This only worked to infuriate me some more.


"We are leaving. Now." I gritted.


"Like hell we are." He tossed me aside.


But before he could get to Josh, I was in front of him again. "Please! He didn't do anything! I promise,he was just about leaving."


"Why the hell didn't you tell me you were connected to Alpha Jaris!?" Josh yelled behind me.


Because I'm not-l wanted to tell him, but Jaris was already blind-furious, and the last thing I wanted to do was grate on his nerves some more.


"You're not touching him. Otherwise, you can kiss goodbye to your son's treatment." My eyes were dead serious as I looked into his. And right there,I saw his rage grow.


Josh took his chances. Carefully, and I mean, very carefully, he scurried out the door. To my greatest relief, Jaris let him. But his eyes didn't get any softer.


Now that Josh was safe, my anger was in full flow,especially as I stared at Matt on the floor.


He was dead.



Dead. Because of him.


My gaze turned icier as I walked past him, heading for the door. But a strong hand grabbed my wrist,twirling me around to face him.



"Did you just threaten me?" His voice was as icy as the bite of a frigid breeze against exposed skin. "I did! Because you were about to kill an innocent man!"


His hand around my wrist turned painful, making me wince. My forehead crinkled as I looked at him, but there was still no mercy in his eyes.


"I do not take kindly to threats, Lyric Harper. Threats signify danger, and I am known to always eliminate dangers."


"Let me go," my eyes turned glassy from how hard he held me.



"For your sake, I'd advise you never interrupt me in this way,ever again."


"Well, take a look at the floor!" I tipped my head toward Matt. "He didn't deserve that. You don't just kill people because you're upset!"


"Upset?" He looked at me like I was the unreasonable one. "First, you come to a club wearing a revealing dress, get drunk, sing, and let some random guys grope you. You think I don't have a right 
to be upset?"


"Excuse me?" I glanced down at my dress.


Okay, I was putting on some shorts which revealed my legs, but how was it his fucking business? I've been dressing like this for years now.


"We're not mated yet!" I huffed. "I don't understand how you can make judgments over my dress!"


He finally released my hurting wrist, but I didn't try to walk away. We weren't done here.


"Besides, this is a club! Am I expected to wear a dinner dress? There are people wearing worse things than me!"



"And the boys groping you? Or do you enjoy being touched inappropriately by them?"


My lips dropped open in shock. No, he didn't just insinuate that.



"We were only dancing!" My voice was louder now,filled with hurt. "I don't get what your problem is. You can't control me this way!"


"Listen to me," His voice dipped. "I honestly do not give a fuck about how loose and wayward you are.I know your kind is bound to be this way, but in a few days, you'll be announced as mine. You'll have to represent Darkspire, and I can't have someone who doesn't know how to be comported be my Luna.You need to know your place, lady, and not bring shame to my name. Do you understand?"


My eyes glistened with tears which finally dropped to my cheeks. I balled my hands into fists, so hard my nails bit into my palms.


Did he just call me loose? Wayward? Funny how he was the one who took my virginity. The only man I'd actually ever slept with.


He looked at my face as I cried, yet there was no reason in his. Just bleak monstrosity.


Where was the man that had bedded me five years ago? Told me I was beautiful and made me feel loved when I thought the world wNas against me? How did I ever fall for him?


He stormed out of the restroom, leaving me alone with my tears.


I ran after him, catching up with him when he was close to his car. His beta already had his door opened for him.


"I can't do this!" I shouted, bringing him to a stop.


He looked at me, his eyes as intimidating as always.But I didn't cower.


"I'm sorry, I thought I could pull through with this,but it's become obvious we can't work out. I'm terminating the contract."
###Chapter 21
"You're terminating the contract." He repeated. It wasn't a question.


I felt bad for dad, but now, he'd really have to find a way to pay off his debts. This man just ripped out a man's heart without blinking. I couldn't be with someone like him.



A dark cruel smile played on his lips.


"You have a copy of the contract with you. Go home and read it. When you're done, get back to me for the termination."He turned toward his car.


What was he talking about? "I already read the contract before signing it."


"I told you to read carefully." His eyes held mischief as they fell on me again.


Oh, saviors. What was he on about? He stepped into his already opened car, leaving me stranded there by the road.






I didn't see Jace at the club anymore, and when l tried to call him, his lines were unreachable.


I couldn't wait for him as I had a more pressing matter.


I hurried home, found the contract and took my time to go through the termination clauses. A shiver slithered down my spine when I found the one line l had missed. I could not terminate the contract. Only Jaris had the power to do so, when he sees fit.


All I could do was abandon the contract, which was a great violation that could lead to me being locked up.


He tricked me. I may have been careless and missed it, but he tricked me! Because why was he the only one with the power to end the contract?


I couldn't breath properly. This only meant that I was stuck with Jaris. For a whole year! How was I even sure I'd make it out alive?






Three days had passed since Jaris and I last saw.Two days ago, news of the Alpha King's death circulated like wildfire.


King Thaddeus had been a fierce but nice ruler. The news of his demise was a hard pill to swallow.


Every other activity was put on hold as a result of his upcoming funeral. The mating ceremony between Jaris and I also had to be shifted to a week time, and to be honest, it was the best news I'd heard in a while. If it could, I'd want it to be shifted to a year!


Today had been fixed to be the King's funeral. Only the families of Alphas could attend-it was only a measure to control the crowd since there would be a lot of important people in attendance.


I didn't want to go, but father insisted. And well,l figured it wouldn't be a bad time to get some fresh air. I was trying to source for what to wear when a call came in from a strange number.


"Hello?"


"Ms. Harper. Good morning. It's Kael."


Kael. Jaris' beta.


I became more at alert. "Hi, good morning."


"I'm calling on behalf of Alpha Jaris to inform you that a car would be there to pick you by two p.m.Alpha Jaris would love you two to journey to Brystara together."


Brystara. That was the home of the Alpha King.


Okay,he had to be joking.


"Thanks, but I don't wanna go with him."


There was a slight pause. "I'm afraid it isn't up for debate, Ms. Harper. He wants you to get ready before the car arrives."


The call went dead on me. Seriously!? I glared at the screen like I could send a punch to Jaris through it. Well, there was no part of the contract that said I was obligated to go everywhere with him.


I went back to the task at hand, searching for something to wear.






An hour later, I was fully ready to go.I didn't want to be tb last person they had to wait for.


Like always, I reached for the scan, feeling a crushing relief as I stared at the image. A sad smile touched my lips as I ran my fingers along the edges and surface. I never got to touch them, but I missed them so much.


Satisfied, I hid the picture and left the room. But right at my doorstep was Nora, her hands crossed, her eyes glaring at me.


"What did you do to Roderick?" She asked.


Goodness. "Why wouldn't he break up with you? Why wouldn't he see me anymore?"


I rolled my eyes. "Please, Nora. We're running late."


I tried to leave, but she stood in my way. "I'm talking to you!"


"Well, I don't know. Maybe it's because I look really beautiful now."


"Oh, please! Do you think you're more beautiful than lam?"


"I don't know. Why don't you ask your supposed boyfriend or fiance why wouldn't he leave me alone?"I forced my way away from her. "And please, Nora,tell Roderick to end things with me. I'm begging now."







Father was pleased to see me downstairs.


"You look lovely,my dear."


I managed a smile. "Thanks, father." 
My stepmother was already prepared and gawked at us. Father led me outside to where our cars were waiting.


Surprisingly, or maybe not too surprisingly, there was an extra one out there.


The driver was beside it but approached me when l stepped out of the house.


"Good day, ma'am. I was sent to pick you up." He said with a bow.


The sight of it only pissed me off. Jaris was a control freak!



"I already told him I won't be going with him," I replied to the man.


Father looked at me with surprise."Lyric..."


"Let's just go. Please." I walked ahead of him, going into our own car.



I was yet to get over what he did to Matt. He killed that innocent boy for nothing and didn't even feel a single remorse.


I was determined to be away from him as much as possible, until the mating ceremony inevitably brings us together.
SOMEWHERE IN MYSTOPIA







The bartender refilled the woman's cup for the umpteenth time.


He watched as she emptied it in seconds, her eyes fixed on the screen ahead.


The bartender couldn't tell if she was interested in the sport being aired on the TV. She didn't strike him like the type that would be interested in such programmes.


She looked fierce, with a deep scar running down the left side of her cheek.


The young woman, though pretty, had the looks of someone that cared little for people.


The game finally came to an end, and she requested for her bill.


"Boring game, huh?" The bartender tsked as he waited for her to bring out her cash. "You should've asked me to switch to something more entertaining."


The woman only glanced at him-slowly-but didn't say a word. She handed his money to him.


"Gracias." The bartender said as he took her glass and turned to leave.


"I am looking for someone," the woman finally spoke,drawing his attention.


He turned around to see a picture now on the table.



"Have you seen her?"


The bartender shook his head at once. It was a lady with an ugly scar. He hadn't met anyone like that.


"Sorry I can't help you." Saying nothing, the woman tucked the picture back into her pocket.


"Who's she?" The bartender was curious.


The woman was already on her feet, dragging her weapon sheath. "She's someone that shouldn't live amongst us. Someone dangerous."
###Chapter 22
JARIS



Dominance.


My wholelife, I'd always craved for this.


My family had a history of producing the highest ranking Alphas. So, it was easy to grow up feeling in control.


But from young, I'd always craved to be the dominant one in every way. It is the reason I was doing better than my predecessors.


Yet, for the first time in my life, there happened to be someone who seemed to challenge me. Someone who grated on my nerves and tempted me to draw blood.



This was not who I am. I was always feared and respected. So,how dare she?
I left for the funeral in an irritable mood. Oh, this was not over. Lyric Harper would pay dearly for what she did today. I'd make share of that.


We took my private jet to Blystara, and the funeral was nothing short of what I had expected. Luxury.High dignitaries.


King Thaddeus may have died an early death, but it was known in our tradition to give funerals of high ranking Alphas the best.


I noticed the room go a degree colder the second I walked in with Kael and Nerion. The people paused for a moment, their beady eyes watching me as l made my way in. It was nothing new. I usually had this effect on people. It was easy with the kind of rumours that had been brewed against me.


"Jaris Dreadmoor," someone called, coming toward me.




It was Clark, the late King's brother.


He wore a bright smile as he dipped his head slightly. Well, Clark might have been a brother to the King,but he always respected me.


"Clark." I acknowledged with a nod.


"It's a pleasure to have you here."


Minutes later, the mood in the room returned to normal. Everyone was back to having their normai chatters and laughters.


Other Alphas soon joined Clark and 1. I noticed tonight, they were trying hard tobe friendlier.


It dawned on me that a lot of them had expectations of me becoming the future Alpha King. Hence,everyone suddenly wanted to get in my good books.Formerly, all they did was avoid me. But now, they wanted to be close to me. How ironic.


Some of the Alphas and I discussed the circumstance surrounding the Alpha King's death and howhi tragic it was to lose a man like him so soon. Although, they did more of the talking while I kind of listened.Suddenly, the room went cold again. But this time, it wasn't because someone terrifying had entered.I could tell from the stunned look at the people's faces as they stared at the door.


I equally turned, and for a moment, there was a tightening in my chest.


Coming through the door, next to Alpha Bennett was his daughter, my future Luna. And if she wasn't the most stunning sight I'd ever seen.


My fingers tightened around the glass of wine I held,my jaw clenching. She looked gorgeous, her long black dress, filled with silver stones at the cleavage hugged her curve so perfectly she looked like and hourglass. Her hair was styled into a messy bun,some strands falling over close to her big round green eyes.


Lyric Harper was the most good looking lady I'd ever seen-I knew that from the very first day I set eyes on her. Yet, she's the first woman to challenge me. 1loved women with fire, but I hated how she directed hers at me."Well, that is one gorgeous sight," The Alpha beside me said,dreamily.


It got on my nerves. But I couldn't blame them all for admiring her. No woman in the room had looked that good until now.


She didn't look in my direction to notice me and stayed close to her father. It took the room a while longer to get over the scene and resume their normal conversations, although a lot of them still stole glances at her from time to time.


"You might break that glass," Nerion whispered in my ear from behind.


It wasn't until that moment that I realized I had been grabbing the glass too tight. I wrinkled my nose in irritation as I dropped it on the tray of a passing waiter and tried to take my mind off the stubborn woman.


I still couldn't believe she was mad at me for saving her back at the club. I'd seen the boys following her to the restroom, heard her scream and as soon as the door went open, the asshole had his hand around her waist. Could she be any less grateful? Wasn't it obvious they were planning on hurting her? Or did she enjoy being around so much men?


Her father was taking her around, introducing her to some of the top Alphas. Now what was his problem?Why was he acting like she needed some stupid connections when she already had me? I was the highest connection she could get; the top tree that connected to other branches. Alpha Bennett really needs to stop getting on my nerves.


Not long after, they got to our spots. Of course, I'd been standing with three top Alphas. The man would want to introduce his daughter to them.


Was he aware that I hated sharing my women? It was a harmless introduction but not one I welcomed.


I noticed her go nervous as soon as they stopped before us. Her eyes only caught onto mine for two seconds before she was forced to look away. But not me.I kept my eyes on her, right on her face. Her father exchanged greetings with the Alphas.He greeted me as well, but all I did was nod.


Then, he introduced Lyric to them as his daughter.


"Seriously, Bennett. I had no idea you had such beauty in your family," one said.


"She looks like she'd make a perfect wife for my son."




Every nerve in my body tensed. If I had been holding a glass at this point, I was sure I'd have crumpled it to pieces.

###Chapter 23
JARIS


I noticed Lyric go tense as well. She darted her eyes quickly to meet mine before returning it to the floor.


I could easily read her. She might be trying to be brave all the time, but Lyric was someone that had been accustomed to fear her whole life. This fire she was always spitting was her forcing herself to be strong and not easily intimidated. She was trying so hard to be a different person.



And now, it left me curious. Who was Lyric Harper before now?


"Uh...I am sure your son is lovely, Alpha Maxwell,but my daughter is already taken," Alpha Bennett answered, surprising the others.


"Wow. Are you serious? Who is this lucky man?"

Alpha Bennett looked at me, but my mood was long ruined that I didn't want any further introduction.


"If you'd excuse me," I gave a curt nod to the other Alphas and walked away, knowing I was leaving an embarrassed lady behind.







LYRIC


My whole life, I'd never met anyone more rude. More arrogant.


How could he walk out on father and l? Was he ashamed of having me introduced as his soon to be Luna? Yet, he had stormed into the club and ripped out a man's heart for my sake.


Embarrassment coloured my cheeks as father and l continued our walk. But soon, he got too involved in a conversation with some Alphas that I didn't have any interest in.


I had to find my way around to avoid being bored. I made it to the wine counter to ask for something light. While I was waiting formy order, I felt a light tap on my shoulder and turned around to see Jace. My mood brightened up at once.


"Goodness! Forgive me, pretty lady, I must have tapped the wrong lady. I'm looking for Lyric, and you sure look a lot like her." He said with his hand on his chest.


I laughed as he hit him on the shoulder. "Stop joking around, Jace. I'm glad you made it."


"Well, you know who my father is," he shrugged."I had to be here."


Jace and I had actually planned on coming together,but something came up that had him delayed.


"So, how's it? Have you seen him around?" He asked,darting his eyes around.


I didn't need to ask who he was referring to.


"Unfortunately, I did. He walked out on father and l."I don't care what it looked like. To me, he was disrespectful by doing that. Well, he was at the top and probably felt untouchable.


"Oh, girlfriend. I hate to be the one to break this news to you, but I think you've got yourself entangled in a bit of a problem. That guy is the most dominating Alpha I know. He clearly loves control,and you're in for a scary ride." My drink was served,and I glared at Jace when he took it up instead of me.


He ignored me and sipped from it. "Well, fortunately for you, it is just for a year, right? Just three hundred and sixty five days. Eight thousand, seven hundred and sixty hours."


"Jace!" I gasped, hitting him on the arm.


Geez! We were in public. I needed to be more composed.


"Thank you for the vivid description of how long I'll be stuck with the monster." I rolled my eyes.


"Monster? He doesn't look like a monster, Ly. He's the complete opposite."


I rolled my eyes again, refusing to dignify that with words.


We were soon interrupted by the presence of Kael.Geez,I preferred dealing with Nerion.


Kael was always grumpy and short tempered, while Nerion was the gentle one. I wasn't surprised Jaris picked Karl as his beta. The two were a perfect match made in Hades.


"Ms. Harper." He kept his gaze solely on me, not even glancing at Jace. "I'd advise you keep your distance from men. This is a public event, and as you must know, people tend to make news out of things like this. It might get out bad when they discover you had been engaged to Jaris the whole time."


Woah. Just when I thought I'd seen the worst id it.


But what men have I been with exactly?


"Are these Alpha Jaris' words or yours?" Jace asked with a grimace. Kael finally looked at him, but his eyes were icy."Doesn't matter to you. What matters is they weren't referred to you."


"Well, sadly, I'm not wearing a skirt and a wig. So please, don't tell me the men she's meant to stay away from is me."


Kael shrugged. "If you think yourself a man, why not."




Jace huffed. "I am more of a man than you can ever be,brute."


"Really? You didn't fight like one at the restaurant the other day. Or maybe it's because I'm just a lot stronger.I hardly noticed whatever skills you've been honing for years."


This seemed to get to Jace more. The mirth vanished from his eyes as he stepped up to Kael.


Oh, please. I couldn't deal with this again. Not anymore.


"Jace..." I tried to hold him, but he wrenched his hand free.


"Are you sure about that?" He was staring Kael right in the eye. "If I remember correctly,you left with some really bad bruises. Unless you want to pin it on a Halloween costume."


"Like you said, 'if you remember correctly'. I guess now we know you also have memory problems."


"Guys, please stop." I stepped in their middle.


It was a good thing they hadn't drawn any attention yet.


I turned to Jace. "Jace, it is the King's funeral. Trust me, the last thing your father wants is you getting your knuckles bloody here."


I turned to Kael next. "I heard you, and for the sake of peace, I'll avoid every man here at the party. Thank you.Now,can you go? Please."


| desperately prayed in my heart that Jace wouldn't utter another word. Thankfully, Kael left, but not without giving Jace a threatening glare.


"I honestly don't know how long I can put up with this," I said to Jace with frustration.


If I had known Jaris would be this controlling,I never would've left Draconis to listen to what father had to say.


Jace had gone back to drinking, but I could tell he was really pissed.


"I need some air," I muttered and left the hall.


But as soon as I stepped outside, I regretted my decision.
###Chapter 24

 LYRIC


Seriously, I can't deal with this right now.


I turned around to leave, but as expected, he was faster and rushed to stand in my way.


"Please, I can't do this. I'm not doing this with you," I said with irritation while avoiding his gaze.


"Really?" He scoffed. "Don't you think that's a little harsh for someone you're still bonded to?"


I gave him a fierce, cutting stare. "I am not bonded to you! Every connection we had ended the moment you rejected me as your mate, Roderick."


"Is that so? I doubt the ribbon at the temple would agree, though."


He stepped back, as if to properly admire me. "Well,you look stunning, Lyric. I promise, if I had seen this part of you five years ago, I'd have treated you better."


I crossed my arms, hating that he had the privilege to evenlook at me right now.


"My father has been trying to reach you. You've been ignoring both of us, Roderick, and you know it's important."


"Yeah, I know. And I'm so sorry. But don't worry,Lyric, I'm ready to meet your father. He and I need to talk about our remating ceremony."


"Sorry, our what?" My face crumpled like I'd just tasted lime. "I've told you; you're more than delusional if you think I'd ever get back with you.Even if you were the last male on earth, I'd rather remain single till the end of my life."


"Hm. Speaing about being single..." he tsked. "You wouldn't happen to slept with anyone while you were away,right?"


My chest swelled with the emotions threatening to consume me.Memories of the nights he would come home with different women and make out with them in our matrimonial bed haunted me. He had been a true monster! He despised me so much he wouldn't even touch me for once.


In that little moment, I was tempted to tell him I had given my virginity to someone else on the very day he broke up with me. How lovely his reaction would be.


"Fuck you, Roderick." I turned to leave, but his hand grabbed mine.


"Let me go!" I struggled with him, then suddenly,felt a new presence. A familiar one.


"Is there something going on here?"


My heart skipped a beat as I turned to find Jaris watching us, a glass of wine in his hand.


Oh, no. No. Roderick and Jaris shouldn't be in the same sentence.


"Alpha Jaris," Roderick called with a small smile, releasing my hand. "Please, go back to the party.There's nothing here you should bother yourself with."


Jaris' face remained impassive. "Are you sure?Because you seem to be troubling something that's of importance to me."


Something? Hold on, was he referring to me as a tool?


Roderick seemed surprised. His gaze slid between Jaris and I.


"Do you... know her?" He asked.


"I more than know her. Actually, we're getting mated in a few days. So, I ask again, Roderick, is there something going on here?"


I watched Roderick's jaw drop, and my stomach did the same.


No. Roderick couldn't tell him we were still bonded.

That would totally ruin things for me. "Are you being serious?" He huffed."You...and Lyric are getting bonded?"


I turned quickly to face Roderick, turning my back on Jaris as I whispered. "Please, we'll finish this conversation some other time. For now, could you just leave?"


"What's going on?" Jaris demanded, coming closer.


Oh,no.


Roderick looked speechless. But above all, he looked angry.


"Please," I mouthed to him.


I felt I'd already pissed Jaris off enough and news like this would really tip the scales. But thankfully, by some unexplainable miracle, Roderick listened.


"We are not done," he grumped before angrily walking away.


I took a deep quiet breath.


"What is going on with you two? What aren't you done with?" Jaris snapped, getting in my face.


Good Moon.NJow,I have to deal with this.


"It's-It's nothing."


Staring into his face, all I could see was irritation.


"Lyric Harper, who exactly are you?" His voice was colder than an Arctic breeze. "Do you really have this much complications with men? Will I have issues with my Lunaalways found flirting with men?"


"No!" My voice was near a shout. By the moon, I hate it when he implies that I'm loose. "I promise you, it's not what you think. I'm not like that."


Gods, it hurt. It hurts to have to defend myself against such absurd accusations.


"Are you sure about that? Because so far, I've been dealing with the men in your life. Just three days ago,you were dancing almost naked in a club with men who you let romance you as they please. Then, you got followed by two men whose clear intentions were to force themselves on you. Yet, when I saved you, you were furious like I'd interrupted something good.And now, today, I've had to deal with-how many is it?"


I wanted to scream. It was too much to take in.


"Okay, first; I was never naked to the club. I didn't know I had to watch my dress sense since I was still very much single. Secondly, I'm telling you, I have nothing with these men."


"Then, explain Roderick to me at least."


"It's... It's complicated!"


I sighed. Goodness, it was really complicated. He'd get really mad if I told him I was still bonded to Roderick. It might be considered a breach of contract and I could get locked up for real.


What have I gotten myself into?


His jaw drew tight. "You disobeyed me today when you left my chauffeur hanging."


I forced myself not to roll my eyes. "I told Kael over the phone.I wanted to go with my father."


"I don't take lightly to disobedience, Lyric." He stepped toward me. "And tonight, you'll understand how dire the consequences of your actions can be.Tonight, I'll punish you; make you feel hurt deep in the bones. Tonight, you'll learn never to disobey me.Ever again."


My lips were dropped open in shock as I watched him speak. His eyes looked so threatening, and it didn't sound like they were empty threats. He was going to hurt me...tonight.

###Chapter 25
LYRIC


When he turned to leave, I took off in a pursuit. "Fine!Let's talk."


But he didn't break his stride or spare me a glance.


Damnit. All he made were threats and I was already losing my mind.


"Okay, I'm sorry. Alright? I was just pissed over what happened with the guy from the club. And-And the fact that I couldn't terminate the contract. I felt tricked. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have reacted the way l did."


But he still didn't look at me. Damn him, he was as hard as rock.


Reaching the entrance of the hall, he went in without sparing as little as a glance at me. And in that moment, I knew I was fucked.






I couldn't enjoy a thing from the rest of the funeral.All I wanted was for it to come to an end so I could run to my hotel.


Or maybe I could go now. That way, I'd get to escape whatever Jaris had planned for me.


Yet, a part of me was still scared to leave without his knowledge or permission or something.


The rumors were not complete. Jaris was a bigtime manipulator. Knew how to mess with people's heads.


I kept my eyes on him all through the party, watching how detached he was from everyone he met.


He looked so different from the man I'd slept with five years ago. Had he simply pretended that night to get me to his bed? What went wrong?



JARIS


Fear was one of the most effective forms of punishment.


I knew that was what Lyric was experiencing,and it brought me a strange sense of satisfaction. And I wasn't even done with her.


No one had ever disobeyed me. I wasn't about to let her make a habit of it.


I could feel her eyes on me, following my every move like a hawk. If we weren't in a public gathering, I was sure she'd have run after me.


My blissful moment was soon interrupted by the arrival of two unpleasant guests.


Zarek and Chloe.


They were holding hands, trying to wear their perfect smiles as they walked toward me.


Zarek Callahan. Alpha of one of the top ten ranking Packs.


On a normal day, we weren't supposed to have any problems. But the issues between Zarek and I were beyond personal.


"Jaris," he gave a curt nod.


I said nothing, sipping from my glass. After all,there were other Alphas he could talk to beside me.


"How have you been, Jaris? I assume the news of the King's death must have hit you really hard." He continued talking.


Now, I was irritated.


"Thaddeus was not my personal King. He was a king to every one of us."


As soon as I spoke, the smile Chloe had been forcing on her face vanished.



The pain was there, very clear now.


I couldn't believe that after five years ago, she still hadn't gotten over it.


"You're right." Zarek nodded. "He was a king to us all. Tell me, who do you think is fit to replace him?" I chuckled.


Oh, truly, it was admirable. How hard he was trying to act normal like he still wasn't pissed about the fact that his current mate hadn't chosen me over him.


Five years ago, Chloe had been madly in love with me, despite knowing I had no intention of being with her.


We only had sex for one night, and she didn't want to let me go. She rejected Zarek who was in love with her, just so she could be with me. She hoped that someday, I'd get to choose her.


But in the end, I had to force her to leave. I wasn't interested in keeping a woman.


Since then, Zarek had been furious with me for bedding the girl he loved. But I still couldn't understand how it was any fault of mine. In my defense, yes he loved her, but she didn't love him and wanted me. Besides, they weren't mated yet.


"I am sure there are many more people that would be delighted to have that conversation with you, Zarek."I emptied the wine in my glass. "For me, I totally have no interest."



Setting the glass down, I walked away.






If there was a good thing about me, it was how accurate my instincts could be sometimes.Something in me told me that little scared Lyric would want to run for the heels after my threat.


So,she wasn't the only one who kept an eye out for me. I did the same. And the moment I realized she was missing,I left the hall.


It didn't take me long to find her scurrying toward the direction of the gate.


Using my Alpha speed, I reached her in three seconds, blocking her way.


She gasped, startled. What? Shouldn't she be used to things like these? "Going somewhere, Lyric?" I taunted her. "We're not done yet."


Her eyes that were always spitting fire now looked frightened. Wow. Lyric Harper, tongue-tied. Quite the sight.


"I don't make empty threats, Ly. And I never forget."


"Please," there was a slight tremor in her voice."Just...Just let it go. Okay? I promise you,no more disobedience."


I halted my steps. She was scared. Like, really scared. Her eyes were glossy, like she wanted to cry.I hadn't even touched her yet. Hadn't told her what plan I had in mind. Yet, she was already shaking.


This meant one thing; she was used to being hurt by others. This fear wasn't just because I'd threatened her,but because she was afraid of the usual pain that came with her being hurt all the time.


I almost felt pity for her. Almost.


But I didn't go back on my threas, unfortunately. Instead, I ended up with a lesser punishment.


"I still can't let you go. I need a way to make you feel pain, Lyric; so you'll always remember not to defy me."


She took a frightening step back. My eyes roamed over he body until it landed on the necklace around her artfully crafted neck.


That necklace.


She's had it on from the first day I saw her in my Pack. And every other time I've seen her, she always had it on.


The pendant-whatever it was-was always hidden in her dress. But from the cord, I could tell it was nothing fancy. Yet she always had it on her like it was very important.


Of course, it was. And no punishment would be more befitting.


Closing the distance between us with a swift move,l yanked it off her neck. Her eyes widened like saucers, her lips forming an exaggerated 'O'.


I'd never seen anyone look more pale before. Right there, she looked like she was about to die.
###Chapter 26 
LYRIC

No.Not that.

He could take anything from me. Not that necklace.

The scanned image was the first valuable thing I had. This was the second. I couldn't afford to be away from it for one second.

I tried to take it back from him, but he pulled his hand away.

"Please, give it back." I couldn't control how shaky my voice was.

He stared at it, like he held some sort of admiration for it. He rolled his thumb along the locket, and in that moment, I yearned for oblivion.

"I think this will do," he nodded. "Goodnight,Lyric."

He turned away.

No. You've got to be kidding me.

"Please, you have it to give it back. You can't take it from me." I ran after him.

I felt cold tears on my cheeks. Oh, damn it.

He kept walking until he reached the parkinglot. Kael and Nerion were already there, the backseat hanging open.

Jaris got in, completely ignoring my pleas. Where the hell was he going?

The door was shut and Kael and Nerion got into the front door.

"Hand it back!" I was angry now, slamming my hand against the window.
The asshole had the guts to stare at me through the window, letting me see how superior he was.

The car started and drove off.

I was losing my mind. I couldn't let him get away with this.

There was a waiting cab nearby and without thinking, I got in. "Follow them!"

The cabby seemed hesitant but went after them.

I cried in the backseat. That locket contained ashes from my babies' clothes. After I lost them, I'd burnt the little clothes I bought for them and put some of the ashes in the locket so I could have it with me all the time.It was my own way of feeling their presence as I had not even been able to get their bodies to bury.

He had no idea-he was holding a locket containing remnants of his babies' belongings. Of course,he didn't care.And if they'd been alive, I wasn't sure I'd have let him come near them. A man like him didn't deserve to be around children.

My cab man followed him until he drove into a suite. But before I could pay the man and rush out of the cab,he was already going through the revolving doors.

I ran after him but was stopped by the security at the door.

"Do you have a reservation, ma'am? If yes, we'd like to see your details." The first one said.

Geez, Jaris was getting farther away.

"I-I don't have a reservation I just need to see someone." My eyes were on Jaris as I answered hurriedly.

"Okay. But first, we'll need to confirm from the person that you're to be let in."

Huh? Jaris would never agree to let me in.

"Fine. I want to make a reservation!"

"I'm sorry, but we're fully booked for the night. If you'd like it, we have other amazing branches we could-"

"I don't give a hoot about your hotel. I just need to see someone, and he's getting away!"
Jaris was already getting into the elevator. My heart crumbled as he pinned me with his gaze, letting me know he won.

"I'm really sorry. These policies are set in place to ensure the safety of our guests. And you know the city's quite busy today.Considering the King's funeral..."

The man continued talking, but his voice was soon blocked out by the roar in my ears

I clutched the sides of my dress as I stared at the elevator which had long gone up. Jaris was gone.With one thing that meant the world to me.

I was so broken, I couldn't leave.

I found a spot to sit within the vicinity, and it was a good thing none of the securities tried to get me to leave.Because I didn't plan on leaving. I was going to stay here and wait for Jaris to give back my necklace.

Having it taken from me suddenly brought back the pain I'd never truly healed from.

My babies. I didn't even get to hold them in my arms. Maybe, my life would've taken a different turn if l hadn't lost them. If the cruel hands of death didn't take them from me.

After my time with Jaris five years ago, I discovered I was pregnant. But since I didn't know who he was back then, and I'd been abandoned by him and everyone else around me, I had to handle the pregnancy myself.

I met a woman-Penelope-who was very kind, took me in and helped me. But unfortunately, my babies died at birth. I never even got to see them. I'd been in an accident and passed out, so an operation had to be done on me to get them out. And when I regained consciousness, I was told they didn't survive.

The only odd thing was the fact that I didn't get to see Penelope either. According to the nurse I'd seen when I woke up, she told me Penelope had an emergency and had to leave.

I'd been looking for Penelope since then but to no avai. I only wanted to know where my babies were buried.I wanted to be able to spend time with them, sometimes.

It's possible she had buried them that night since I was unconscious, but I wanted to know where.
I sat there, in front of the waterfall for hours, my tears not stopping. I was there until late into the night, even when the atmosphere had gotten quiet.

I didn't have a single strength in me anymore. I felt so weak without the locket.

At a point, one of the securities came up to me. But it was out of concern.

"If you don't have a place to stay, I could offer some help. Our storage room is locked right now, but I'm with the keys....”

"I don't need a place to stay," Imuttered weakly without looking at him.

I didn't mind staying here until morning.

However, the more I stayed out here in the cold, hungry and exhausted, my rage toward him amplified.

I heard the departing steps of the security, but not long after, new ones approached. Could they leave me alone?

"Why's it so important?" I gasped and turned at the sound of his voice.

He was there, wearing simpler night outfits but looking every bit of the annoying man that he was.

He had my necklace in his hand, giving it a puzzled look. "You're willing to spend the night here, just to get this back." He held it up. "What makes it so special?"

I sniffled, wiping my tears as I stood up. I avoided his gaze. By the moon, I was so mad at him I wished I could give him a punch. But that would only be me writing my death sentence.

Silence stretched between us for a while. He must've seen that I had no intention of speaking to him, and by some miracle, he handed the necklace back.

"Never disobey me, Lyric. For as long as you're with me."

My answer was a hard glare, my eyes still rimming with unshed tears.

I picked up my purse and walked past him, heading to the gate.
I felt relieved. So so relieved. But I was still wounded that he could be this cruel to do this to me.

Getting to the road, I looked out for cabs. There were still a few cars driving around. I should be able to see one.

Bidding time, I stared at the necklace in my hand, a sad smile touching my lips.

That was the last blissful moment I had for the night as a car, seemingly intentionally, ran into me, bringing me to the ground.
###Chapter 27 
JARIS

I didn't expect her to be so stubborn over a mere necklace.

Unfortunately for me, my suite had been facing the very spot where she was seated. So, I could see how long she spent, being stubborn and refusing to leave without it.

I'd been curious enough to open the locket and to my surprise, it turned out to be ashes.

It was old tradition to burn corpses and preserve their ashes. Nobody did this anymore. So,why would she do it? And who did she do it for?

It made me understand why it was so imnportant to her. And for a reason I couldn't explain, I was forced to go out and hand it back.

She was so furious. Never seen that much anger in her eyes before.

And as she walked out the gate, I continued watching her.

It happened swiftly. She hadn't been in the way or anything, yet a car ran into her, knocking her to the ground.

It felt as though, breath had been knocked out of my lungs.

I acted on impulse, running toward her,ahead of the securities.

The driver took off, leaving her abandoned by the road.

Something was wrong. She had been in the safe lane. Did that car run into her on purpose?

I got to where she was and scooped her into my arms without hesitation. She was passed out and bleeding from the head.

Damnit!

Thankfully, the suite had a health care for urgent situations.

"Have someone follow that car. I want him brought to me!" I ordered the securities around and watched them hurry to execute the order.

I ran into the suite, heading straight to the health care center.



Lyric was well taken care of. It was reassuring when the nurses told me she'd be awake in a few hours.

I got to know she had a dormant wolf. Funny how this was never mentioned to me.

Apparently, it was the reason she couldn't heal on her own.

With the imminent danger out of the way, I ordered her taken to my suite.

I had booked the suite with two rooms. It was the only one available at the timing of booking.

I laid Lyric in the second room, then went out to speak with the securities that had gone after the driver.

Disappointing enough, they'd been unable to catch up with him.

But why would anyone do this to Lyric? It was obvious the car didn't have the intention of killing her. It only wanted to hurt her.

Whoever was behind this, it must be someone who knew she didn't have an active wolf and would take long to heal.

For a strange reason, yet again, this fueled me with so much rage. Even my wolf stirred angrily. WVhy would anyone do this to her?

I called for Nerion who was sharing the next suite with Kael.

Nerion, being my head of security, was very good with digging information. When it came to hacking and being smart, I didn't think he had a rival.

"I need you to find everything you can on Lyric Haper. First, I need to know what her connection is with Roderick Fletcher. And more importantly, find out if she's lost anyone important to her in recent years,and if the person's corpse had gotten incinerated."

One good thing about Nerion was the fact that he enjoyed getting new tasks. He loved it when he was busy.

"Right on it, Alpha," he said witha dip and left.

I returned to Lyric's room, grabbed a chair and watched how peacefully she slept.

Retrieving the necklace from my pocket, I opened the locket and felt a sharp pang in my chest when the ashes came into view.

"Who did you lose, Lyric Harper?" I mnurmured to myself.

****+****+

It was exactly three a.m when she finally woke up. I was still on the chair, going through my phone when l noticed her stir awake.

She looked around, and when her eyes landed on me, surprise clouded her visage.

She looked like she was about to throw a million questions at me, but then she touched her bandaged head,and her expression turned sour.

"You were in an accident," I informed her. Just in case you're forgetting.

"Who was it? Did he wait around?" The way she asked, she must also suspect it was intentional.

I shook my head, hating how disappointing that was. "They couldn't catch up with him."

She darted her eyes around the room for a second time. "Where aml?"

"In my suite."

She looked at me like I'd just told her she'd been sold to me.

"You were in an accident, Lyric. The suite had a health care center. When they were done treating you,I had to bring you to my room. I only had to do this because people would talk if they got to know l abandoned my soon-to-be Luna."

She gave me a quizzical look. "So, you do care what people say, after all."

"I chose my rumours,Lyric."

She touched her neck and paled. Knowing what she was about to ask next, I held the necklace up to her."It's here."

She peeled herself from the bed, coming to get it from me. Well, she had been through a lot. So,I didn't let her struggle for it and just handed it over.

To my surprise, she started for the door.

"What do you think you're doing?" My brows arched.

"I'm leaving."

Right. I thought you were going to fix the door or something.

"I have an extra room where I'll be spending the night. Get back to bed, Lyric."

"I don't want to," she snapped. "Not to sound ungrateful, but don't you think it's your fault I got hit in the first place? If you hadn't taken this from me, I wouldn't have been here in the first place." Her eyes flashed with hurt.

Maybe she had the right to be mad, but I didn't really care. The least she could do was thank me for letting her touch my bed.

She wrapped her hand around the door's knob. The woman was getting on my nerves.

"Damn it, Lyric! Get back here before I do something crazy!"

That did the trick. She visibly shuddered and looked at me with a kind of fear.

Okay. Maybe that came out harsher than expected. But there was only little I could do when I had someone constantly upsetting me. A fucking tear dropped to her cheek. But she walked away from the door, back to the bed, sitting with a huff and her arms crossed. Well, I didn't care that she looked like a brewing hurricane right now. As long as she was there.

"If you need anything, ring the landline," I told her before taking my leave.

Honestly, I wasn't sure I could survive one year with this woman. She was frustratingly infuriating.
###Chapter 28
LYRIC

I kept counting the hours until morning.

As soon as it was the break of dawn, I planned on leaving immediately.

But when morning came, I was surprised by a breakfast buffet, a new dress, and a nurse checking on me.

I didn't want to believe that Jaris had thought of these himself.

I freshened up, changed into the fresh dress-a cute black knee-length gown, by the way-and ate to my fill.

The nurse remnoved the bigger bandage around my head, having it replaced with a small patch. She also told me I was fine and could move about. Not like I had any intention of staying over.

When I finished and went to the other room, I found Jaris already dressed, talking with Kael and Jaris.

Right. He had the general Alphas' meeting to attend. Even my father was attending.

I waited for him to finish with his men before I greeted him and told him I was leaving.

"We're leaving together," he cocked his head at the door.

Kael and Nerion must have had to do something else because they didn't follow us out of the room.

I walked behind Jaris as we reached the elevator and waited for it to open up. When it did open, there were two occupants inside, people I recognized-Alpha Zarek and his Luna, Chloe. I had met them at the funeral last night.

I noticed their eyes dim the moment they saw Jaris. Well, I wasn't surprised Jaris had a lot of enemies.

After a slight hesitation, he stepped into the elevator, and I did the same.

Alpha Zarek and his Luna were behind us, the air in the small space tense.
"I didn't know you had a woman now," Zarek said."Congratulations."

Jaris chuckled. "Quite funny. I didn't know you considered it an achievement. It explains why you were quite sad when a certain woman left you."

Okay. What the hell was going on?

Fortunately, nothingelse was said until the elevator reached the ground floor.

"Lyric, right?" Zarek called as we all stepped out of the elevator.

I didn't say anything, but he smiled at me.

"It was nice meeting you," he uttered the words with a certain menace. Then, he smirked at Jaris and left with his Luna, whose face seemed to be covered in shame.

Jaris didn't utter a word, but I could tell he was pissed. We left the reception and headed for his car.


······

JARIS

As soon as I dropped Lyric off at the suite her father had reserved, I proceeded to The Silver Citadel for the Alphas' meeting. I'd rather be anywhere but here, but it was mandatory as important matters had to be discussed.

Half an hour later, the meeting fully commenced

Every single Alpha was present. The seating arrangement was far from normal. It was arranged in a ring-like position with the Alphas sitting according to their ranks.

The Pack Overseers-which were the Lycan Chairman and Representatives-sat in the first circle.

The second row was occupied by the Sovereign Alphas-which was my Pack and nine others.

The Alphas of the major Packs followed, and then the minor Packs were last. Those ones hardly had a say in public matters.
The Lycan Chairman gave the opening speech, talking about the late King and how good of a leader he had been. He hinted at the fact that investigations into his death were still ongoing.

After that, he brought up some pressing issues like hanging taxes and...

Then, we arrived at the main reason for the gathering-the throne of the Alpha King.

"As we all know, it cannot be vacant for long. Someone would have to fill that space. Someone worthy, of course.Since King Thaddeus' death was untimely, he was unable to recommend anyone. So now, we'd have to do it the usual way. But as we all know, only the Sovereign Alphas can partake in the challenge for the throne."

I drank some water while the Chairman spoke about the rules.

"Now, from the Sovereign Alphas, which of you would like to partake in the challenge?"

All nine of them lifted their hands. I suppressed the urge to scoff.Seriously?

Seconds passed. The Chairman was yet to move on to the next phase. I noticed all eyes were shifting to me.Then,I suddenly realized what the problem was.

"Jaris?" The Chairman called. "Are you not...participating?"

"If I was, my hand would be up. I've been attentive, Luca." My reply stunned everyone.

"Are you trying to say... you are not interested in taking the throne?" One of the representatives asked. He was among those who hadvisited my Pack.

I shrugged, nonchalant. "I honestly have no interest."

I loved power, but I was already getting enough of that, being the Alpha of Darkspire. Almost everyone would bow to my will. I didn't feel like getting my hands dirty for the extra position.

"Wow." Zarek, who was sitting across from me, clapped. "I never knew you were so generous, Jaris."

I bet he'd be grateful. With me out of the picture, Zarek was the one with a higher chance of winning.

Yeah,he could kiss my feet.
*****

When the meeting finally came to an end, I went over to the Citadel's bar to pour myself a glass of Bourbon.

"I'm curious, Jaris. Why aren't you participating in the Alpha challenge?" Zarek asked as he joined me at the counter.

I forced composure into my bones. Could anyone get him away from me?

"Tell me, is it because you do not have a Luna yet?" He leaned against the counter, staring into my face with that smirk I'd very much love to get rid of.

One of the requirements for participating in the Alpha challenge was to have a Luna. Funny how they thought I couldn't easily get a Luna if I wanted.

A date for the commencement of the challenge had been fixed, and it was to begin in a few weeks.

"What about the lady I saw you with at the suite? She was quite beautiful."

"Is your own woman suddenly not enough, Zarek? It's a bit shameful to compliment my own woman in front of me." I swigged from my glass while he laughed.

"Do you think she'd be as loose as Chloe was?" His face grew more serious as he asked. "If she's tempted,do you think she'll cheat on you without hesitation?"

I shrugged. "Chloe left you for me. Take a good look at 'me,' Zarek. Do you think anyone can beat me?"

"You're not the hottest guy on earth, Jaris. How about we give this a bet?" His eyes beamed. "If you promise not to interfere, I think I can get your woman to sleep with me in seven days."

I cocked my head to meet his gaze. "Really,Z?"

"Yes." He shrugged. "Unless you are certain that she's loose and can easily be seduced."

"She's not loose." My voice came out clipped.

"Then, you have nothing to be afraid of, Jaris. Give me seven days, and I'll show you how loose your woman can be. Believe me, she'll be begging to return to my arms."
###Chapter 29
LYRIC

The following day, Father and I returned home to the Pack, as did every Alpha.

I was exhausted and simply wanted a shower and a bath, but my sister had a way of getting in the way of my wants.

"How was your stay in Blystara?" She asked as I walked toward the door of my room. "Ooh. Looks like you ran into a bit of trouble," she pointed at the patched part of my head.

It actually didn't hurt anymore. In a couple of days, the mark would be completely gone.

"I'm fine, Nora. Just go, please."

She couldn't accompany us to the funeral as she had something very important to take care of. She had been somewhat depressed since Roderick started treating her like trash. But it really wvasn't my fault.

"I hope the driver was really hard," she suddenly said when I was about to open my door.

Wait, what? I furrowed my horse as I looked at her. She was wearing a smug smile with her arms crossed over her chest.

"I mean, I did tell him to be reallý hard on you. I hope you felt every crushing pain for hours."

My eyes widened like a startled deer caught in headlights. No way!

"That was you!?" I stepped toward her, disbelief clouding my expression. "You hired someone to do that to me?"

She casually shrugged. "I wasn't there, but I'm sure it must've hurt like a bitch."

"You're sick! I'll make sure you pay for this."

"Oh, really? How exactly? It's not like you have any evidence. Or do you really think Father wouuld believe l actually tried to hurt you?" She scoffed. "Go in and rest, Lyric. And keep watching your back."

She walked away, leaving me brimming with rage.



I had gone to father to report the issue to him, but he was so busy with numerous calls I didn't get the chance to meet him.

I decided to tell him later because there was no way I was letting the little witch get away with this.

I felt a little better after showering and was taking a nap when a call woke me up. To my surprise, it was Jaris.

We both hadn't spoken since he dropped me off at my suite yesterday.

"Hello?G-"

"How fast can you get to Darkspire?" He cut me off, sounding very urgent.

The remnants of sleep vanished from my eyes.

"Uh..." I checked the time. "I-I don't really know. It's-"

"I need you here, Lyric. Now. It's important."



I changed into a pair of jeans and a T-shirt and headed to Darkspire. Jaris didn't tell me what the problem was, and it made me even more anxious.

Reaching Darkspire, a maid was already waiting outside and led me to where Jaris was. It turned out to be the kids' room.

My heart shattered as a hint entered my mind.

I hurried into the room, and as expected, Xylon was shaking in bed. His sister was on the floor beside him,crying her eyes out, while Jaris sat on a chair next to the bed. Though he looked calm, I could see the worry in his eyes.

He stood as soon as I entered. "When I called, it wasn't this serious. What took you so long?"

I frowned at his tone. Why was he mad at me? I decided to brush it aside, realizing he was going through a lot of emotions.

"I need a bowl of warm water, please. And some napkins," I said to no one in particular as I hurried to sit on the bed. Carefully, I placed his head on my legs.

The maids in the room hurried to get what I wanted.

"And some Cinnamon, if there's any available!" I added.

Xylon's skin was like hot coal. He was burning up and shaking terribly. Tears rimmed my eyes. I didn't want to start imagining how painful this must be for him.

"Don't worry, everything will be fine. I'm here now. It's going to be fine." I spoke in hushed tones as I cradled his face.




Less than thirty minutes later, Xylon was completely fine and asleep on my legs.

I smiled as I stared into his face, my fingers lightly stroking his hair.

He was so handsome when he looked this peaceful. My heart hurt for him. Jaris had mentioned him going through this since he was two. So, he had been suffering from this for three years. It was a horrible thing a child as cute and innocentas he had to endure.

I carefully rested his head on a pillow and followed Jaris out of the room.

"Thank you," he said with a slight furrow in his brow as we stood in the passage. His eyes were lowered to the floor as though he was contemplating something. "I didn't entirely believe it when Xyla told me how quickly you had treated her brother the other day. It almost doesn't seem real." He met my gaze. "How do you do it?" I shrugged and sighed. "Honestly, I don't even know how l do it. I'm just glad I'm able to save people when l need it to."

Jaris nodded. "It's a blessing, then."

Oh, trust me; it's also a curse. They didn't know it, but this had gotten me into a lot of trouble.

"The date for the coronation ceremony had been fixed. It's happening in seven days," he said, distracting me a little.

"Oh, okay." I guess nothing would be getting in the way again.

"But what do you say about moving in before then? You're quite helpful being around Xylon."

I glanced at the door before nodding. I honestly didn't have an issue with it. If I could help the little boy in any way, I wouldn't hesitate to jump at the offer.

"I'll do it. I think it'd be better if I move in today so I can commence full treatment on him tomorrow."

His eyes softened. Wow. Jaris Dreadmoor looked at me tenderly.

In that fleeting moment, I caught a glimpse of the man I'd spent the night with five years ago. The man who had called me 'Princess' when everyone else called me ugly.

"I appreciate that you're doing this for him. It doesn't go unnoticed." He said.

Hm.Who would've thought that Jaris could actually be polite?

I dipped my head and turned toward the door.

"Lyric?" He called, bringing me around to look at him. "Could you be extra careful this week? You know,thécoronation is just around the corner. I wouldn't want anything ruining it."

"And... by being careful, you mean-don't go clubbing? Don't hang out with my male friend..." I suppressed the urge to roll my eyes. "Those are really not the problem, Alpha Jaris."

"Just do as I say and stop arguing." There was slight irritation in his voice. Woah. The old Jaris slipping through the cracks.

"I heard you." As I turned to open the door, I rolled my eyes since he couldn't see me.

JARIS

I'd never seen anyone with her kind of healing skills.

I've watched Marta struggle to stop Xylon's epistles within hours. But right in front of me, Lyric used minutes.

But it also meant good news for Xylon. Hopefully, she'd be able to treat him before the end of our year contract.

Now...I actually hope she'll still be alive by then. She deserved to.

Nerion was waiting in my study room when I entered. He was leaning against my table, reading a newspaper.

"Welcome back, Boss. I trust Xylon is much better?" He lowered the paper from his face.

"He is. How is Kael and te task I assigned to him?"

"He's doing great. Will be back any moment."

I nodded and took my seat, taking out some documents.

"I actually have information on the task you assigned."

I dropped the documents and focused on him. I was more interested in Lyric Harper.

"And... I don't think you're going to like what I found."
###Chapter 30
JARIS

I didn't like the sound of that.

"I don't need to beg you for information, Nerion. What did you find?" There was slight irritation in my voice.

"Actually," he took the seat across from me. "she has previously been mated to Alpha Roderick."

What?

"They got mated when she was eighteen, but as soon as Roderick got what he wanted-which was going up the ranks-he dumped her."

Woah. That didn't sound good. I bet Mother mustn't have been aware of this. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been so quick to push her to me.

But if things were over between them, why was Roderick all over her at the party?

"When did they break up?" I asked.

"Five years ago."

I shot a surprised stare at Nerion. That long? Goes a long way to explain why the news wasn't common.

"Are there any photos from when she and Roderick were together?"

"Sadly, no. It was quite surprising when I couldn't even find any old pictures of her. Turned out Lyric wasn't fully involved with her family before now. I don't know why, but she didn't take pictures of herself."

Well, that's strange.Who wouldn't have pictures of themselves?

"And what about the death of a loved one?" I asked.

Nerion shook her head. "The last time she lost someone important was when she was six years old when her mother died. And I confirmed that the woman was buried and never incinerated. Since then, she hasn't lost anyone important to her."

Not what I'd been expecting. That locket contained the ashes of a loved one. If she hadn't lost anyone from her fammily, whose ashes were she wearing around,then?

"After she broke up with Roderick, what has she been doing?" I asked a moment later.

"Nobody knows. They say she had suddenly vanished for five years and just returned not long ago."

Suddenly vanished? That didn't make any sense.

"I need to know where she's been, Nerion. Find out everything you can on her from the last five years."

I didn't know why, but I couldn't help but feel that something was missing from her.

LYRIC

I kept Xyla company until her brother came awake. I'dalso intentionally stayed behind because I wanted to make sure the boy was fine enough for me to leave.

"How're you feeling, Xylon?" Xyla asked, holding his hand.

His eyes went round until they fell on me. He looked weak, but I caught a glimpse of happiness in them.

"You... saved me. A...Again." the words were muttered.

He didn't strike me like someone that stammered. I think he was just scared of speaking. Why was he so scared?

"I did. And now, I need a gift from you." I beamed at him, lightly massaging his scalp.

He looked intrigued."Help?"

"Yes. And that will be you telling me what you want to eat."

His nanny said he hardly ate, especially after an epistle. Something about him being too sad to eat. He lowered his eyes from mine, not saying a word.

"Xylon?"

He looked at me again, then ordered for his writing tab. It was quickly given to him by his nanny, and I watched with interest as he wrote on it:

"Will you eat with me?"

HHis question stunned me. What in the name of the moon? And why did it make me want to cry?

"Of course," I chuckled, my hands going softer in his hair. I was trying so hard to fight back the tears."Just tell me what you want to eat, and we can get on with it."



Xylon ended up ordering mini corn dogs, Caprese salad, and macaroni and cheese. And the three of us all ate together.

I ensured he finished his meal. Even his nannies were surprised.

Xylon grabbed his tablet again, writing something down on it. I realized he made use of it when he wanted to have a long conversation, which would be difficult for him to communicate through speech.

"Have you considered working in a hospital?" He showed it to me when he was done writing.

Woah.Another unexpected question.

"Um... I used to want to work there when I was a kid. But not anymore."

"Why?" This time, it was Xyla who asked.

I'd have actually loved to work in a hospital, but after what happened three years ago, I wasn't sure I wanted to get into more trouble.

Xylon scribbled down on his tablet. "A lot of people are suffering, Aunty. I go to the hospital most of the time, and I see people worse than me. If you can help them, it'd be really nice." His words left my heart in fragments. How touching that he was more concerned about others in his condition. With the pain he was going through, he must feel really bad that they went through worse.

"Will you do it, Aunty? You'd be helping a lot of people," Xyla winked at me.

I chuckled.

Ugh. Why were these kids having so much influence on me? Now, I couldn't get the image of people suffering out of my head.

"I'll think about this. How about that?" I said with a smile.

Much to my astonishment, Xylon hugged me.

Woah!

"Thank you, Aunty. I had a good feeling about you the first day I saw you."
###Chapter 31
LYRIC

A while later, I left to grab my belongings. Coincidentally, Jace had come around to deliver something to father.

Father was thrilled when I told him of my plan to move to Darkspire. It served as a kind of assurance that the contract was going through, and he'd have nothing to worry about.

As for Jace, he insisted on accompanying me to Darkspire. In his words, he wanted to help me move in.

I told him about Jaris' new rules, but he didn't seem to care. Seeing that he was stubborn, I decided to call Jaris.

"Please, believe me when I say Jace is merely a friend. He means no harm and only wants to help." I tried to sound as convincing as I could.

By some miracle, he approved of it. Hm. Jaris Dreadmoor was showing a different side of him today, and I think I prefer this side.

Jace helped me gather my things while teasing me about my new role.

"Make sure you don't get pregnant. I know Jaris is awfully handsome, and there's no doubt that he's quite big down there.But your contract is only for a year, Ly. Trust me, you don't wanna end up with a baby all by yourself," Jace said as he folded some clothes into my luggage.

I rolled my eyes. Well, I did know what Jaris looked and felt like down there. He was the first man I ever had,and it was the best feeling I'd felt in a while.

"Don't worry, there'll be no sex between us," I told Jace as I dusted my shoes.He made that perfectly clear in the contract. No form of intimacy, no catching feelings... nothing.

As for the baby part, I already had two and lost them. I didn't want to relive that pain. "That is what every woman says until a man tickles their ear and tells them how beautiful they are." Jace casually said, and I threw a pillow at him.

When we finished packing up my things, he helped me take them to the car with the aid of some guards while I spoke to Father.

"What do we do with Roderick? The ceremony's in a few days. Right now, I can't breach the contract."

"I know. I know, Lyric." Father looked troubled. "I'll try to get to Roderick today. If he doesn't cooperate, I'll have to seek extra help."

I told him to act fast because I didn't trust Roderick anymore since he was now aware of my engagement with Jaris.

Jace and I drove to Darkspire. I was shown to my room, and my belongings were taken in for me.

Jace helped me make some extra arrangements in the room, though I didn't think it was needed. The room was quite large, well-furnished, and very beautiful. It was far more beautiful than what I had in Ravencrest.

"Thank you so much, Jace. You didn't have to go through this stress," I told him when he rounded up with the last wallpaper he was fixing on the wall.

"Oh, don't mention, Ly. You're like a daughter to me. I got to do this for you."

I hit him on the back, earning an 'ouch' and a chuckle.

Afterward, we decided to take a walk around the Pack before he left. It was already evening, and his Pack was quite far away.

We came across a big room that resembled a bar and went in. There were a few people there, drinking.

We could see their wine collections at the counter, and it was a whole lot.

"Wow. I must say Darkspire has got good taste." Jace said with a nod as we walked toward the counter.

There, we requested a scotch whiskey.

"How much does it cost?" Jace asked, dipping his hand into his back pocket. "You don't have to pay for these. They're free to every member of Darkspire," the bartender said, surprising me.

Jace and I exchanged a glance.

"Now, this is an attribute of a real pack!" He laughed. "If I'd known I'd be getting free drinks every day, I'd have found a way to become a member long ago."

I shook my head. These drinks were expensive. Giving it out to hundreds of people daily for free...

Darkspire must have a lot of money.

Our shots were served, but Jace wanted something more. He was pointing at certain drinks on the counter when I turned to the door and found Marta approaching, a young lady beside her.

Ugh. Kill-joy.

I didn't look away when her eyes found mine. But I did notice something else. When Jace turned slightly to ask me a question, and Marta caught a glimpse of his face, she stopped walking.

Jace looked away, continuing his conversation with the bartender. But Marta looked like she'd seen a ghost.

Her lips parted open. Quickly, she turned around and scurried out the door.

In seconds, she was gone.

Huh? My brows furrowed in confusion. What was so wrong with her? Was Jace the reason she had that reaction? Or was it something else?

He finished placing his order and properly faced me.

"Jace, do you know-" I was interrupted by my phone ringing.

I thought of ignoring it. But when I noticed it was Roderick,I excused myself to take the call.

"Roderick. I want to believe you're calling to ask me to meet you at the temple." I looked around the balcony to ensure there was no one around. "Spare me the drama, Lyric. When were you going to tell me you were engaged to Jaris?" He sounded pissed.

What?Was he insane?

"And why do I need to tell you anything? You have no position in my life, Roderick."

"Damnit! Stop saying that!"

Roderick was furious. He had the right to be furious because I was engaged to Jaris? Oh! He was a joker.

"He doesn't know wve're still bonded, does he?" He grumped.

"We're not bonded! We already rejected each other five years ago! As soon as that little stepis completed-"

"It is never getting completed, Lyric. And you know you can't be with someone else if we aren't through. It's forbidden."

"Yes! Which is why we'll be breaking the bond before the ceremony."

He laughed. The asshole actually laughed like it was funny.

"Now, this is what will happen," the laughter was gone from his voice. "You have until the end of today to tell Jaris the truth and end things with him. If you don't, I'll come over myself tomorrow and spill the beans.Trust me, I'll make it more embarrassing. What do you think the people of Darkspire would think when they learn you were trying to become their Luna while bonded to another? It'll make you look desperate, Lyric.And I don't think Jaris would want to be associated with a woman like that. So, I'm giving you the opportunity to make this less humiliating."

My heart swelled with rage. I wanted to punch Roderick in the jaw. I wanted to see him beaten to a pulp.

"Fuck off!" I growled into the phone and angrily dropped the call.

Ugh! I hate him! How did I ever feel a thing for him before now?

I quickly called father to give himan update. He was pissed as he was worried and told me he was going to contact the Priestess at the temple tonight. We were still talking when suddenly, I heard noises coming from the bar.

I dropped the call without bidding bye to father as I rushed toward the bar, thinking about Jace.
###Chapter 32
LYRIC

I stepped out of the bar for a few minutes, but Jace was already in trouble.

Broken tables. Smashed glasses. Chairs flipped upside down.

The place was in chaos as people struggled to separate the two men engaging in a serious brawl.

Jace and Kael.

By the moon, not again!

"Jace! Jace!" I shouted, pushing my way through the mess.

"Having a friendly conversation!" he yelled back, just before dodging a punch.

I grabbed his arm, trying to pull him away, but he shook me off like a damn wet leaf. They kept going at each other,tossing chairs, knocking over drinks-basically turning the bar into a battleground.

How in Selene's name did this happen?

It took Nerion's intervention to bring an end to the madness.

I stood in front of Jace, panting and glaring at both him and Kael. How could they do this in front of so many people?

"I need an apology from him. This instant! Before he steps a foot out of this place!" Kael demanded angrily.

Boy,was he pissed.

Jace wiped blood from his lip with the back of his palm.

"Apology? Sure. I'm sorry that your feelings are more fragile than a soap bubble." As usual, Jace's mouth knew how to make situations worse. "I am telling you," Kael pointed a finger at him. "If you don't apologize to me, you're not leaving."

"Kael, please!" I stepped in. "I'm-I'm sorry for whatever he did. Could you let it go?"

"Please, stay out of this, Lyric. I don't have an issue with you. Your friend, however, seems to like them a lot,and I'm here to show him just how much he can get from me."

"Oh, come on!" Jace raised his hands. "If you want to act like a little bitch, at least wear a dress to complete the look."

Kael lunged forward, but Nerion clamped a hand on his shoulder.

Finally,with Nerion's intervention, Kael was pulled away from the bar, leaving Jace alone. Now that I confirmed that Jace was safe, I let myself be mad at him.

"It's late. You should go."

I walked ahead of him, and then he caught up with me outside the bar.

"Fuck, I didn't get to finish my drink. Who knows when next I'd be seeing a free drink," he grumped to himself.

What?

that seriously all you're bothered about?" I whipped around so fast my hair nearly slapped him. "Come on,Jace.What yo did in there wasn't cool!"

"And how's it my fault? The dude attacked me, Ly. Was I supposed to just cross my arms and thank him for reconstructing my face?"

"Look, I don't know what happened, but I damn know you're not innocent. I told you what Jaris said to me earlier. He doesn't want a scandal in any way."

"Well,your hair and face look perfectly fine. So, I don't think you're the one who got engaged in a fight. And trust me, I wasn't screaming your name while I was fighting."

"Jace!" "Goodnight, Lyric. Go on and have a beautiful sleep." He walked ahead of me. Suddenly,he paused and turned to me. "But know this, the wine here is damn good. So, prepare to see more of me." He added and walked off.



I was scared that Jaris would confront me regarding the fight and I'd be in more trouble, but fortunately,he didn't.

It was a good thing because I had a bigger problem to worry about. Roderick's threat still hung over my head.

I stayed awake until late into the night, thinking of a way out of it. I couldn't bring myself to tell Jaris the truth. No. He was already of the opinion that I was loose and all. Confessing to him that I was someone else's rejected mate and was still currently bound to that person wasn't going to look good on me.

I couldn't let Jaris discover the truth.

I kept thinking until I slept off.



By morning, I went to check on Xylon. He and Xyla were having breakfast in the dining room,looking smart in their uniforms. They were both excited to see me.

"So, today, I'll be going to get some herbs and other things we'll need to make you better." I happily informed him.

He took up his writing tab, penning down on it. "Will I really get better?"

There was so much hope in his eyes. I was determined to do everything I could tomake sure he didn't get disappointed.

My smile broadened as I tousled his hair. "Yes, darling. You won't have to go through those painful epistles again."

"Oh! That'd be so great, Aunty!" Xyla clapped her hands. "I really hope this works out." "Step away from them." A cold,familiar voice suddenly said.

Looking ahead, I saw her entering the room like a queen.

She was corporately dressed, her heels clacking against the floor.Her eyes seemed to spit fire as she glared at the proximity between me and the kids. I was actually sitting next to Xylon.

Calmly, I stood up.

"Who let her in?" She looked around at the two nannies in the room. "Aren't you aware that my kids shouldn't be disturbed when they're eating?"

Xylon and Xyla didn't just stop eating; their expressions went sour.

"Please, don't blame it on the nannies. I think I have the right to be around Xylon, especially. Maybe you should speak to the Alpha for better clarification."

Her eyes burned brighter with resentment. "I don't need to speak to anyone. You don't have the right to be around my kids without my consent."

Huh? "I just told you; I'm taking care of-"

"Then, you treat him when it's necessary instead of throwing yourself at my kids."

My jaw dropped in shock.What!?

She shifted her eyes to the nannies. "Bring them to the car. Let's go."

She walked out of the room, arrogance radiating from every pore in her skin.



Marta was something else. I sincerely hoped she wouldn't be giving mea tougher time here.

An hour later, I was ready to go for Xylon's herbs. My mind drifted to Roderick and his stupid threat.Although, I'll admit-I was a little scared.

Nerion was waiting outside with a car. "Alpha Jaris wants you to go out with this," he handed the keys to me. "And this." He handed a card next."It's a black card. You can pay for anything you want with it. The pin is two-two-five--five."

Now, this was interesting. Black cards were only used by the richest Alphas. From what I heard, only five Alphas in the world owned this, and it meant unlimited funds.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised, considering the fact that Jaris was ruling the highest-ranking Pack.

"Thanks for the card, but I think I can make use of my car." It was brought to me earlier that morning since Jace and I had arrived in his own car yesterday.

"No offense, but the Alpha doesn't want you driving around in that when there's something better," Nerion said,surprising me.

Huh? What was he talking about? Although it was my father's cheapest car, it wasn't bad at all.

"No argument, Lyric. Just drive. Please." He really said it like a plea.

I rolled my eyes and made to open the door.

"Do you need someone to come along?" Nerion asked, holding the doors open for me.

Ugh. He was so gentle. Why couldn't his colleague, Kael, be like him?

"No,thanks. I'm good."

The door was shut, and I hit the road.

Okay, I won't lie; this car felt good to drive.



It was a long drive from Darkspire to where I was headed, and I was relieved when I finally arrived.

It was known as Botanical Bliss-the biggest herb store in the country.

Xylon's condition was a very complicated one, one that was life-threatening. I'd never dealt with it before,yet somehow, I knew of the right things to getthat could help. It was quite strange because this wasn't how the gift worked in my family. Usually, they'd have to do research and all to know what they needed. But that wasn't the case with me. I already knew what was needed just by having a look at the situation.

It was always stunning.

I picked up a basket and went through the list I'd drafted as I walked by the shelves.

"Lyric." Someone suddenly called in front of me.

I stopped abruptly, realizing I'd have bumped into this person if I had taken two more steps.

However, I was met with a surprise. It was Alpha Zarek.

###Chapter 33
LYRIC

I tightened my hold around my shopping basket as I dipped my head.

"Good morning, Alpha Zarek. Sorry, I almost bumped into you."

"Oh, it's nothing." He chuckled. "I didn't know you came to such places.You deal with medicines?"

I simply nodded.

"That's nice. I only came over to check for certain things. It's a good thing that I met you here."

A good thing? Why's it a good thing?

I managed a smile as I stepped away. "Take care, Alpha."

I walked away, continuing with my shopping.

A while later, I was done and went over to the counter to clear my bills. To my surprise, the man at the counter simply packed them up and handed them over without asking me to pay.

"Someone already took care of your bill," he stunned me.

Oh?"Who's that?"

"Alpha Zarek,." He tipped his head behind me.

Turning slightly, I found the Alpha learning against a shelf, waving at me with a weird smile.

Okay...Why would he do a thing like this? I never asked.

Dropping the bags, I went over to meet him. "You didn't have to."

"Please, don't stress your tongue over something so little. It's change,Lyric." "Thanks, but I really don't need it. If you don't mind, I'd like to pay for them myself."

A small frown touched his brow. "Why would you want to do that? Aren't you used to people doing you favors?"

I was just trying to be extra careful like Jaris wanted.

"I'm really sorry, but I can't accept it."

Dipping my hand, I returned to the counter where I took care of it myself.



I played a song and sang along with it as I drove back to Darkspire. This car was pretty smooth. And expensive.Why would Jaris even want me to have it?

Then, I remembered the contract. I had access to every property of Darkspire. Hm.

I reached the Pack House and some maids came over to help me get the things inside.

But before I could go in with them, Kael approached me.

"Lyric.You need to come with me." The look on his face. It wasn't good.

"O...kay. But there's no problem, right?"

He hesitated, then sighed. "It's AIpha Roderick. He's here."



Every nerve in my body went taut. Air abandoned my lungs as I struggled to breath.

Roderick. He was here. To finally ruin me.

I stood rooted to the door for some seconds, not having the courage to move. What if he's told Jaris the truth already? How could he really do this to me?

Kael turned and started waIking head, but he stopped  when he noticed I wasn't following. "You need to move-now. He and Alpha Jaris have been waiting for you for hours."

By the hunt! That son of a bitch! He really did keep to his words!

My hands shook as I retrieved my phone from my purse and called father. Fortunately, he picked up almost immediately.

"Father, Roderick is here." A mix of fear and anger went through my voice.

"What!?"

"He's with Alpha Jaris now. You need to come over. I don't know what to do." I hung up.

I couldn't divulge much, not when Kael was giving me that suspicious stare.

Taking a deep breath, I went in with him and met Jaris, Luna Isolde and Roderick in the conference hall.

Oh, for the love of the moon! Even Jaris' mother was here! I was truly cooked.

I studied Jaris' expression as I entered. Does he know the truth already? His face was as solid as granite. So,it was hard to tell.

My eyes fell on Roderick, and I gave him the death glare The asshole was smirking at me, having that look of 'I told you so.'

"Lyric, dear. It's a good thing you're here." Luna Isolde said, her voice firm. "Alpha Roderick claims to have some information he'd like to share."

A lump formed in my throat. I had to swallow really hard to take it down.

"Uh... Why don't we discuss this outside, Roderick?" I forced a nervous smile as I looked at him.

"No," Jaris interjected. "I want to hear what he has to say." He looked at Roderick. "Tell me."

I let my eyes stay on Roderick, sending him a silent plea. But the bastard actually smirked and shifted his gaze to Jaris.

"Lyric and I are bonded." Oh,no!

Luna Isolde gasped, confusion marring lines on her forehead.

I closed my eyes, embracing the darkness that was about to consume me.

"Five years ago, we were mates. Until she suddenly vanished, only to return now and get engaged to you.l was quite shocked when I learned you two were getting mated. Then, it dawned on me that she hadn't told you the truth. But it's kind of who she is. She'd do anything to get what she wants."

"Lyric, what's he talking about?" Luna Isolde asked, shock echoing in her tone. "You know you can't get mated to someone if you're still bonded to another. How can you do this!?"

Opening my eyes, they fell on Jaris who was giving me that very cold look. It sent shivers down my spine.

"It's notwhat you think," I whimpered, lowering my eyes to the floor.

"Please, Lyric; I wouldn't come all the way here to state a lie. Our ribbon is still intact at the temple! How could you do this to us!?" He shook his head, looking bittered. "You know, I tried talking her out of this. But she was too stubborn and wouldn't listen."

"That is not how it happened!"

"Then, tell us how it happened, Lyric. Explain yourself in a way that'd justify trying to have two men to yourselves!"

My throat was so tight, I thought I was going to cry.

"Tell us your story," It was Jaris.

A small gasp escaped me as I lifted my eyes to meet his. It was the first comment he was making. He wanted to hear from me.

"Roderick... and I used to be mated," the emotions flooded me as I forced the story out. "But during the time we were together, he treated me like a slave. In less than two years, he rejected me,because he'd already gotten what he wanted, which was power. He ended things with me and kicked me out. We'd have been through by now, but we're yet to complete the last step in the temple. Roderick kept pestering me to come back so we could finish the process and I could move on with my life. But when I did come, he suddenly refused to complete it. Instead," my eyes hardened as they looked at the monster."he wanted us to come back together.

"He wouldn't go to the temple with me. For weeks, my father and I had been trying to reach him so we could complete the process, but he's been proving stubborn." I dropped my eyes to the floor. "I didn't want to bother you with these details. But believe me, I wouldn't havegone through with the ceremony if I hadn't completely ended things with Roderick. My father and I were hoping we'd be able to get him to come around before the ceremony. I'm sorry." My voice cracked at the last word. Before I knew it, a tear was rolling down my cheek.

I sniffed as I wiped it off.

"Alpha Roderick, is that true?" Luna Isolde asked.

Roderick rolled his eyes. "Please, don't believe a word that girl says. She's really good at lying."

"Let's say she's good at lying," Jaris stood up, gentle and collected. "But did you two reject each other five years ago?"

Roderick frowned."Y-Yes.But-"

"So, the only step remaining is the ribbon at the temple?"

"Yes."

"Then, what're you waiting for?"

The room was silent for a while. Slipping his hand into his pocket, Jaris stepped down from the raised platform where he had been seated and walked toward Roderick.

"You see, Roderick," his voice was calm, his footsteps unhurried. "I don't really care what happened between you two in the past. Right now, Lyric and I are getting mated. I am really grateful you came here,because you just alerted me of a problem I had no idea existed. Right now, we're all going to the temple to cut the ribbon."
###Chapter 34
LYRIC

My chin hit the floor in utter surprise.

I couldn't take my eyes off Jaris. What in the name of the moon?

This was not the reaction I'd expected. I thought he'd call me names and everything ugly. But he was taking this better than I expected!

"What?" Roderick's voice sounded bewildered and shaken. "N...No. This is not the reason I came here.I came here to warn you about her. To tell you to kick her out!"

"So,you can have her?" Jaris huffed. "I'm afraid it doesn't work that way with me."

Roderick sprang to his feet, his gaze now contorted in fury.

"Well, I'm sorry too, but I have no intention of letting her go either."

The room turned ice cold.

What happened next was a blur-too fast for my mind to fully register. Jaris seized Roderick by the collar,and the first punch landed hard and sharp against his jaw.

I flinched.

Roderick struggled, but Jaris was already slamming him against the wall with brutal ease.

Good moon...

Roderick was strong-l had seen him in fights before. He could take down three men at once without breaking a sweat. But here? Against Jaris? He looked like a shadow against a towering oak.

It suddenly dawned on me what they say about Jaris being the most powerful Alpha. I was having a first hand experience of it. "Jaris!" Luna Isolde rose to her feet.

Jaris didn't stop. He delivered more blows and kicks to Roderick, then tossed him hard against a table. The table broke to the ground as he landed with a crash.

"Somebody, stop him!" The Luna barked at Kael and Nerion who were in the room. It was as if she was scared of interfering herself.

Kael and Nerion, however, still didn't make an attempt to stop Jaris.

Jaris reached for Roderick on the ground. His claws shot out, slashing across Roderick's chest. Blood bloomed through his shirt as he let out a low, guttural growl of pain.

Roderick was bleeding from the lips by now. He managed to get himself from the floor.

Jaris, retrieving a napkin from the back of his pocket, calmly wiped his hands. "You're going to the temple today,Roderick.Whether or not you like it." He turned to Kael and Nerion. "Bring him to the car."

I was utterly speechless as Kael and Nerion dragged Roderick to the car.Good moon! It looked like a movie!

If someone had told me that Jaris would do this for me, I never would've believed.

I forced my legs to move, going after them.

Roderick was forced into the backseat of the car, sitting next to Jaris who was obviously determined to hold him down.

"Come on, Lyric." Nerion urged, and I followed him into the second car.




I was in shock the whole time.

We reached the temple, met the Priestess, and I told her the reason we were there.

Roderick was already healing from his wounds. But the one Jaris had inflicted with his claws was still very fresh and looked painful. It should be healing by now as well. Were Jaris' claws poisonous? "Lyric, we can talk about this," the asshole said while we waited for the woman to return with our jar. "I know I messed up, but I only did this because I wanted you back. Please, forgive me and take me back."

I gave him a puzzled look. What an irony. Roderick Fletcher, begging me to give him a second chance.

I didn't reward him with even the sound of my voice. Instead, I glared really hard at him and looked away.

"Lyric-"

"Stop talking." It was Jaris, cutting him off in that terrifying tone of his.

Finally, the woman returned with our jar. Boldly in it were our names.

I remembered when Roderick and I had done this step in the temple. I'd been so happy that I was with someone despite being ugly. I had no idea that I was walking into hell.

Roderick was hell.

Opening the jar, the woman took out the ribbon.

"Are you sure about this? Have you two... sat and discussed this? You know, after it's broken, it can never be fixed." The woman asked with a dutiful concern.

That was one rule in our world. Once the ribbon was broken, the separated mates could never get back together. It was final.

"I'm sure," I said without reluctance. I hated Roderick with every fiber of my being.

"Sir?" The woman looked at Roderick who remained silent. "Your consent is very important in this, sir."

Shit. Please, don't tell me he'd mess this up.

Jaris extended his clawsas he stepped in front of him.

"I'l rip your heart out before you even blink. You have my word, Roderick. Do the right thing." Jaris was naturally intimidating.

I watched Roderick's jaw tighten. But I didn't think he had much of a choice. "I consent." He uttered the words with raw hatred.

Well,he could rot for all I care.

"Okay, them." The woman handed us a pair of tiny scissors next. "You're to cut it the same time when I give the signal.Are you ready?"

I nodded.

She closed her eyes and recited a prayer, calling on the gods of the moon to witness our separation.

"Now!" She urged.

Roderick and I placed the scissors and cut. The two halves dropped to the floor.

Instantly, I felt a heavy weight leave me. My head, my chest, my shoulders-everything about me felt lighter.

I was free!

"We're done here. Let's go." Jaris said and started for the door.

"Are you aware she doesn't have a wolf!?" Roderick yelled, bringing all of us to a halt.

No! The son of a bitch! How could he use this against me!?

When I was tortured with the silver iron at a young age, it made my wolf dormant. Roderick knew this but chose to throw it in my face?

To my surprise, Jaris chuckled. "I know." He continued toward the door.

Wait,what?

"You'll pay for this!" Roderick growled. "Mark my words, Jaris Dreadmoor. You'll pay for what you did today."

But Jaris didn't pay him a backward glance.

I was so happy I wanted to laugh. Roderick and I were finally over!

I chuckled at the asshole. "Goodbye, Roderick. I hope life treats you as badly you treated me." His stare was as a sharp as a knife. I turned away from him and left, catching up with Jaris outside.

"You're driving with me, Lyric," Jaris said without looking at me.

Oh.

He opened the front door and entered. He was actually the one driving.

Slightly nervous, I joined him in the front seat.

Kael and Nerion entered the second car.

So...Jaris wanted me to drive alone with him.

Warmth flooded my chest.

But...how did he know my wolf was dormant? And how come he didn't care?
###Chapter 35
LYRIC

Jaris started the car and kicked us into the road. Initially, I thought I was lucky, but it wasn't until that moment that I thought maybe, Jaris was trying to kill me for everything that just happened. Because why the hell was he going so fast!?

He was driving at an incredible speed, making all the buildings and people pass by in a blur.

I thought he was mad, but when I looked at him, I saw amusement in his metallic eyes. Then, it dawned on me that he was enjoying this, and he wasn't doing it because he was mad or wanted to punish me.

I laughed at some point, also enjoying the thrill of it. But I soon became worried from how dangerous it was.

"I-I think you might want to slow down," I stuttered when we'd narrowly missed a truck.

He glanced at me and smirked. "Are youafraid of dying, Lyric Harper?"

Goodness,he was enjoying this! But now, I wasn't so much.

He stepped on the gas pedal, making us go even faster. In a really dangerous way, he maneuvered trucks and cars. Horns blared angrily at us.

"The people are not finding this funny!" My voice rose a notch.

"Oh,Lyric Harper. Embrace the thrill sometimes and live."

The thrill.

I swallowed hard as I looked out the window.

I wouldn't deny; there was a part of me that found this really fun despite how scary it was. Living my life without a single fear....

A small smile touched my lips as I closed my eyes and allowed myself to enjoy the feel of the air from the window against my cheeks and my hair. It was exhilarating.

Jaris suddenly stopped on the brakes, making us bounce on our seats. My excitement vanished.

What in Hades?

I heard a low chuckle and looked at him to discover he was the one chucking. And he did that on purpose!

"That was scary," I said with a frown.

"I know. Thought I'd bring up a little scare to the fun."

I shook my head and ended up laughing.

Then, it dawned on me. Jaris and I were acting norma for the first time since I saw him in a few weeks. How did this happen?

Tonight, I could catch a glimpse of that fun man I'd met in a bar five years ago. A glimpse of that loving man that had taken me to bed.

'He abandoned you in the morning, Lyric, and had you kicked out.'

No. I shut the voice out. Tonight, I wasn't going to dwell on the past. I was going to embrace the present.

"Thank you," I said to him with a light smile.

He looked at me, his eyes probing.

"For helping with Roderick. And not judging meclarified.

He said nothing, simply shrugged, and stepped on the pedal.




MARTA

Marta hated that she was here at the moment, but she didn't have a choice when her grandmother had summoned her herself. She kept her head low as she entered her family's mansion. Fortunately, none of them were in the living room,except for the servants cleaning up the pace.

She took the stairs, heading to her grandmother's room.

Once upon a time, this mansion used to be full with so much fun. Now, it felt empty, sad, and bothersome.

She could perceive the smell of burning incense as she approached the door. Knocking twice,she made her way in and found her grandmother seated on the floor, various candles burning around her.

In front of her were books upon books and clump of herbs.

The woman's eyes were closed as she muttered some words.

Marta stood back with her head bowed. Her grandmother did not like to be interrupted when she was praying.

"Have you any idea how much of a disgrace you are?" The woman asked after a while, her eyes still closed."For six years, you only had one task: get Alpha Jaris to make you his Luna."

The woman opened her eyes, then slowly, turned aroundto meet her gaze. "How disappointing could you be,Marta? What exactly have you been doing?"

"I've been trying, grandma. I-I even gave him kids. I thought that would be enough to make him choose me.But-"

"Well, it's obvious you're not doing enough!" The woman snapped. "How can you be there and he's planning on making someone else his Luna? How useless can you be, Marta?"

Marta kept her head low, tears rimming her eyes. If it had been anyone else, she'd have spoken back at them.But not her grandmother. That would be her signing her death sentence.

"This family has gone down in shambles!" Her grandmother continued, turning away from her. "We all put our hopes in you, thinking you'd be able to help us out. But what did you do, Marta? You've obviously been there,enjoying the privilege that comes with being Jaris' baby mama, while you leave us here to rot!"
 
Marta frowned. "I'm sorry, Grandma. Believe me, I've been trying." "Then, try harder! See to it that the mating ceremony does not take place this Friday. If it does, we have lost,Marta! And you'll be useless to me."

****+****+

JARIS

After a long, exhilarating ride, Lyric and I arrived at Darkspire, and I could see how grateful she was that we arrived in one piece. He had been very scared during the whole ride, but I could also tell that a tiny part of her had enjoyed the thrill.

I could't exactly tell why I had the need to do this with her. I loved driving like 'that', but it was often alone.Yet tonight, I'd been tempted to do it with her.

I'll admit, I'd been shocked to know she was still bonded to Roderick. But it didn't take a genius to know Roderick was an asshole who was trying to manipulate things in his favour. When she said he'd treated her like a slave, I didn't have a hard time believing. Because then, it proved why she had this underlying fear in her eyes, like someone that was used to being hurt by others.

Roderick was lucky it was against the rules to kill another Alpha who didn't pose a serious threat to others.

She told me she wanted to check on the kids to make sure Xylon didn't have another epistle. I followed her.

We found one of the nannies at the door, and she confirmed that Xylon was fine throughout the day. Lyric still went into the room. So, I waited at the doorframe.

The blue lights were on in the room, so we could see how peacefully they slept.

I looked at Lyric in front of me and noticed she was staring too keenly at the kids. It was almost as if she was lost for a moment.

I heard a light sniffle, and my brows creased on their own.Was she... crying? No, that wasn't possible.

Her hand went over her face before she turned around.

"They're fine. I'll check on him again in the morning," I noticed her voice was a little hoarse this time. And her eyes... they were glossy.
Did my kids remind her of something?

Not saying another word, we left the room together.
###Chapter 36 
JARIS

I kept thinking about something else through the night.

Lyric had comprehensive knowledge in healing techniques. If she could heal Xylon, wouldn't she be able to heal me?

By morning, I'd made up my mind and sent for her in my Pack's office. I was running late as I had an important meeting at the company. But this was more important.

Lyric looked a bit surprised as she walked in.

"Did you sleep well?" I casually asked while scribbling down in my book.

"l uh...I did."

Good. Because you're about to hear some really shocking news.

"I called you here for a purpose. But first, you need to swear secrecy. What I'm about to say to you cannot be heard outside this room."

Her eyebrows knitted together in intrigue. "O...kay."

"Promise me it'll be confidential, Lyric. If word of this gets out, you'll hate what l'll do to you."

A smidge of irritation crossed her face. She didn't like being threatened.

Hmph. Her business.

"I promise. It stays between us." She responded.

Perfect. I dropped my pen and sat up.

"Since you seem to have a great knowledge on herbs and how to make people better, I figured you could provide some extra help. I have a problem that's been on for years. Like... a really long time." I interlocked my fingers. "When I'm in bed with a woman, I don't get to finish."

Lyric gasped, her eyes reflectng her shock.

I let her. She probably didn't expect me to say those words to her.

Her eyes dropped to her legs, crimson crawling to her cheeks.

"Do you think you can help?" I shrugged, hoping she was over the shock by now. We needed to move forward.

"I uh..." I watched her gulp. "I don't-I don't really..."

Damn it. "Can you form a sentence?" I snapped.

Her fingers started fiddling with the fabric of her shirt. She couldn't look me in the eye anymore. Why was she so ashamed when I was the one with the condition?

"I don't... really know. I've never treated anyone with this condition before." She stuttered the entire sentence.

"Have you treated anyone with Nexopathy before?"

She shook her head.

"But you were sure you could treat my son. So, why do you think you'll not be able to treat mine? Or are you being choosy,Lyric?"

"No! It's-It's not that."

"Okay. Is it because it has to do with my dick?"

Her eyes widened like saucers as they snappily met mine. Her mouth was wide open like a theater curtain.

I'd never seen Lyric Harper so shocked before.

What exactly was her problem? Had she never heard those words before? I was sure she wasn't a virgin. "Can you put a pause on the whole shock part and answer my question? Do you think you can treat me?"

I needed this to be done. I'd missed what it felt like to reach climnax. I'd missed that supreme feeling. The last time I got to enjoy it was five years ago, but unfortunately, mystery woman was nowhere to be found.

"I-I suppose," Lyric nervously cleared her throat. "Um.... for how long have you been experiencing this?"

"More than fifteen years."

She nodded. "And... what led to it?"

My thoughts turned murky. Okay, you're crossing the line, Lyric.

"How it came about is no business of yours. Just let me know if you can treat me or not."

She sighed, shakily. She still couldn't hold my gaze for long.

"I'll...think about it."

I scoffed. "You'll think about helping me?"

"No, not that. I mean, I'll have to think of the process and all. But don't worry, I'll get back to you this evening."

She looked really nervous now. Okay, she was hiding something. What're you hiding,Lyric Harper?

"I guess we're done here," I stood up. "Kael will be taking you shopping today for the ceremonial necessities. Remember, you have to be careful out there."

She nodded, then retrieved something from her back pocket. It was my black card.

"I made use of it yesterday. Thank you."

I scoffed as I grabbed my jacket from the arm of the chair.

"I didn't ask you to give it back. It's yours for now." I answered and I walked out first, knowing she'd follow when she was done being stunned.

LYRIC
It had to be a joke. Although, a part of me had seen this coming. From the very day I told him I could treat his son. But finally hearing it from him sounded like a nightmare.

I might have an idea that could work for him, but that'd require me touching him.... intimately.

Good Moon,the process was complex, and it definitely wasn't something I could do. Especially not with someone like him who had hurt me with that very 'thing' in the past.


....

Kael informed me when it was time to go shopping. I was quite sadthat I didn't have a female friend that could go with me. I knew it was necessary to have someone I could argue styles and colors with.

I'd have asked Jace to come along, but since Kael was the one taking me, I figured it was a bad idea.I wasn't in the mood to witness another world war.

Thankfully, the sales girls at the bridal shop we went through were quite friendly. They helped me make some decisions, and in the end, I got really pretty items, paying for them with Jaris' black card. I was still surprised he let me have it.

Well,the contract-privileges for a year.

When I returned to the Pack, I started thinking of an alternative way I could help Jaris. There was no way l was touching his...man organ to treat him.

I made some research and drove out to Botanical Bliss to get some herbs I hoped would suffice.

MARTA

She waited in the corner of the garden, looking around and wondering where the hell he was. What was he taking him so long?

She kept glancing at her watch. She had a surgery in less than an hour. She needed to leave.

Finally, he did come, walking casually like he didn't just keep her waiting for thirty minutes.
"Marta," Alpha Zarek called as he took his seat. "I must say I am quite surprised you asked me here."

"You kept me waiting. That is not so gentle of you." She tried and failed to hide the irritation in her voice.

"Well, I never said I was gentle. But I apologize." He reached for the glass of wine on her table, taking a sip."You said you could help me. What did you mean?"

Marta glanced around. There were the only ones in the garden. It was completely safe. "I heard you're on a little bet with Alpha Jaris."

Zarek rose his brow in surprise. "How did you know this?"

"My father was at the meeting. He overheard you two talking at the wine counter."

Zarek appeared thoughtful for a moment before he leaned back in his seat. "So... how do you think you can help?"

"Well... what if I said I could you help you be the winner?"

"Hold on," Zarek chuckled. "I know who your grandmother is, Marta. She's the great Priestess. So, I know you're in possession of some really strong potions and knowledge. But if there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I like playing fair. And I'd like to win this fairly."

Marta rolled her eyes. "I never said you weren't going to play fair. I was only offering some assistance.I could make the process of winning...faster."

Now, Zarek was intrigued. "So, what do you have for me?"
###Chapter 37
LYRIC

After long hours of research, I managed to come up with something I could substitute for Jaris. Although,there was no guarantee it would work, I was hoping it would.

It was evening when I finished making the tea and proceeded to his office to give it to him. It was insane that he was always working even when he was in the Pack. It made me wonder if he had any resting time at all.

I knocked repeatedly on the door of his office but got no response. Looked like he wasn't in. But I'd already told him I'd be bringing the tea later on. So, maybe I could just go in and leave this for him.

I went into the office and carefully placed the tea on the very messy-looking table. I wondered what he was always researching on that made his table always look like a warzone.

Well, I do hope that this tea gets to work a little. It'd save me a lot of embarrassment.

I was about turning away to leave when something else on the table caught my attention. It was a photo,turned upside down.

I had no business checking it out. I had no business wanting to know who it was. Yet, there was a stubborn pull between myself and the photo.

I chomped down on my lower lip and quickly, picked it up. Breath alipperr away from my lungs in that moment.

I gasped, wondering if my eyes were deceiving me.What in Hades!?

It was me. My old self; clearly from a CCTV footage.

My head swam with the information. It was from that day I'd been leaving his hotel. What was it doing here?Why did Jaris have it with him?

****
The new discovery gave me sleepless night and I kept wondering; should I tell Jaris the truth? That I was the same girl from the hotel? What difference would it make? He abandoned me. Wasn't it obvious he wanted nothing to do with me?

But why would he have my old picture with him? It didn't make any sense.



By morning, I was super nervous when he summoned me to his office. I wasn't sure I could see him right now, but I didn't have a choice.

I went in and found him talking with Kael and Nerion while busily arranging some files. I stood by the door and waited for some minutes until he finished with the two men and asked them to leave.

"Good morning." My head was dipped, my eyes on the floor.

"Lyric." His tone was abrupt. "I got the tea last night. But I didn't feel a thing when I took it. None of the reactions you said I'd get actually happened."

I bit my lip, still avoiding his gaze. "I um... I'm sorry.I thought it'd-"

"Are you sure it was your best you gave?" He asked me with those accessing eyes.

Uh...nope.Not even close to my best. It was just a random remedy that I was hoping would work.

"I'll come up with something else," I muttered.
ノ
There was a prolonged silence. It became uncomfortable I hadto look up at him. And there he was,watching me.

"What're you hiding from me?" He asked suspiciously. "It seems you know something else that can help but don't want to share."

I was tongue-tied. He finally suspected.

"Lyric Harper. Tell me the truth. You know I hate disobedience."

Ugh. But if I did, he'd want me to carry out the process on him!
Fine. I was fucked. I didn't have a choice.

"1-"

I was interrupted by his phone ringing. He received the call and frowned.

"How did this happen? Yes, I'll be there soon." He grabbed his jacket.

Oh,thank goodness.

I watched with relief as he started toward the door. Well, if it wasn't the most relieving moment of my life.

He ended the call and glanced at me. "We'll finish this when I get back." Then,he was out the door.

At least, we had hours until evening. It was enough time to prepare myself for what was to come.



Later in the day, when the kids got back from school, I made Xylon some of his tea and performed a therapy on him. By the time I finished, he was deep asleep on my thighs.

I smiled as Istared into his sleeping face. Xyla was busy, playing with her tab nearby and paid no attention to us.

Oh,cute things. As much as I loved them, my heart ached each time I saw them, because they reminded me of the ones I'd lost.

My own babies.

If only they were alive, they'd have been around the same age as Xylon and Xyla. I was sure they'd have been pretty too.

"Aunty, are you okay?" Xyla asked. It wasn't until that moment that I realized I'd been crying.

"I'm fine," I smiled, sniffed and wiped the lone tear.

**+****+

Jaris was still not back by evening. He must have a busy day at the company.
I was bored and decided I'd freshen up and take a walk.

I took my shower and took down my towel so I could apply some lotion. And in that very momnent, the craziest thing happened.

My door suddenly swung open, causing me to scream.

My hand reached for my towel on the bed, same time my eyes darted to the door to see who the hell had come in.I really hoped it was one of the maids.

But who was I kidding?

Because right there, standing in the doorway, brows drawn, was Jaris Dreadmoor.

No!
###Chapter 38
LYRIC

Every organ in my body tightened with rage. Clumsily, I managed to lock the towel around my body, but it felt useless.

I'd wasted enough time for him to see every inch of my naked body.

"What the hell!? Don't you knock!?" I said at the top of my voice, my fingers shaking as they weakly held the towel to my chest.

I didn't care that he was the Alpha I didn't want to piss anymore. Right now, I was fucking pissed!

Jaris just saw me naked without my consent! And it wouldn't have happened if he'd just knocked!

Or maybe it was my fault for not locking the door. No, how was I supposed to know that someone like him would want to come in without knocking?

Jaris looked stunned. Too stunned. I'd never seen him this way before. Didn't even think I'd was possible.

His eyes, slowly, raked over me, stopping at my legs. It became uncomfortable.

"I apologize." He finally muttered, stepped out of the room and slammed the door.

****+****+


JARIS

What in the name of the moon?

Maybe I was wrong for going in without knocking. I didn't even know what I was thinking.

But I guess I thought that the odds of finding Lyric naked would be quite low.

How I got in wasn't exactly the biggest problem for me. I was more concerned about the fact that seeing her naked brought about a certain reaction; one I did not expect.

A shiver has traveled all the way through my chest, down to my abdomen, and finally to my groin. It looked like the most beautiful body I'd ever seen.

I couldn't explain it, but I wanted to see more of it. I was as hard as a rock already. How did it have that much effect on me?

The air suddenly felt hotter.

Reaching my office, I took off my tie immediately and groaned as I undid my buttons. Why was I suddenly uncomfortable?

A rapid knock reached my door.

"Who is it?" I rasped.

"It's Lyric!" She sounded really pissed.

Damn it. I couldn't see her now.

"I'm not seeing anyone!" My voice was grumpier than I intended.

"Well, I need to talk to you!"

I said nothing, and to my shock, she fucking opened the door and let herself in.

"What do you think you're doing?" I snarled.

She was wearing brown flannel pants and a plain black top now. Her hair was still wet, reminding me of what I'd seen earlier.

No. She couldn't be here. I couldn't see her. Maybe, I could get Kael to come throw her out.

"What you did was wrong! How could you just come into my room without knocking?" Her eyes were ruddy.Oh, she wasn't just angry, she was ashamed that I'd seen her little decency.

"I already apologized.What the fuck do you want me to do? Go back in time and erase the memory?" "Yes! If that's possible."

"Lyric,get ouut. I can't deal with you right now!" I randomly grabbed some papers from the table.

I'd never been this decomposed my whole life.

"I'm just here to tell you to be more careful. You don't just barge into people's rooms when they could be having a private moment."

"Well, maybe you should've locked your door. Have you considered that?"

"What? You can't blame me for not locking my own door. Don't try to put this on me!"

"Damn it, Lyric! Just go!" I snapped, throwing the papers in my hands all around the room.

She flinched, her eyes glossy with tears and fear. Well, I couldn't bring myself to care right now.

Finally-thank goodness-she stormed out of the office.

A while later, I picked up my tie and proceeded to my room.

Something was wrong with me. Terribly wrong.

I needed a shower.

But as the warm water cascaded down my body, all I could think of was the image of Lyric Harper, naked in her room. I could vividly remember what every curve of hers looked like-how stunning her legs were, how round and full her breasts were, and how shocked she had been.

I hated that I was doing it. I'd seen a lot of naked women in my life, yet getting a glimpse of Lyric today made me react in ways I never thought was possible.

I stared down at myself in the shower. I was as hard as rock. Painfully hard.

My brows gathered in a frown as I ground my teeth.

Don't do it, Jaris. Don't do it.

But my subconsciousness was deaf. Against my actual will, I took my hand to my erection, jerking it. I hissed at the rush of emotions, my blood seeming to run faster.

The image filled my head, and my hand worked faster.

Naked. Artful breasts. Slightly bushy but beautiful-looking cunt. Slender waist.

I groaned low in my throat as I reached that very point I'd been craving for years. That very paradise I'd missed.

I came very hard, my release fillingmy hand and dropping to the floor.

Damn it!

My eyes went close as my head lifted up in ecstasy.

It took me a whole minute to get over the wave. And when it was finally over, and my sanity had returned, it dawned on me that I'd just cum to the image of Lyric Harper.
###Chapter 39 
LYRIC

For two days, I avoided Jaris like a plaque. And I think he was doing the same.

I know we've both been intimate before. But that was five years ago! When I was a very different person,right before he abandoned me.

This body is very special now. He couldn't just look at it when he wanted.

"Congratulations, aunty," Xylon said with a sweet smile as I massaged his sister's scalp on the bed.

"For what,honey?"

"The mating ceremony tomorrow. We know you'll become daddy's Luna," Xyla answered.

Oh."Thank you."

Actually, I'd been quite nervous about that. Jaris and I would finally be mated tomorrow, only to be broken apart after a year.

But I was still more concerned about the fact we were only going to be together for a year. While it'd help my father clear his debts, I still didn't understand what Jaris would be getting out of this.

Someone knocked on the door. It was the children's nanny, followed by Jaris who stood before her.

Oh,damn it.

I got goosebumps instantly, my throat running dry.

"Uh... we'll continue our session later, dear," Isaid sweetly to Xyla as I lifted her head off my thighs.

"Bye,aunty."

I made for the door, and my heart skipped a beat as I got closer to Jaris. I dipped my head, but I could feel his eyes on me. As soon as I had gone past him, I hastened my steps.




I was relieved when I got to the room, but that relief was short-lived as a while later, Kael came over to inform me that Jaris was calling for me.

What? No way.

I paced restlessly in my room, trying to come up with the best way to avoid him. I took too long, and when l heard a knock on my door, I was startled.

Inhaling for courage, I went ahead to open the door. My breath lunged in my throat when I came face to face with the devil, in this case.

I swallowed around the lump in my throat. "Good evening, Alpha."

"I knocked." He slipped one hand into his pocket. "I hope you noticed."

If I wasn't so nervous, perhaps I'd have scoffed.

"I sent for you thirty minutes ago. I thought I'd find you busier."

I felt reprimanded. "I'm sorry. I was just about to be on my way."

"Hm." His eyes raked over me. "Doesn't look like it."

Ugh.What was he doing here? I wanted the ground to open and swallow me whole.

"Anyway, I stopped by to know how preparations for tomorrow's going."

Oh. Jaris stopped by to check on me? What a surprise in this peculiar domain!

"It's... It's going just fine. My friend will actually be coming over."

"Jace?"

"Yeah."
He seemed to give it some thought. Well, he should know by now that Jace was no threat. He was my bestfriend; that's all. Plus, I didn't have any female friends.

"If he'll be helpful," he shrugged.

My heart just got lighter. Hm. Why was Jaris Dreadmoor being so sweet today?

"Take care, then." He tipped his head and left.

I returned to my room, feeling on edge.

Would it be wrong to tell Jaris I was the lady from five years ago? What if he'd been looking for me,considering the fact that he had my picture with him?

I was damn nervous. But a part of me was pushed to actually do this.

My phone came awake on the bed. When I checked, it turned out to be a strange caller.

"Hello?" I answered it.

"Lyric.It's Marta."

Oh. My head slumped.

Hold on, Marta!? Why in the moon would Marta be calling me?

"Hi. Is there a problem?" I tucked some strands of hair behind my ear.

"That depends. I need us to meet up. Right now. It's kind of important."



In less than an hour, I met up with Marta at the garden she requested. The corner where we sat was private with just the two of us.

"Why did you call for me?" I asked as I watched the waiter open our drinks on the table and poured it into two glasses.

Marta looked worried. It was a rare sight.
"I'm just worried about my kids."

O...kay.

The waiter left, and she picked up her glass from where she took a sip. Done, he carefully placed it back on the table.

"I don't really know who you are. And it's the first time that Jaris is entrusting someone to this extent with Xylon's health. What makes you think you can actually heal him?"

She didn't ask the question like it was one of her usual word-battles. She asked it like she was truly concerned.

Hm. That was a first, coming from someone like Marta.

"Well, I won't call myself perfect. No one's perfect. But I do think I possess certain knowledge on medicine.I mean well for Xylon. I mean, he's just a little boy who doesn't deserve to go through that amount of pain. All I want to do is help him."

She drank from her glass again. "But how do you happen to possess such knowledge? Where did you study?"

I stared down at the table."It's.... It's a long story. Let's jst let go of the story."

She drank from her glass again. I noticed I hadn't even drank from mine yet.

I reached for my own glass and took a sip. Hm. Now I understand why Marta couldn't stop drinking from hers.

"I'm just trying to be a careful mother, Lyric. Initially, a part of me had thought you were pretending to care for my son so you could please Jaris. I was even worried that you might have an ulterior motif. That is the reason you see me being harsh each time I seeyou near the kids."

I chuckled. "They're poor kids. I could never do anything to hurt them."

Marta nodded. She was about sipping from her glass again when her hand shook and the crimson wine spilled on her dress. Oh, damn.

"Wow. Sorry about that," I shook my head.

The dress was ruined.

"Clumsy me!" She hissed, dabbing it with the back of her hand.

She rose to her feet. "I need to take care of this. I'll be back."

I watched her leave, heading to the restroom.

Hm. Who could've thought she could be this nice?

First, it was Jaris being nice to me. Now, it was Marta. Looks like Selene is finally on my side.

I chuckled and tried to drink from my glass again, only to realize it was empty. What!? How did I finish this without knowing!?

It was too good. I'd probably ask for the name before I left.

I felt tired. Of course, I should be. I'd been working tirelessly for the past two days because of the ceremony tomorrow.

My mating ceremony with Jaris Dreadmoor.

A smile touched my lips as I relaxed my head on the table.

I'd be getting mated to him tomorrow. My Jaris.My love.

I giggled. Images of him filled my head instantly; images from years ago. He gave me the best night of my life. And now, there was a possibility we could have more of such nights.

Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to be mated to Jaris, even if it was for a year.

Right now, something strange was happening to me. I wanted him. Only Jaris.

"Lyric?" I heard his voice.

Huh? Jaris was here?
Lifting my head, I saw him standing in front of me, looking dashing in a black suit.

"Jaris?" My head was lightweight, my voice sounding distant to my own ears.

He smiled and extended his hand to me, and I took it. He was real. Jaris was here.

"Wh-What're you doing here?" I shook my head.

Every other thing around him was blurry in my sight. The only image I could clearly see was his. But it didn't matter. The only person I wanted to see was him.

"I came to get you.Come."

He pulled me to my feet and started leading me toward the back.

Ugh! My head felt so heavy. Where was he even taking me?

I didn't need to ask. I trusted Jaris.

We continued walking until we reached a room, just behind where Marta and I had been sitting.

Oh. I had no idea there was a room here. It even had a bed in it.

Jaris pushed me to the wall, his hands on my waist.

By the moon, he was so hot. He could be mine.

There was a burning desire inside me. I couldn't think, I just acted. I put my arms around him and kissed him first, kissing him like an insane woman who had been starving for days.

****+

I woke up with my head on the table. My neck and waist hurt. My head felt like a party had happened in it.

I groaned as I sat up. What a heck of a dream I just had.

I shook my head. Why was I so aroused for Jaris? So aroused to the point that I'd slept with him?

I touched my lips. The dream had felt real. Glancing behind me, I found the room.Oh.

I stood up and approached it, but it was locked.

I sighed. Of course, it was locked. It was all a dream.

A stupid dream at that.

And we ended up not even getting intimate in the dream. I'd been about to undress when he suddenly stopped me. That was all I could remember before I woke up from the 'nightmare'.

Returning to the table, I noticed that Marta's bag was gone.

Huh? Why would she leave me here alone?

I scowled as I took my bag and also left.
###Chapter 40
LYRIC

Jace was at the Pack house when I arrived.

I told him about the weird dream, and he only made fun of me.

We sought out my jewelry and every other thing I'd be needing for the ceremony tomorrow.

Later at night, I went to Jaris' office. I still felt like telling him the truth about five years ago. I was eager to see his reaction and know what he'd say concerning why he left that morning.

To my surprise, his office was locked. When I checked his room, it was locked as well.

Hm. That was strange. Normally, he'd be back by now.

I was headed back to my room and conveniently bumped into Marta.

"You left without telling me. I was there, asleep on the table." I told her.

She was just as dressed as she'd been at the garden.

She shrugged unapologetically. "I had to take care of something. And I didn't want to wake you."

Okay.There was the mean Marta I knew.

Before I could say anything else, she walked away.


·····

It was the day we'd all been waiting for. The day that had kept me on my toes.

The ceremony wasn't until evening, and by noon, some stylists were already present to attend to me.

They worked on my hair, which took longer than I'd have wanted. They kept it up in clips while the makeup artists worked on my face.

"You're about to become a beauty queen, Lyric. Literally," Jace said, eating from a can of chips on the bed.

My mind drifted to Jaris. If he did return last night, it must've been when I was already asleep, which was quite late.

I'd stayed up late, waiting and wondering where he went and what was taking him so long to return.

Even this morning, I'd gone to check on him but still couldn't find him. I ran into Nerion and asked if everything was fine with him. Nerion simply told me not to worry about him.

I decided to let him be, concluding he was possibly doing some men stuff or something.

By evening, I was dressed in my long, red floral dress.

It was the prettiest dress I'd ever laid eyes on, which had cost a fortune the day I was getting it.

My hair was curled and fell over my shoulders. My makeup was dark themed but just perfect. I'd never seen myself more beautiful before.

"Damn, Lyric! Damn!" Jace shook his head.

I blushed, but deep down, I was so nervous.

Jace held my hand as he led me out of the room, outside to where thecars were waiting.

The drive to the temple was almost an hour. It was dark already.

My father was waiting outside when we arrived. He helped me from the car, put his hand around mine and led me into the temple.

Wow. My father looked good. And very happy.

Entering into the temple with the red bouquet in my hand, I was surprised to find a lot of people already seated. The hall was filled to the brim.

Wow. 
I was able to recognize some faces from my father's pack and some from Darkspire. Even Luna Isolde was there already. As well as Marta. They were in the front row.

This was real. It was happening.

'Don't get too excited, Lyric. It's only for a year' that ugly voice reminded me.

I pushed it aside, not wanting it to ruin this special day for me.

The Priestess was already waiting at the end of the aisle. Father dropped me in front of her before returning to his own seat which was also in the front row.

Then,we all waited for Jaris to arrive. He should be here any minute.




The clock kept ticking.

We were all waiting.

But some of the guests were starting to get impatient.

It's been over an hour and Jaris was still not here. My waist started to hurt from standing for so long I was asked to take a seat.

"Do you think he's changed his mind? A man shouldn't be this late to his mating ceremony," I heard someone ask from behind.

"I really don't know. I believe he should've been here by now if he wanted this to happen." someone replied.

My heart ached, a sharp painful feeling. Was I being abandoned again?

My fingers shook around the bouquet I held. Father, seated next to me, held my hand.

"He'll be here. Don't worry."

But an extra hour later, he still wasn't here.

The guests were already leaving. My heart was crumbling. No. This had to be a nightmare.

An additional hour later, he still hadn't come. I had already lost my mind.

The people left in the hall were not even up to ten. From hundreds of people that had initially been here.

Luna Isolde had been trying to reach him, but he wouldn't take his calls. When she called his beta, Kael said he didn't want to talk to anyone and didn't want anyone to know where he was.

It dawned on me. I was being abandoned again. I was being rejected.

The realization struck me in the chest, and that pain traveled all the way to my eyes in the form of tears.I couldn't hold them back. They fell onto my cheeks, ruining my perfect makeup.

"Lyric," father called with pity in his voice.

He pulled me into his chest for a hug, and there I wept bitterly, knowing I'd been rejected again. Abandoned twice by the same man.
###Chapter 41 
LYRIC

"Why would he do this to me?" I whimpered against father's chest. "I thought we had a deal. I thought he wanted this."

The humiliation was crippling. Twice, I tried to end this deal, but he wouldn't let me. Did he only push it this far just to humiliate me? Was I cursed?

"Jaris?" I heard Luna Isolde call.

Sniffling, I lifted my face off father's chest for a look, and there he was, striding into the hall with a look of cold detachment.

My face remained pale as I watched him. He did come. After three excruciating hours? After all the guests had left!

"Jaris, where have you been?" Luna Isolde asked in a cutting whisper when he reached her side. But Jaris walked past her without sparing her a glance.

He didn't spare me a glance either as he walked down the aisle, stopping in front of the altar.

The Priestess must have been informed of his arrival, because she stepped out again, taking her place at the altar.

I'd stopped whimpering, but my tears were still flowing.Was this a joke?

"Lyric Harper.Please," The Priestess pointed to the spot where I was to stand before Jaris.

But my body wasstone cold. I could hardly even blink.

"Lyric. Come on." Father stood up, pulling me along with him.

I didn't even have the strength to take my bouquet along. It was a miracle I was able to walk without falling. My makeup was already ruined by my tears, no doubt.

Everything was ruined!

I was taken to the altar to stand before Jaris. His face was stone cold, like the part of him I despised. He wouldn't even look at me. At that point, he looked like he'd rather be listening to the sound of nails scraping against a chalkboard than be here with me.

"What happened?" My voice was barely above a whisper, the pain still evident. "We've been waiting...for three hours."

He still wouldn't look at me. The expression on his face terrified me, just as much as it wounded me. What was wrong with him!?

My lips quivered as I glared at him. He hurt me. Abandoned me. Yet he had the nerves to stand here and act all grumpy!? Oh,really?

It was even more painful that I couldn't do anything about it. He was the only one with the right to terminate the contract. All I could do was stand her and take all the bullshit he offered.

The Priestess started the process.

I dropped my teary gaze to the floor, praying for the strength not to break down in front of him. But who was I kidding? I was already a weeping mess.

After a long procedure and proclamations, Jaris and I were mated.

She retrieved a jar of ribbon and guided us into knotting it.

"Congratulations,Jaris Dreadmoor and Lyric Dreadmoor.Henceforth, you are both one."

The very few people in the hall clapped. But even I could notice how sad it was.

Who would've thought that this very day that I looked up to would turn out to be the worst day of my life?



"You have to say something!" I said in a near-cry as I ran after Jaris who had stormed out of the hall as soon as the Priestess joined us.

"You can't just leave like nothing happened!"

He stopped walking, taking a while longer than necessary to turn to me.

His eyes were so cold, devoid of any warmth or affection. I couldn't see the man that had made me blush in the last couple of days.

"Let's get one thing straight, Lyric Harper," he started toward me, so intimidating. I stood my ground, forcing myself not to retreat. "I only came here 'cause you're a necessity. Because I need you for something. But know this-you're to stay as far away from me as possible. I'll have nothing to do with you. And hopefully, the year runs quickly so we can put an end to this."

What? Tears streaked my cheeks.

"How can you say this?" I asked when he turned around. "I thought we were... I thought we were good." My voice broke at the last word.

I hadn't felt pain this deep in a long time.

He looked at me again,his eyes not any warmer.

"I should've known you were all the same." He stared down at me in a degrading manner.

What did that mean by that? What in hell did I do?

"Stay away from me." He added and left, going into his car.

I remained there, sobs wracking my shoulders as I watched the car drive off.

He was gone. He hated me. But what exactly did I do to deserve this?

"Hey, Lyric." Jace tapped me from behind.

I turned and fell into his arms, letting my tears run free. "I didn't do anything. I don't deserve this."

"Sshh. It's okay. It's fine." He cooed, stroking my hair. MARTA

Marta kept looking around as she met with Zarek a short distance from the temple.

"How can you come here? What if someone sees us?" She asked with a snarl, her eyes darting around.

"Well, that would be your problem, not mine. If you hadn'tignored my calls earlier, I wouldn't be here," Alpha Zarek gritted the words. He was pissed. "What happened? I told you I loved playing fair!"

Marta rolled her eyes. "Well, it was fair, wasn't it? She willingly followed you to the room."

"Yet, she kept moaning the name of another! She thought I was Jaris. Can you explain that?"

"Please, I'm really not in the mood for this. You got what you wanted. As for me, I'm the one at a loss here because they still got mated!"

Zarek roughly seized her wrist, making it hurt.

"What're you doing? Let me go!"

They were in the dark. No one could see them.

"You ruined my plans, you know that? I wanted her to fall for me. That was how I wanted to win the game!When you told me you could help, I thought you had something good up your sleeves. You told me you wouldn't use any of your grandmother's..."

"No. I told you I was only going to help you play fair. She willingly kissed you and went along with you.What game can be fairer than that?"

Zarek released her hand, but the rage in his eyes remained.

He felt deceived. The potion was meant to hypnotize and make her see the face of the man she loved. He was a bit surprised that Lyric loved Jaris that much.

"At least, tell me you slept with her. Give me something good to help with this mood," Marta said with pain in her eyes. "You're sick if you think l'd sleep with a woman while she's moaning the name of another."

"Ugh!" She grunted in frustration. "I hate this! I shouldn't have helped you if I had known, since you're so ungrateful." She stepped toward him, meeting his gaze with defiance. "This should be the last time you contact me. You and I, our business is over. Don't get me in trouble because, well, you'd be in trouble too."

She turned on her hell and walked away, fury bubbling within her core.

In the end, she failed. Lyric and Jaris still got mated. Her grandmother was going to kill her.
###Chapter 42
JARIS

I was on my sixth bottle.

It was infuriating because I hated drinking this much. I was always in control of how much alcohol I took into my system, but tonight, I wanted it all.

I stayed in my office for hours, replaying everything in my head. Drinking made me feel slightly better.

Nerion came in to remind me that it was too late and I probably should get some sleep.

Ugh. The good guy. It was in such situations that I missed Kael. He'd have drunk with me, knowing I needed the sensation.

Unfortunately, he was out, executing a task.

But Nerion was right. I was tired and could use some sleep.

I left the office for my room, and right there, on the bed was Marta.

She was wearing a red transparent night dress. I could see the small red bra she had on, and the small red pant. The dress was as good as useless because it was a see-through.

Her hair was stretched and packed to one side, a red color tinting her lips. Right there, she looked like a seductress.

"Fuck, Marta. What did I tell you?" My voice was less critical.

"I'm sorry," she said in a rather seducing tone as she slowly sat up, her both hands on the bed beside her waist. "I have been waiting for quite a while."

My head was a little woozy. All I wanted to do was get off this stupid suit and crash into the bed.

Facing my dresser, I took off my jacket and started undoing the buttons of my black shirt. Marta stood up. "I was worried and wanted to check on you." She walked toward me, taking slow, enticing steps. "I don't really know what happened, but l know you're not someone who acts out without a reason.I need you to know I'm here, and I'm sorry for what happened."

Her face came into view in the mirror. She was standing behind me, watching me.

I kept my eyes on her as I took off my tie, tossed it to the bed, then took off my unbuttoned shirt next.

"Everything will be fine," she added in hushed tones, placing her hand on my shoulder. My bare shoulder.

Angry desire flooded me.

Without hesitating, I spun and grabbed her, pulling her in and locking my lips on hers. She threw her arms around me, returning the kiss better than I was.

I turned us around so her back was against the dresser. My hand angrily fisted her hair.

I needed to take this out on someone.

Yet, as I held and kissed Marta, all I got were forbidden images in my head.

Wet hair. Unclothed body. Full breasts. Hot legs.

The memory sent a painful message to my cock.

Marta was not her. They were not the same.

With a hard shove,I peeled myself away from Marta. She was confused and hurt.

"Jaris..."

"Get out." I turned away from her, my head banging.

She came closer. "Is there..."

"I told you to leave!" I snarled at her, my iris flashing red.

Fuck.What the hell? That was my wolf, wanting her gone as well.

It was strange.

Marta recoiled in horror. But she didn't waste any further time. She hurriedly left the room.

I took a deep breath, holding onto the dresser for support.

Gaining a little composure, I pulled out the phone from my pocket and sat on the bed as I replayed the video.

She was there, holding and kissing Zarek.

She looked so horny. So desperate for him.

Anger and irritation flooded me.

I thought she was different. She had this beautiful smile, pretty face, and a smart mouth. And the way she cared for my kids. I didn't think someone like her would be so cheap.

Zarek's text was lying just below the video. 'Told you I could get her in a week. She's quite cheap-just like Chloe.

My anger returned in a greater fold. I groaned and thrashed the phone against the wall.

She made a mockery of me. In a way I'd never been mocked before! How dare she!?

I rubbed the heels of my palms against my eyes.

When I was calmer, I reached for the picture in my pocket and breathed in relief. Finally, something to keep me sane.

I ran my fingers along the surface of the picture. My heart ached, just as much as it calmed at the sight of her.

I never believed in love at first sight, until I met her.

"I wish you were here. It'd have made a lot of difference," I mumbled, staring wistfully at the image. LYRIC

For four days, I was indoors.

The only people I got to see were the maids who brought me my meals, and Xylon and Xyla who came to check on me.

They didn't know what was going on. They were just surprised that I hadn't come to see them the whole time.

I was too ashamed to go out, ashamed to face the people.

I imagined what the rumours would be:

"The Alpha left her standing at the altar until all the guests got tired and left."

"I think he almost changed his mind, which is the reason he must have arrived late."

"It's really sad. A lady as pretty as her almost being rejected."

However,by the fifth day, I was done feeling embarrassed and came out of my shell.

Today,I had something important to do.

I found something corporate to wear and kept my eyes low as I walked to my car.

I wanted to be strong enough to ignore what people thought about me, but it was difficult being in my shoes.Every eye felt judgy at this point.

I was so relieved when I got into my car, and was even more pleased that the windows were tinted. At least,they won't get to see me anymore.

Driving, I received a call from the manager of the garden Marta and I had used that night. It brought me more relief.

"Yes?" I put the call on handsfree.

"Good morning,Mrs.Dreadmoor. I'm calling in respect to your request. We've finally gotten the approval to give you the CCTV footage you requested."

My eyes widened in a relieved surprise. "Really?"

"Yes. And you were right. Someone else had entered into the garden that night."
###Chapter 43
A heavy lump formed in my throat.

"I'll just forward the footage to you."

"Okay. Thank you.So much."

The call ended.

I inhaled nervously.

While I was hurting, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something might've happened to me that night.Something I did not remember.

I eagerly waited for the footage, but the manager appeared to be slow, and until I reached my destination,the footage did not come.

I stared at the tall building in front of me.

Ugh. Was I making the right decision?

Yes.

Grabbing my bag and file, I stepped out of the car, into TCH.

The place was bright and busy.

Large,glass windows lined one wall, allowing natural light to flood the space. Colorful artwork adorned the walls, providing small bursts of warmth amid the clinical atmosphere.

The reception desk buzzed with activity as calls were answered and visitors were directed.

Sitting in the reception, I put a call through to the woman I was supposed to meet. I told her I was there, and in a few minutes, she joined me. When I told father about my plan, he gave me her contact, saying she was an old friend and would link me up.

"Good morning, ma'am." I greeted her as I stood with my bag.

"Lyric, dear. How're you doing?"

"I'm fine."

She accessed me. "The name is Helen. Congratulations, on becoming the Luna of Darkspire."

I bit my lip as I lowered my eyes.

What I should be getting was sympathy, not congrats.

She led into the elevator where we went up to the fourth floor.

"Your father tells me you're quite good at what you do" Helen said as we walked down the corridor.

"Yes. And I love helping people." I was a little distracted by the glimpse of sick people I saw through the windows.

"Then, I believe you'll be of great help here." We stopped in front of a door. "She is the head of this department. I already told her you were coming and put in a good word for you. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll get this." She winked at me.

Knocking once on the door, she' opened the door to a familiar face behind the desk. I froze for a moment as l locked eyes with Marta.

Huh? She was the head of this department?

"Hello,Marta. She's the lady I told you about," Helen introduced, stepping into the room ahead of me.

"Oh." Marta seemed surprised. Then displeased.

Forcing my legs to move, I made my way into the office, my fingers fiddling with the strap of my bag.

Helen winked at me and left. "Lyric." Marta's voice held no warmth. "Take a seat."

I did.

Glancing at her, a bitter memory from that night resurfaced, reopening healing wounds.

Four nights ago, on the night Jaris and I had mated, I hadI been heading to his room to see if I could get an answer from him. Then, I found Marta leaving.

She was wearing a red revealing dress, trying to straighten her ruffled hair. I didn't need anyone to tell me those lips had been kissed. And when saw me, she had worn a triumphant smile.

I was beyond wounded. I couldn't believe that Jaris had slept with her on a night like that. I understood that we were not supposed to have any form of romance, but how could he disrespect our bond like that?

"You want to work here?" Marta asked, pulling me out of my painful trance.

I swallowed the lump in my throat, forcing my composure on. "Yes."

"Why?"

I scoffed. "What do you mean 'why?' Why do doctors work here?"

Her expression turned rigid. "I am interviewing you, Lyric. So, I'd suggest you watch your words."

Right. I suppressed the urge to roll my eyes. "I want to work here because I want to help people, as much as I can."

Her gaze lingered on me before she lowered them to my file. She frowned. "You haven't worked in a hospital before?"

The question made me a little edgy. "Um....I have. I just... I didn't get to have it on my resume."

"Why's that? Were you kicked out or what?"

I didn't give an answer.

"Where was this?"

 Oh, no. I couldn't answer that. Nobody could ever know where it was or what I had done there.

"I'm sorry, I can't answer that." I lowered my eyes to my legs.

I didn't need to look up at her to know she was displeased.

"Well, I guess I'm also sorry," she closed my file, sliding it to me. "But we don't accept amateurs here in TCh.So,I can't accept you."
###Chapter 44
LYRIC

"How can you even say that?" I scoffed with disbelief. "I've been treating your son. You've seen how good I am."

"I've seen you perform little tricks and don't even know the source of your knowledge."

"Little tricks? I've done things you or no one else has been able to do in years. You can't just make a mockery of that."

Her eyes turned colder. "I told you no! These are the standards of TCH. It's not like I put them in place. So,why don't you take that and leave?"

My hands balled into fists. How could I be rejected so easily?

Marta was nothing like the woman that had called me to the garden and spoke 'peace'. Now, she acted as if that night never happened.

"I was hoping you'd give me a try, at least." I pressed. "It's unreasonable to just dismiss me without seeing my potential. And you of all people know my potential. You know what I can do."

She rolled her eyes and picked up another file. "For acquaintance's sake, don't tell me l'Il have to throw you out of here."

Suddenly, the door swung open, revealing an anxious nurse. "Ma'am, we have an emergency!"

I followed Marta and the nurse out of the office.

"It's the only son of a beta. He was involved in an accident where a vital organ was affected. He doesn't have a wolf yet, so we're afraid we might lose him," the nurse briefed Marta as they hurried to the emergency ward.

I went there with them, and my heart shattered at the sight before me. His throat was torn open, making him struggle for air.

He also had big open wounds on his stomach and other parts of his body. The boy was wailing and writhing on the bed, and I didn't want to imagine how painful it must be for him.

Marta rushed in and joined the others that had been holding him down.

"Get me a saline IV and prepare for immediate intubation!" She demanded.

That familiar feeling hit me. Instantly, I knew the quickest solution to his problem.

I went into the ward to meet Marta. "Create a hole by the side of his neck and put a tube to secure it."

She glared at me while keeping her hands busy. "What're you saying!? That's a-dangerous spot. He'll die immediately!"

"No. Trust me. Just do it! Or... Or at least, let me touch him." I felt if I could do it myself, it'd go a long way in making him better.

Marta ignored me.

Damn it.

"Just do it! He's dying!"

"Shut up and get out, Lyric! I know what I'm doing!" She snarled at me.

Anger surged through my veins in an instant.

"I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave, ma'am. This is restricted to only staff,"a nurse walked up to me and said.

I glared hard at Marta who was no longer staring at me, then stormed out of the ward. But I remained there by the door, watching, my blood seething.

Why was she so stubborn? That was the only thing that would help the boy. I could see it.

They all worked hard, giving him the IV and all. But it wasn't helping. And a few minutes later, the boy stopped writhing. He stopped crying.

He was dead.

A bomb went off in my bed, shattering the remnants of my heart, and I couldn't stop the tears that rolled down.

Marta tried using an AED to revive him, but it was as useless as her earlier attempts.

Their faces were filled with sorrow as they covered him up with a linen.

"Time of death. Eleven a.m," Marta announced.

There was another doctor coming beside me. I didn't even spare her a glance as I stormed into the ward.

"I told you to make that hole. You could've saved him!" I yelled.

"Oh, please shut up. Creating that good would've been deadlier. Stop trying to act like the savior all the time." She snapped back.

Oh,damn it.I wanted to hit her in the face.

"You're just selfish! And egoistic! Admit it, Marta! You didn't want anyone else seeing what I can do. You put your selfish interest above that little boy's life when you could've healed him!"

"Have you lost your mind? I am the head of this department. That has only happened because I'm quite good with my job."

"Well,obviously, you're not that experienced. Tell me, how many lives have you lost in the past month?"

She looked past me, like she was staring at someone, and I could see her fighting her fury.

"You're not perfect! It doesn't hurt to get a little help sometimes," I added angrily.

I heard the footsteps of someone entering the room and spun around to see an elderly woman before us,wearing a lab coat.

She accessed me. "Who are you?" She shifted her gaze to Marta, then the boy at the bed.

"How're you so certain that the tube in his hole would ve saved him?" She asked me.

That was the problem. i couldn't explain how I knew. "l just know.

"Hm." She gave me a head to toe stare""And what're you doing here exactly?"

I handed my file to her. "I came to apply to be a doctor here. But Marta was just kicking me out before the incident."

The woman looked at Marta with surprise in her eyes while holding my file. "You were dismissing an applicant without bringing her to me?"

I watched Marta's face pale. "She....she doesn't have any experience. I thought it'd be a waste of time."

"I thought we've already established the fact that every applicant must go through me, whether accepted or rejected. Your only job is to do the first assessment, Ms Monroe. You have no right to just dismiss people without my knowledge."

Marta dropped her gaze to the floor, shame coloring her cheeks. I felt a little calm as Marta got scolded.Hm.Whoever this woman was, she must have some real power in the place. She must be Marta's superior.

The woman lowered her angry eyes to my file and went through it. It took some seconds, then she handed it back.

"You'll get a call in a couple of days. I'll see what we can do with you."

I dipped my head. "Thank you so much, ma'am."

She glared at Marta once more before walking away.

"Good thing there are people with brains in this place," I mumbled to the hearing of Marta.

I caught herglare and glared back at her before leaving.
The death of the little boy still stung. It could've been avoided.Marta was a real bitch
I drove at an infuriating speed until I got to Darkspire. I was still in the car when I checked my email and discovered the garden manager had sent the footage. I was a little nervous as I clicked play, and the video came into view.

The camera was only at the entrance to the garden. So I couldn't see what happened in there.

But it showed the moment Marta entered, followed by me, minutes later.

A while later, Marta left. And to my astonishment, Alpha Zarek went in.

What the heck?

I replayed the video to make sure my eyes weren't deceiving me. Marta must have left when I was already asleep on the table. So, what was Alpha Zarek doing there!?

###Chapter 45 
JARIS

Today was the most important day in our world. And I wasn't going to miss out on it.

I walked into the Silver Citadel and found the Alphas, thechairman and other representatives gathered as expected. Everything was getting set, and they were all very shocked to see me. That, also expected.

"Alpha Jaris. What're you doing here?" One of the representatives asked. Although, I could see the hope in his eyes.

"What does it look like, Adan? I am here to participate." I shrugged.

Today was the registration for the Alphas seeking to contend for the King's Throne.

"What are you talking about? I thought you were not interested?" One of the Alphas asked.

Their fear was so obvious. They already knew they didn't stand a chance against someone like me.

Well, initially, I had no interest in participating. But not anymore.

I pinned Zarek with a stare as I replied to the other Alpha. "I changed my mind. I just realized having this power would be awNesome."

I'd be dead before I'd sit back and watch Zarek win the throne. I wanted it all.

I could tell he was displeased, despite how much he tried to hide it. Well, he should be. He was nothing now.

"Well, we are glad to have you here," One of the representatives said with a bright smile.

We commenced the process. Our bloods were taken and we were made to swear an oath. This was to prevent us from causing a fight and shedding blood during and after the process. We are all expected to embrace our wins or losses.

"Congratulations, gentlemen. And welcome to this great phase," the chairman declared. There were to be three trials in total. A date for the first trial was announced, which was two weeks from now.

After a few more announcements and cautions, we were done and free to go.

As expected, Zarek walked up to me as I headed for my car.

"Are you doing this because your girl threw herself at me?" It didn't miss the pain in his voice.

I made a mental note to give him the satisfaction of losing my own temper.

"I'm actually here to make sure you don't win. But I guess you have multiple options. You can pick any of your choice," I answered without looking at him.

"Come on, Jaris! You already said you weren't interested! Why don't you just step back and let this go?"

I stopped in front of my car where Kael already held the front door open. I turned to Zarek. "Why are you so afraid? It looks like you're so certain that you stand no chance against me." I nodded. "It's good to know.Didn't think you were this smart."

I turned to enter into my car, but the asshole had the guts to hold my hand.

"Stop this, Jar-" he didn't get to finish his sick statement as I punched him hard in the jaw.

He stumbled back, his hand flying to his face. One more move and I'd have sent my claws into his heart without regret.

Glaring at him, I entered into my car and left.

****+****+


LYRIC

I kept checking the time. I couldn't wait for Marta to get home and provide me with some answers. For her shake, I hope she had something to say concerning Zarek coming into the garden shortly after she left,while I was still asleep.

When I knew the kids would be back from school, I headed to their room to check on Xylon. He told me he felt fine and even hungry. That was good news. His nanny brought him some food and I watched them eat.

"Aunty, we have something for you." Xyla said, by the time they finished eating.

"Ooh. You've got me curious. What's that?"

She and Xylon exchanged a glance and giggled before they ran into their closet. What were they-

I gasped when I saw them coming out with a present! For the love of Selene!

"Did you get me a gift!?" I asked, completely astonished.

They nodded with their cheeks turning crimson.

"Oh,dearests.How very cute of you. You shouldn't have bothered!" I tookit from them.

"We just wanted to congratulate you for getting mated to daddy." Xyla said while Xylon nodded with a smile.

My heart sank, my spirits turning sour. I tried to hide it from the kids.

"This is so... thoughtful. Thank you. So much."

We all sat on the bed as I unwrapped the package. It came as an even bigger shock when I realized it was a set of jewelries-necklace, earrings and a bracelet.

What in hell?

"How did you get the money for this?"

The kids looked at me like I'd asked a weird question.

"We get a lot of allowance, Aunty." Xyla rolled her eyes.

Oh.What an attitude.

I laughed.

Xylon took his tab and scribbled down on it. "There's a mall in our school. Xyla and I saw this and decided to get it for you."

Hm.I playfully pulled his chin. "I am so touched. Thank you. So so much."

"Do you like them?" Xyla asked.

"What're you saying? I adore them! They're the best things I own right now."

I hugged them.

The door opened, revealing the devil in a brown dress. I forced myself not to roll my eyes as I closed up the box in my hand.

"What's going on here?" Marta asked, her eyes on my gift.

"Nothing. The kids were just being sweet."

She looked at the wrap on the floor. "Did you bring a gift to them or what?"

"It's the opposite. They were just congratulating me."

I noticed a dark glint in her eyes as she looked at Xylon and Xyla.

"It's a good thing you're back, Marta. I've been waiting for you." I stood up. "We need to talk."

Without arguing-fortunately-she followed me out of the room.

"Why did Alpha Zarek come into the garden shortly after you left?" I crossed my arms.

She scoffed, giving me a ridiculous look. "And how am I supposed to know that? Like you said, 'after I left.'Don't you think you're asking the wrong person?"

"Well, I don't know why, but I feel there's something off about that night. Now that I think of it, it's very strange that you'd call me over to discuss the safety of your kids."

"Hold on. You're trying to say me calling you to discuss my kids' well-being is trash?" She huffed. "Well, you don't have a child, obviously. Otherwise, you'd have known how important it is to take such matters seriously." Her words ran a deep wound. They cut me so bad I thought I was bleeding for real.

My eyes turned deadlier as I stepped up to her.

"For your sake, I do hope you're telling the truth, Marta. Because, believe me, it won't be funny if I get to know you lied to me and did something stupid that night."

She met my stare with defiance, but I could see the tiny crack in her expression.
###Chapter 46
LYRIC



There was a party tonight.



One of the top ranking Alphas was celebrating his birthday. It was going to be a mega party and of course, very fun. But for the past few days, since the news of it circulated, I'd been trying to push it behind me.



Until Jace and I were on a phone call this evening and he had to remind me of it.



"What're you wearing to the party? You need to dress to kill. It's a game of who looks the finest, Lyric." He gleamed.



Yeah, I know. This was one reason I never attended such parties years back. The pressure was often too much,and well, with the scar on my face, I never truly fit in.



"I don't think I'm going." I lowered my eyes as my countenance dropped.



"What?Why?"


When I said nothing, he realized. "Shit. Jaris hasn't asked you yet, has he?"


According to our contract, I was supposed to accompany him to such events. But considering the fact that we haven't spoken to each other since we got mated, I wasn't so sure anymore. Although, I'd have really loved to go with him.



"It doesn't matter. You can still come on your own,Ly.I can come get you if you want," Jace suggested but I shook my head.


I just felt it'd be weird if I had to show up to such an event without my new mate. And I was almost sure Jaris would be going. Wouldn't it be wrong if we went separately?



Jace spent the remaining minutes of our call trying to talk me into going alone. But in the end,I refused.


When the call ended, I made my way to my closet and smiled wistfully as I stared at the fine green dress standing in the middle of the room. I felt a pang of sadness as I ran my finger through the rich stoned fabric.



I'd gotten it on the day I was buying my ceremonial dress. I'd hoped to wear it on my first official outing with Jaris, just like tonight. I wanted to make a good impression by his side.



But apparently, it was useless. *****+****+


JARIS



It took me hours to get back to Darkspire.


Despite what I'd achieved today, despite knowing that Zarek had lost his chance at winning, I was far from satisfied.



I made my way to my room to have a cold shower.


My hands against the wall, I felt that familiar sense of unease I'd been feeling for the past one week. It traveled all the way to my cock.


I shut my eyes and tried to resist it. I tried to push the memory into a dark corner of my mind. But no matter how hard I tried, it kept coming back like a storm.



I was frustrated.


Yet, in the end, I had no choice but to give in to the demand. My hand rose to my erection, jerking at the image of a certain woman, wet and naked. A woman l should have no business thinking about. A woman l hated that I was thinking about.


It made me angry as much as it brought me pleasure.And in a few minutes, I came done in my hand,my release dropping to the floor. I'll admit-the feeling was always euphoric. The best kind of feeling.


But after I climbed down from my high, the weight of my actions dawned on me-like always. I suddenly hated myself for being hard and coming to the mere erotic image of someone that had betrayed me.


What was even more infuriating? I wanted more.



It was the fourth time I was cuming to her image in the bathroom, and each time, it left me wanting more.Wanting more than the pleasure my hands provided.


I detested it, but my will seemed to be useless against the matter.



Who the hell was this witch?



Angrily I finished my shower and returned to the room to get dressed.



I was pissed now and couldn't even sleep. So, I thought of distracting myself with some letters and documents in my home office.



I was deep into it when someone knocked,sparking my irritation for distracting me.


"Who's it?" I rasped.


The door opened slowly, followed by the face of the one woman I didn't want to lay eyes on right now.


What the hell?



My fingers tightened around my pen as I did all I could to keep my anger at bay.


She walked in, wearing a black short that stopped above her knee, and a mesh top on it.


Her hair was up in a tight ponytail, her lips colored with a nude lipstick.


She looked simple yet undeniably alluring.


I lowered my eyes to the papers in front of me,refusing to acknowledge that thought.


"What're you doing here?" The words came out clipped.




I could tell she was nervous. And her eyes looked sad.


"Um.... Good evening, Alpha Jaris." I didn't miss the tremor in her voice.



Why was she so afraid? She'd never been afraid to disobey me. She wasn't afraid when she slept with Zarek.



| lifted my eyes to her, starting from her legs. imagined Zarek running his dirty hands up those legs. I imagined him touching what he was never supposed to touch.



She had kissed him so passionately in the video. The video was muted, but I had seen her lips moving They'd been talking. I didn't want to imagine the filthy words she must've been saying to him.


I thought she could be different. I thought she was decent. But she was cheap. Disappointingly so.


"What do you want, Lyric?" I needed her to leave as soon as possible.


The hostility in my voice must affect her,because l could see the slight recoil.


"I um... I just wanted to ask about the party. Alpha Rhys' party. From the contract, you mentioned me accompanying me to such events. But you haven't said anything. So..."


While she went on speaking, I kept trying to picture what stupid hold she had over me. Why couldn't I get her out of my head?



And even now, the reason I desperately wanted her gone was because she was distracting me.Hearing her speak, all I wanted to do was haul her to the wall,rip off her clothes and fuck her.



But I shouldn't want that. I hated this woman for what she did to me. I shouldn't desire her this way. So,what was this stupid pull that kept drawing me to her?
###Chapter 47

JARIS



"I'm going with Marta," I supplied when she was done,returning my attention to the files in front of me.


She must be surprised because she was speechless for some time.



I didn't care. I just continued ticking and writing on my files.



"O... Okay," she said at last, clearing her throat.


But for a moment longer, she stood there, as if waiting for me to say something else. But I didn't even look at her.



As usual, that stupid pull was imploring me to take a look and say something, but I won over it. I didn't.


And shortly after, she opened the door and left







LYRIC



pain knifed me in the chest as I watched Jaris and Marta go into their waiting car, leaving for the party. Marta was wearing a long blue dress, looking so beautiful. For a moment there, I wondered if she was prettier than me. Maybe that was the reason Jaris preferred her company to mine.


Was I still ugly in somne way? Do l embarrass him?


My vision soon became blurry with the tears that filled my eyes, and when their car drove out of the gate,the tears fell.


I drew the curtains and turned around. Standing before the mirror, I wiped my tears.


This was it. I was done allowing myself to get hurt.I made a promise to myself three years ago that I'd never let anyone hurt me again. I didn't know what Jaris' problem was, but I was tired of being wounded by him.


****十＊＊＊＊＋



JARIS



One of the reasons I hated taking Marta as my plus-one to parties was as a result of how clingy she could be.



She kept her arm wrapped around mine, wearing her big stage smile as we walked into the party. As expected, it was filled with important guests. AndI didn't miss the pause in the atmosphere when they laid eyes on me.



"Jaris!" The celebrant-Rhys-called as he came toward me with a wide grin.


He tapped me on the shoulder. "I'm glad you made it."


"I didn't have a choice. Happy birthday, Rhys."



He laughed to my response.


Well,since I was aiming for the Alpha King's Throne,I needed to do well with public functions andproving to the other Alphas that I could be there for them. It was a shitty demand, but a necessary one.


Anyway, Rhys was the closest thing I had to a friend.We've known each other since childhood, went to the same school and all. He likes to brag about the fact that we're close, but I wouldn't really say I had any friends. I grew used to people avoiding me and shut my heart to those who truly wanted to be close.


"Marta." He nodded at her.



"Hi, Rhys. Happy birthday."


"Oh.Forget about the birthday. I just needed a reason to spend money." He shrugged while Marta laughed. 

Rhys glanced behind me.


"You didn't come with..."



"I believe you're not blind. I didn't." I snapped.


"Hm. It's been less than a week and things are already this bad between you two? What happened, anyway?I heard you showed up quite late to the mating ceremony. A lot of guests had already left, thinking you wouldn't come."



I glared at him. "Are we here for your party or mine?"


He laughed.



A waiter stopped by, placing two glasses of wine on the table before me.



Rhys left to attend to other guests. But well, I didn't need to go to the guests. They came to me.


One good thing about gaining power.







About an hour later, Rhys returned to my side, bringing up side talks about Packs and Alphas at war.


"Isn't that... your mate?" He suddenly asked mid-sentence, looking at the door. I turned along with everyone and found Lyric making her way in. I frowned. She came alone?



"Damn, she looks gorgeous, Jar."



My balls tightened at the realization. She did look gorgeous.Her dress was stunning and her face was..well,always pretty.



The thought unnerved me.



She walked into the place like a boss, radiating a certain kind of confidence that commanded attention and turned heads.



She didn't look intimidated that she was entering such a place alone. Usually, Rhys' party was strictly by invitation. But the men at the gates must have let her through when they realized she was my mate.



"To be honest," Rhys leaned in. "I'd have preferred someone like her standing by my side over Marta." He lifted his hands. "Just saying."


Marta was no longer by my side, having gone to meet up with some friends.



I didn't give a response to that.


Though I didn't want to, I kept my eyes on Lyric as she made her way to the counter and ordered a drink.I wasn't the only one staring nonstop at her.Every man in the room was.



"We'll be dancing soon," Rhys said. "I'd like to dance with her if you don't mind."



"Whatever," I mumbled, emptying the last content of my glass into my mouth.



"Oh. You don't mind? Thanks, man." He clapped me on the shoulder and took some steps forward



"I'll break your bones if you go to her." I reached for another glass of wine.



He stopped walking and laughed. "And here I was,thinking you didn't care. Well, you better go ask her to the dance, then. This place is filled with men who wouldn't want a pretty lady like her dancing alone."



Fucking no.I couldn't lay my hands on her.


Rhys winked at me and left.
###Chapter 48 

LYRIC


I didn't know where Jaris was in this huge hall. And I didn't want to.



I knew the party would be fun. And since he wouldn't come with me, I decided to come alone.


Unfortunately, Jace got very busy and couldn't make it. But I didn't let even that stop me.



I knew the attention I garnered from the guests.Tonight, I really wanted to have fun.



"Hi."



I turned around to find two smiling ladies before me


"Hi." I furrowed my brows but wvaved.


They didn't look familiar. Although, they were richly dressed,letting me know they were important figures.



One was light skinned and the other dark. But they were both very beautiful.



"You're Lyric, right?" The lighter one asked. "Yes?"



"I'm Juan. And this is..."



"Becky. I can introduce myself, J." The dark one rolled her eyes.


"So, we've had our eyes on you for some time now."Juan said.



"I mean,you're pretty."



"And Jaris' mate."



I chuckled. I liked the way they spoke.



"Actually, I'm Rhys' mate," Juan said.


Oh.



"Nice meeting you." I extended my hand, and they gladly took it.


They joined me at the counter, and just like that, we got talking like we had known each other for weeks.


"Tell me, what is it like being mated to Jaris? Is he a bit romantic?" Becky asked, unsettling me.



I shrugged. "Can't really say."


"Yeah. Sorry if you feel bothered. It's just that... we didn't think Jaris would have a mate. Of course,he needed a Luna as an Alpha, but we didn't think he had it in him to be even a bit loving."



"You don't need to love someone to make them your mate, Beck." Juan nudged her. "Are you forgetting that most Lunas suffer a loveless union with the Alphas?"



Mine was worse than lovelessness. He hated me. And he was only going to use me for a year.


The MC suddenly climbed the stage, announcing the dance.



"Oops. Time to leave you ladies alone. I need to go dance with my birthday boy." Juan winked at us and left.



"| guess someone like me would have to wait for a Prince charming to approach me." Becky made a pout."Um... don't you think you should be dancing with Alpha Jaris? Although, he did come with Marta."


"We're not dancing," I took a sip from my glass.


Couples were already filling the dance floor.



"Hi." A young man walked up to me.

 
I didn't know his name, but I knew he was an Alpha. He held out his hand. "Can I have this dance?"



My breath froze for a moment. I wasn't sure Jaris would like this.



'Jaris is here with Marta!'



'And you're here to have fun.'



Yes.Fun.



Smiling, I took the Alpha's hand, and he took me to the stage.



Unchained Melody by The Righteous Brothers hit the stage, and together, we danced according to the rhythm.



I kept scouring my eyes around the stage, looking for him and the woman he choose over me. But | couldn't find them. Shouldn't they be dancing?


"You're quite beautiful, Lyric," my dance partner whispered in my ear.



"Thanks."



"I hear you're Jaris' mate."



I stiffen.Geez! It felt like everyone knew me already as his mate. How sad. "He's a lucky man, I must say. If I had met you before him, I'd have fought tooth and nail to get you by my side." He chuckled, trying to make it sound like a joke.



Only I knew he wasn't joking.



"You don't have a mate?" I raised a brow.



"Well, I do. But with a face like yours, I'd reject her in the twinkle of an eye." He laughed again. But this time,it wasn't funny. I detest men like him. Men like Roderick.



I was about pulling away from his grasp when Jaris-shockingly-appeared beside us.


I startled, taking a moment to regain my calm.



"Alpha Jaris." My partner stopped moving with me.



The dance was still ongoing, and it was awkward that the three of us just stood there, unmoving.



"With me, Lyric. Now." He spoke in that tone that usually brooked no room for argument. That tone that told me he was pissed.



I excused myself from the Alpha and went after him.



I followed Jaris out, into the cold night air.



"What're you doing, Lyric?" He stopped as soon as we were far from the noise.



I looked around before lifting my hands up and down."I don't think I follow."



"You being here." He slipped one hand into his pocket.I could tell he was fighting to keep his cool."You dancing with the men and-"



"Sorry, am I also not allowed to come to parties myself when you wouldn't wanna go with me? Does my life revolve around you now?"



He stepped toward me. "You don't interrupt me when I'm talking,Lyric. Never."



I balled my hands into fists.


Taking a deep breath, I forced my voice to sound as clear as possible. "I'd like to go back to the party if you don't mind."


I turned around to leave.



"Damn it, Lyric! Don't make me do something crazy!"He snapped, turning me back to him.



"What exactly do you want from me!?"



"You're my Luna now! Almost everyone knows this.And while I don't want to give a shit about what you do with your time, I can't have you bring more shame to my name."


More shame? What was he talking about?



"Right now, I'd rather you go home. But if you choose to stay, then you must make sure you're not even a hundred feet close to any man."


My eyes turned glossy as I gave him that ridiculous stare.



"What makes you think it's cool that you get to set the rules!?" I half-yelled. "Just incase you have no idea, Alpha Jaris, it is utterly tiring that I get to be treated like trash while you get away with so many things."



"You think you're being treated like trash..."


"Yes!" I cut him off. Oh, to hell with the rules! "First,you show up late to our mating ceremony and act like I was a slave who was being forced on you. You didn't even give me an explanation. Instead, you slept wvith Marta that night. You slept with another woman!


"I understand...I understand that it's all a contract and we have no business in each other's lives. But it was our first night being mated. Did you have to do that!?"Tears streaked my cheeks. "Be so mean? You get to break the rules while I get treated like trash. Why don't we both live fairly, huh? Why don't you let me live freely, as much as you do? Why don't you free me from these chains!?"



I dabbed my tears. "I didn't deserve what you did to me. It was more than a betrayal, Alpha. You fucking hurt me!"


"Jaris?" Someone called behind me. I noticed his gaze also shift.


When I turned, Marta was there, looking concerned.


I wiped my face as I turned back to Jaris. "Your date is here. Why don't you go back to her while I find something else to do with my life."


It was a bit stunning-his silence. But I didn't bring myself to care.


I just walked away from them both, heading to my car.


Gods, I hated my life. I hated ever coming back home.And I hated ever listening to my father and going to Darkspire.







JARIS



I was pissed. Throughout the remaining hours of the party, I only kept myself busy with drinks.


Lyric's words replayed in my head. She thought she had the right to be angry? After everything?


And oh, she even thought I slept with Marta that night.I was tempted to laugh at her at that point.


Obviously, it hurt her. And I liked it. At least, she got a taste of what she made me go through that night.


I'd been compelled to confront her about what she did,but ifI did, things would get really bad between us.She probably thinks I don't know what she did. She thinks her secret is safe with Zarek. If I bring it up and we talk about it; I watch her cry and apologize, I'll never be able to look her in the face again.


The only reason I'm still able to tolerate her sometimes is because she hasn't confessed to it herself.



I didn't wait for the party to end before I desired to go home. I left with my people and didn't say a word the entire ride, not even when Marta had tried to strike a lake conversation.



I headed to my bathroom, taking a quick shower and ignoring the bulge in my pants.



I changed into my nightwear and decided to check for updates on my laptop. Turned out there were some rogue attacks an hour ago, though it was far from Darkspire. I was checking for more updates when Nerion knocked.





"Boss." He entered. He always preferred calling me boss to Alpha. "Thought you'd like to know that Lyric is not back yet."
###Chapter 49
JARIS



I snapped my head up from my laptop to his face."What're you talking about?" I glanced at the time."It's eleven." And she left the party a long time ago.I thought she was heading home.


"Have you tried calling her?" I picked up my phone


"Yes. She isn't answering. I've dropped her multiple texts too. No response."



What the hell?



I tried calling her with my phone but got the same feedback.



"Let her be. I'm sure she's just being silly." I dismissed Nerion.



But by one a.m, she still wasn't back and now, I was fucking pissed.


Where the fuck was she!? Had she gone to meet Zarek or another secret lover of hers?



Kael and Nerion called her father and even her male friend, but none of them knew where she was. My mind suddenly drifted to the rogue attack. The news mentioned some victims. But it didn't happen close to Darkspire.



What if she was in the area when it happened?



Fuck.



I stormed toward the car.



"Where are we going?" Nerion asked, already fishing the car key from his pocket.


"Where the rogue attack happened."



I held out to my hand to him when we got to the car."I'm driving."



He looked uncertain but ended up passing the keys to me.



In less than a mninute, myself, Nerion and Kael were on the road with me driving at a crazy speed.


It took us forty-five minutes to reach the location.Some wolf guards had already taken care of the scene with a few of them still lingering around.


They looked at me with surprise when they saw me."Alpha Jaris."


"I need to see the victims." I cut them off.I wasn't here for the unnecessary pleasantries.


He pointed to the back of a truck for me and without hesitating, I rushed over. There were three covered bodies. I uncovered them and checked out their faces.Two males. One female.



"She's not here," Nerion said behind me.



Yes. She's not.



I couldn't believe the amount of relief that crushed me.





I walked away from the bodies, took out my phone and called Rhys.



"Hey,man..."



"Lyric didn't happen to come back to your party after I left, did she?" | cut him off.



"Jaris, the party's over."



And down went my last ball of hope.



"But she's here. In my home." Rhys added, surprising me.



It sounded like I'd just been told that I was born a woman.



"What're you talking about?" I scoffed, my face crumpling in confusion.


"Apparently, my mate and her sister befriended her at the party. Juan is hosting this mini girls-only after party, and she invited Lyric. So, they're all here,having the fun of their lives."



No way. I was worried sick, and the whole time, Lyric was somewhere partying?


I ended the call, angrily storming into the car with Kael and Nerion. It was a good thing they were with me, because there was no telling what I'd do when I finally laid eyes on Lyric Harper. Or Dreadmoor.Whichever it was.



It took me another forty-five minutes to get to Rhys ' Pack. Heck, I should be sleeping right now,considering the fact that I have a very busy day tomorrow.



Rhys must already be expecting me,because l met him outside when we reached.



"You shouldn't have bothered, Jaris. She's fine." He tried to calm the situation.



"Take me to her, Rhys. Now."



He led the way, taking me into the house and to the second balcony where I could see the pool area below. They were there, about twenty ladies, drinking,dancing, laughing and having fun. I felt the speakers were a bit too loud, and it grated on my nerves. Or maybe it was just me being easily irritated.



Right in the middle of it, on the center stage they'd created,Lyric stood tall, dancing and shaking her wet hair around.



Wet hair. Wet body.


No. I pushed the memory back.


She had changed from the green dress she wore to a free knee-length gown. Where the hell did she get that from?



She had a microphone and was singing along with the song coming through the speakers. She sounded horrific-which wasn't a surprise, considering how drunk she was. But she looked happy. So so happy. I'd never seen Lyric that way before.



She belched into the mic and laughed out loud, her partners in crime joining her in the laughter.


"Go,girl!" Someone clapped.



She walked around the fake stage, shaking her head,throwing her arms around like a celebrity performing in front of a large crowd. She even bent down at some point to shake the hands of her audience.



Rhys chuckled beside me. "She's quite fun. Been entertained for a while now."



I shot a dagger at him through my eyes before returning my gaze to Lyric.


Suddenly,I realized my rage toward her was gone. At least, she wasn't dancing with a man. And she looked so happy.


But fun time was over.



"I'm taking her home." I turned to leave. Rhys grabbed my wrist.



"Seriously, Jar!? I told you it's strictly girls-only. Juan will have my head if I let you walk in there."



"Then, find a way to bring her out, Rhys. 'Cause I swear,I'll do it myself if you don't."


Rhys looked frustrated. Well, his business. I was exhausted and wanted to go home, and the gods of the Moon knew there was no way I was leaving Lyric behind.



Grumbling something under his breath, Rhys stared downstairs, and I followed him. I waited by my car while he proceeded to the pool area. Few minutes later, he was out with a very drunk Lyric and a furious Juan behind him.



What the hell was his bitch doing here?


"Seriously, Jaris? You're being so unreasonable. The party was supposed to last until morning," Juan grouse as Rhys handed my package to me.


"I'm sure Lyric is neither the host nor the celebrant. Go have fun with the rest of the girls." I opened the back door and shoved Lyric into the seat, throwing her purse next.


Then, I started walking around to the other side of the car. "You're being so mean to her, yet you wouldn't even let her have fun."



What?



"Hey, babe. That's okay." Rhys held her hand.



His woman must be drunk. Because Juan wouldn't have the guts to talk back at me on a normal day.



And how was Lyric already spilling things about us to people she just met?



"She's a fine woman, Jaris! If you don't want he, let her go. I'm sure there are a million men out there who would die to have her!" Juan half-yelleld as I opened the backdoor. 
Yup.Definitely drunk.



"Put a chain on her, Rhys. Or better still, on that mouth." I glared at Rhys before lowering into the backseat.



Drunk Lyric poked her head out the window. "Don't worry, Juan! We won't be together for long!" She waved at her newfound friend while smiling sheepishly.


There was a sudden ache in my heart. I looked at Lyric and felt my anger build toward her.



Roughly, I pulled her into the car and rolled up the glass.



Nerion took the driver seat while Kael sat next to him.Then we hit the road.



Lyric kept mumbling and humming incoherent words.But what got to me the most was the fact that she was very wet and drenching my seat.


Wet. In this casual ddress.


Against my will, my eyes found her chest. I could see the outline of her black foam-less bra. I'd been able to spot her panties when Rhys was bringing her to me.And to think Rhys had likely seen that as well.


I forced my eyes away, pushing thoughts of Lyric out of my mind.



She giggled and suddenly did something insane. She rested her head on my shoulder. Her wet hair on my shoulder.



"Ugh. You shouldn't have come." She grunted. "Fun.Having fun. Without you."



When I looked into her face, her eyes were closed.But there was a smile on her face. Was she really unhappy around me? Around Darkspire? She now preferred the company of others?


'She's done worse to you, Jaris,' my subconscious scolded me. 'She deserves to be unhappy.'
###Chapter 50

 LYRIC



I woke up with a terrible hangover.


My head ached terribly. The first thing I did was soak myself into the Jacuzzi.


It wasn't until I was a little calm that I recalled all that had happened the previous night. When I did, fury pulsed in my bloodstream.


Jaris.



As usual, he was there and ruined my night. Dragged me away when I was having the fun of my life.For the first time since I met him, I felt genuinely happy.


Done bathing, I checked my email and nearly screamed in excitement wvhen I found one from TCH,asking me to come over by ten.



I checked the time. It was past nine.



Shit.



As fast as lightening, I fished for what to wear-black corporate pants with a red top-hastily brushed my hair, packed it into a ponytail and applied a red lipstick. Hm. The red lipstick looked really good on me today.


Perfect.



I grabbed my bag and file and hurried out of the room.


Finally, some good news. I'd be beyond grateful if I could get this job. At least, it'd keep me busy and keep my mind off some depressing thoughts.


I fished for my car keys in my bag as I hurried down the passage. I noticed someone coming before me-someone with a familiar scent.



Lifting my head, I found 'him' coming.



Jaris.



Nerion was beside him, seemingly giving him a report.


My heart skipped a beat as our eyes locked. I had that familiar mix of hurt and confusion flood me.



Time seemed too slow, but we didn't stop walking.And as we got close, I noticed his eyes linger on my lips.



I furrowed my brows, wondering why the hell he was staring at my lips.


I dip my head to him as we walked past each other.There was a great sense of unease and loss as we lost eye contact.



I released a deep breath.



'Focus, Lyric. We have an important day ahead.'







On my way to TCH, Jace called me.


I picked the call and put it on speaker so my hands could focus on the steering.



After our usual greetings and teasing, he told me the reason he called.



"I just texted you Alpha Zarek's number."



Oh. What a relief.



"Thanks a lot, Jace." I smiled like he could see me.


"I wish you'd tell me what you need the number for.I'm kind of worried, Ly."



"Please, don't be. Trust me, I'm not doing anything that'd get me in trouble. I'm not you."



He huffed. "Of course. I'm the one who gets into trouble because I'm always taking care of your mess."


 
I rolled my eyes. We talked some more before the call ended.



I'd been hoping Zarek would be at the party last night.It was one of the reasons I was hell-bent on going. So,since he didn't show up, I asked Jace for his contact.


I needed to ask him about that night. I didn't trust the fact that he had come into the garden, right after Marta left.



My phone beeped with a new message, and when l got to a traffic stop, I checked it out.


It was from Kael.



'Hi, Lyric. Let me know as soon as you get back to Darkspire.I need your help.'


Huh? I arched my brows in surprise. Kael needing my help? What the hell was going on?







A few minutes later, I arrived at TCH.


When I showed one of the ladies at the reception my email,she showed me where to wait.



I waited alone for almost an hour before the woman from the other day who I suspected was Marta's superior, walked up to me. "Good morning, ma'am." I rose to my feet.


"Good morning, Mrs. Dreadmoor." She shook my hands. "Sorry you had to wait for long. Please come with me."



I followed her into the elevator and onto a certain floor. She looked strict and always spoke in that stern,professional tone. Like the kind of woman that didn't take nonsense from anyone.


I caught her name on the tag on her coat. Dr.Guinevere.



"Before we begin, you'll need to meet with someone.I tried not to make it happen, but he insisted. And with him,one could hardly say 'no'."



I looked at her with surprise. Who was she referring to?



We got to a door which she pushed open, and my heart nearly jumped out of my chest when I found Jaris in the office, leaning against the table, his legs crossed in front of him while he gave me that piercing look like he was the boss.



"I'll be in ward four on this floor when you two are done. Just find me." The woman left.



I stayed rooted at the door for some seconds before dragging my legs in. What's he doing here? Here to ruin this tiny fragment of happiness I'm trying to have?


I didn't say a word as I stood, waiting for him to do the talking.


And finally, he did. "Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is to get to hear from strangers that my mate is applying to TCH?"



I frowned, not quite getting his point.


"When were you going to tell me that you had plans of working here?"


It was all I could do not to scoff and shrug instead."I didn't think it was mandatory for me to tell you."


"Lyric Harper, don't start with me."


Wait, what? Why was he still addressing me by my father's name? He didn't like me bearing his name or what?



"I should be informed if you're planning on working in a place like TCH. I shouldn't be getting to hear it from strangers." He grumped.


"Well, I'm sorry, but incase you haven't noticed, you and I haven't exactly been on talking terms. On our mating night, you specifically told me to stay as far away from you as possible. I'm only doing that."


I noticed his jaw clench. He glanced up at the ceiling,as if contemplating a thought. But I could tell he was pissed.



"You do know I have the power to have you kicked out, don't you?" My eyes widened in disbelief when he uttered those insane words.



I knew it. I knew he was here to ruin this little peace.


"In case you had no idea, the woman that just left is my aunt-my father's sister. And the one at the top,the one everybody answers to-he's a member of Darkspire. You could say I have TCH wrapped around my finger."
###Chapter 51 
LYRIC



"What do you want from me!?" My voice rose a notch,tears starting to hit the back of my eyes.



"An apology." His eyes nor words held no emotion.
"For not keeping me updated on such a huge step."



"But you told me to stay away from you!"



"Then, you should've sent a text or something. I just hate that I had to hear it from someone else, Lyric!"



Oh, damn it. Luna Isolde is a very pretty woman,but she did a poor job raising her son. He was a manipulative monster!



"I'm sorry." I ground the words.


He pushed away from the table, coming toward me."I can't hear you, Lyric."


What? I looked up at him, same time a stupid tear came rolling down my eyes.



"I said... I'm sorry." I swallowed hard.



It was humiliating to know I was apologizing even when he was the one that had done me wrong. Over and over again.


He ate up the distance between us until there was nothing left separating us. Then,he stared down at me.Since he was so tall and I wasn't, it was easy peering down at me like I was beneath him.



"Good." His tone was clipped.



I noticed his eyes trail to my lips again. But he looked away just as quickly.


Without uttering another word, he shouldered past me,walking out the door.







Making sure my face was clean of any of the pathetic tears I'd shed for him, I went out to look for Guinevere.


She was with Marta who threw deadly glares my way.


"| can see you're done." Guinevere turned to me. "Ms.Monroe will take it from here."



I followed Marta out of the ward, curious to know what was next.



"Before you get accepted, we'll have to test you." She hit the elevator button. "It's standard procedure. We'll see how well you perform, which would determine if you get to join us or not."


She took us to the ground floor, into a surgical ward I found a doctor inside and three others standing and watching from outside.


"What's going on?" I asked in a tone only Marta could hear.



She shrugged casually. "You claim to be so good at what you do. I'm sure you wouldn't have a problem proving to the team how good you are with surgery."


My jaw dropped. "What? But I never told you l was good at surgery."



"But you kept hinting at the fact that you're better than me. Besides, I already told them you're a pro at surgery, Lyric. It'd be disastrous if you told them you couldn't do it now. Believe me, they'll kick you out without second thoughts."


My heart skipped a beat. This was a set up. She was looking for a way for me to give up myself.


She smirked as she walked into the ward. I glanced at the people watching from outside, staring at me with beady eyes. They looked like the kind of people that would look out for your failure rather than your success.



Taking a deep breath, I went in with Marta. "And just so you know," she tilted her head to my side so me alone could hear her. "He's sick with Moonlit Affliction. It's at its terminal stage, which is why a lot of us here have been unwilling to help him. No one wants the blood of someone as powerful as him in our hands."



Him?



I looked at the unfamiliar face of the old man asleep on the bed. "Wh-Who's he?"



"Alpha Zarek's father."



What?



I looked at her with disbelief. It'd be very bad if the retired Alpha gets to die in my hands. I didn't even know what Zarek's deal was with me yet.



The doctor in the room came up to me with a nurse beside her, holding some materials.



"Mrs. Dreadmoor. We've been expecting you," the doctor said with a warm smile.



I noticed Marta roll her eyes when the woman called me by Jaris' name.


The nurse handed me a coat and some surgical gloves.


"Doctor Monroe tells us you're very good at this," the nice doctor said.



"Y-Yeah." I guess.


Gods, I was so nervous. I'd never operated on anyone before. And the man's condition seemed serious.


Marta was evil. She was setting me up for failure so I'd never get accepted.


The nice doctor went ahead to brief me on the surgery.


"Don't worry, I'll be here to guide you. Just in case things go, you know, haywire." She concluded with a smile and a tap on my hand.


"Thanks." I managed to smile back.


When I looked back at the window, doctor Guinevere had joined the others watching me.


There wNere so many eyes now. I couldn't fail in front of them. I'd lose this job.



Marta came closer to me, as if to reassure me.She whispered in my ear. "Now, show them how much of a loser you are, Lyric."

###Chapter 52
LYRIC



I flinched from her words. If there weren't so many eyes on us, I'd have yelled at her to fuck off.



She smiled as she stepped away from.me, going out of the room to join the rest of the doctors watching me.



Inhaling for courage, I went closer to the patient. The moment I touched his hand, I knew what to do. What could help him.



It was going to be a complex surgery, but I think l could do it.







OUTSIDE THE ROOM.



"I hope this isn't a bad idea, Marta. You should've given her something easy to start with," one of the doctors watching aired her concern.



"It's called a test for a reason, doctor Meredith.Besides,don't worry, I'm sure she can handle it. She's quite good." Marta smiled. And between them, there was that unspoken relief hanging in the air: At least, if anything happened to the old man, his blood wouldn't be on their hands.







An hour into the surgery.


The man's vitals still looked stable. So far, Lyric hadn't done a mistake to set off the alarms.



"She looks like she knows what she's doing,"Someone remarked.



"Yeah. She's handling it quite well."



Marta's throat became scratchy.


No. There was still time. Time for Lyric to fail. No one had been able to treat Moonlit Affliction. Lyric wouldn't be the first.



But another hour into the surgery and Lyric was done.The assisting doctor in the room gave the ones outside a thumbs up, she too, looking surprised.


"She did it!" One of them gasped with relief. "By the moon,she did heal him!"



The man's vitals looked way better than they were before the surgery. He was going to be fine! 
"How did she do that!?" One of them shook her head.



In their whole years, they'd never seen anyone successfully carry out this surgery. How could the woman before them be capable of this?


Marta was as pale as a ghost. She wished for the ground to open and swallow her whole.



"Mrs. Monroe!" Guinevere chuckled. "You have no idea how happy I am that you brought her to this ward.You've done a really great job! We've found a gem!"



****+****+



LYRIC



I did it!



This had to be the best day of my life since I returned to the werewolf world. I was brimming with so much excitement I feared my heart would burst out of my chest.



The doctors were extremely happy and congratulated me for getting the job. Afterwards, Guinevere took me to her office where we discussed my payment. What she was offering was quite huge-more than what I'd expected. But I was more interested in the fact that I'd get to save more lives like the man in there. Xylon was right. There was too much suffering in the hospital, and someone with my gift shouldn't be in hiding. As long as I don't poke my nose where it does not belong, I won't get into trouble like the last time.



We concluded I'd resume fully in three days. It'd give me enough time to get prepared.


On my way out, I found Marta lurking outside the office. Had she been eavesdropping on our conversation?



She looked nervous. Wow. For the first time, Marta looked nervous.



"Well, I'd be ungrateful if I don't thank you, Marta. If you hadn't pushed me to my limits, I wouldn't have known what I was capable of."


I could see the disgust in her face. For the first time,yet again,she walked away without saying a word.



****	****



I was beyond happy.


Right now, all I wanted to do was go home and have some fun. Like play music in my room, pop a bottle and drink alone.



I wasn't just celebrating my new job. I was also celebrating the fact that I had the power to save a man's life. I had the gift to do what others are unable to do.



Maybe it wasn't really a curse if I use it right. Maybe it's a gift.



Getting to Darkspire, however, my plans were put on halt when Kael caught up with me in the middle of the hallway.


Oh, right. I'd almost forgotten about his text this morning.



We exchanged pleasantries before he told me the reason he was there.



"I have been running a task, and currently, I just bumped into a problem. I'm supposed to get something-a kind of access from the chairman. But after meeting with him, he told me he had handed those rights over to his son."



It took me two seconds longer to realize what he was asking.



Oh."Jace."



"Yes. Your hot-headed ill-mannered friend." He hissed,the words dripping with venom.


I tried and failed to stifle my smile. "But...now you need to ask for his help."



"Yes. And I think we both know your friend is too stubborn to grant me that access."


"Jace isn't all that bad," I rolled my eyes up, looking at him from the perspective of someone who had been my best friend and defender from childhood.


"Come on, Lyric. Even you can see how much of an annoying bastard he is. I hate that I need his help."Kael's words oozed with hostility.



I huffed at him. "And you think you're the saint? Or the victim? The two times you two have been in a fight you punched him first."



Kael looked like he'd roll his eyes if he could. Jace had a problem, no doubt. But Kael was no different and didn't have the right to judge him.


"Anyway," I crossed my arms. "What's my role in all of this?"



He looked calmer now. "I need your help setting up a meeting between us."



Hmph. I guess his pride wouldn't let him contact Jace himself. So, I have to be the middle woman. Well, I am definitely sensing a war coming.

###Chapter 53

Fortunately, Jace was free when I asked him to come over. In less than three hours, he was at Darkspire and met Kael and I in the little outdoor restaurant within the Pack.



Jace stopped in his tracks when he found Kael sitting at the table with me. I already told him he was to meet up with someone, but he didn't know it was Kael.



"The fuck is he doing here?" He asked with a crumpled look. "Is he holding you hostage or something,Lyric?Or he's just here to try to piss me off again?"


I noticed Kael fist his hand under the table,obviously fighting down his retort.


"Jace, please. Sit." I urged, tapping the empty seat.


He glared really hard at Kael before sitting down.


Two seconds later, it sank in before I could speak.


He raised his hands. "Nah, hold on. Don't tell me the 'someone' I'm supposed to meet is this fucker?"



"Call me fucker one more time and I'll fuck you up."Kael gritted. "Why don't you save it, man, for someone who can be fucked over by you."



Holy smokes.



"Could you two stop? Please!" I slightly hit the table,but it didn't seem to have much effect on the two men.



"Well, I am trying, Lyric. But like I said, he is too hot-headed and ill-mannered to listen!" Kael argued.



"Wow." Jace let out a slow clap. "Look who's talking.Mr. I-Punch-First-Think-Never is suddenly the etiquette police."


I took a deep breath. "Kael, if you need this to work,you'll have to actually calm down."


Thank goodness, they both keep quiet. But Kael looked really pissed. I guess he'd be doing a lot worse if he didn't need Jace's help right now.


"Why did you call me, Ly? You should talk fast 'cause the atmosphere here isn't so appealing," Jace said as he picked up my glass of wine and drank from it.


"Actually," I glanced at Kael. "He needs your help."


Jace choked. Wine sprayed onto the table as he coughed violently, shaking his head. 
"Hold up-did you just say he needs my help? With what? Digging his own grave? With what? Digging his grave?"



"Jace, come on. This is serious."



"Fine." He rolled his eyes. He shifted his eyes to Kael."What the hell do you need my help for?"


Kael seemed to struggle with his words. Poor thingg.It must be really hard on his ego.


"The Mountain Retreat in the East. Your father told me you have rights to it now. I need access."


Jace was numb for a moment, like he didn't quite understand Kael's words. Then, he burst into laughter.


"Oh, this is rich!" He clapped his hands togetherlike this was the best joke he'd heard all year. "So, Mr.Almighty finally needs me. I should call the news.'Kael Swallows His Pride'-headlines would be insane.Shocking to know you're human, after all."


"I am not begging, Jace. If you don't wanna help,spit it out already."


Geez! Such a really bad temper for someone in need of help.


"Fine. Let's say I don't wanna help you, then."

 To my surprise, Jace stood up to leave.



Goodness!


"Please, just sit." I grabbed his hand.


"No,Lyric. If this guy really needs my help, he's going to have to ask nicely. With the right attitude."


I glanced at Kael. Not sure that's ever going to happen.But...



"Kael, come on. Just try to be the bigger man."I made my eyes as pleading as they could.



I needed to get this done and focus on my celebration.



"Are you trying to say I'm the smaller person here,Lyric?" Jace huffed.



"No..."



"Fine! Please, just sit and let's talk," Kael said,surprising the hell out of me. I think even Jace was shocked.



Wow. He did have some pide to drop.



Jace still gave him that unsatisfied look before plonking back into his seat.


Picking up his glass of wine, he grumped. "Make it quick."



JARIS



Today was stressful but productive. I got to close some really nice deals, which meant more money and visibility. Not that I needed more money, actually.


Nerion was driving me back to the Pack house when I got a call from Luca-one of the representative from the Central Pack.



"Jaris. You said you wanted to know if anything came up in the course of the investigation, concerning the King's death."



"Yes? Have you found something?" My interest was already piqued.


Since I showed interest in the Alpha King's Throne,they'd been treating me with more respect.



"We took our time cross checking the CCTV footage,and just this morning, we discovered something new.For better clarification, I just forwarded the footage to you."


I eagerly checked my email on my laptop and played the video. Luca explained what I was watching.


"On the day King Thaddeus died, we had some men bring in supplies to the storage room. We do this twice a month. Now, if you look closely, among the men offloading the truck, there's one with the black face cap."



I could see him. He wasn't the only one wearing a face cap,but he was the only one who consciously avoided the cameras.



"He keeps avoiding the cameras, so we can't get a view of his face," Luna confirmed my thoughts. "And even in the house, when they took the goods to the storage,he did well to hide his face."



It was as if he knew where each camera was because he successfully avoided every one of them.


"Now, when the people were done and leaving, this very man was not with them."



I watched the men get into the truck and leave.


Luca was right. The creep didn't get in with them.


"So,he stayed back somewhere?" | frowned.


"Looks like he did. And on that very night, the King ended up dead."



Fucker.



"Have you checked the cameras surrounding the other exits? Do we know when and how he left?""No. And we find it a bit strange that the cameras didn't capture him leaving that day or the next. Initially,we thought he might be here somewhere. So we turned every room upside down, but there was nothing.He's not here."



Then,how did he leave?


"I think he knows something," I tapped the screen.


"He sure does. We've already captured the delivery agency. Every one of the men that had been here on that day are here in our dungeon. But none of them seem to know anything about this guy. According to them, he showed up, asking for a quick job for money.They claim they didn't know he had ulterior motives."



I thought about it for a moment. "Keep them there.I'll come over tomorrow and question them myself.See if we can get anything out of them."


Luca paused. He probably knows it'd be hell if I get to interrogate them myself. But it was needed. I smelt something fishy. Something serious had to be done to uncover the truth.



"Alright, Jaris. We'll be expecting you."



| dropped the call but couldn't get my eyes off the man on the screen. I let my finger graze it There was something about him. Something familiar.



I felt this unwelcomed chill run down my spine and forced myself to shut the laptop.



We have to find him.

###Chapter 54 

LYRIC



By some miracle, Jace and Kael managed to have a conversation without throwing words at each other.Although, the hostility was still very clear.



I excused myself when they were deep into the conversation so I could call Alpha Zarek, but he didn't take my calls.



He didn't have my contact, right? So, he shouldn't know it was me calling.



At night, the kids came over to my room to spend some time with me. Marta was working in TCH through the night. So, they stayed with me for a long time,played and eventually slept over.







It was noon of the following day when Jace called and asked me to meet him somewhere outside Darkspire.



Unlike Jace, he didn't sound cheerful but rather pissed.He ended the call as soon as he delivered the message, and I had to hurry over to meet him.



I parked my car next to his by the road side. He came out of his,same time I did.


"Jace. Is there-" My words were cut off when I saw how angry he looked.



If it wasn't for the fact that I trusted him, I'd have retreated.



"What did you do, Lyric?" He growled.



What?



When he marched toward me,I finally found myself retreating until my back was against my car.



"Jace! What is wrong with you?"



"Answer me! What did you do!?" His eyes were like daggers.


"I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't do anything!"



What was wrong with him?



He glared down at me. His eyes softened a smidge and it dawned on me. He wasn't just angry. He was concerned.



"Jace, talk to me. What is going on?" My heart was thumping in against my chest now.



Reaching for his phone in his back pocket, he tapped on the screen a few times before showing it to me.



On the screen was a picture of me. Old me. With the scar.



I was confused.



That picture wasn't taken. It looked like someone who was very skilled had drawn it. It looked exactly like the old me with my scar.


"While I was overseas," Jace started. "I got a connection to a hunt group called The Agents. Their existence is not often talked about because they keep a very low profile. But they hold a strong power over the werewolf world. They know when things are wrong and punish those responsible. Most times, they kill them. They're commonly known as the Executioners.


"I had to leave when I saw how demanding the job was. They're dangerous, Lyric. And rightnow,they're after you." He tapped the screen. "The old you.They're out to kill you."


My mouth hung open in shock, fear eating me from the inside out.



Gods,please. It couldn't be true.



"I have tried to ask around to know what you did,but I can't get anything. Like I said, they keep a low profile and I'm even lucky I got to see this. So, I am asking you, Lyric." He stepped closer to her. "What the fuck did you do?"


I turned around to hold onto my car for support as my legs had become too weak to move. I was losing my mind.



And here I was, thinking it was over. Thinking I'd escaped it.



"Lyric!" Jace snapped. "These people only want you dead when you've done something terrible. Something unforgivable. And believe me, they know how to hunt well. It won't take long before they find you. Your life is in danger!"



"| know!" I whirled around to meet him. "But what do you want me to do, Jace? I'm scared!"


"Well,you can start by telling me what you did to get them on your tracks. Tell me the truth."



I shook my head, my fear heightening. "I-I can't."



"Damn it, Lyric! Say something."


I felt cold liquid against my cheeks. Tears.


It was a secret I'd been harbouring for years. Jace was my best friend, but I didn't want to tell anyone what I'd done. I was so afraid. "They won't find me," I sniffled, dabbing my face."They're after the old me. They won't know it is me."



"Are you kidding?" He huffed, making me look stupid."They're already in Flodiria. Who knows how long it'd take before they get you. You might have gotten rid of your scar, Lyric, but people like your family still know it's you. What happens when The Executioners run into someone that knows you and discover who you are?"


He was right. Shit, of course he was right.


"S-So, what do I do, Jace?" A tremor ran through my voice.



Jace gave me an angry stare. "You really won't tell me what you did,right?"


I lowered my gaze. I wanted to confide in someone,but I was so scared of the truth growing wider.


"Fine.You have to run." Jace said with finality.



"What?"



"It's the only option, Lyric. You have to go into hiding.They obviously know you're a wolf. So, they're looking at all the wolf packs. It'd be better if you go far away to a human country where they can't find you. You need to leave, Lyric. Right now." "No." I shook my head, my heart clenching painfully "I cannot leave, Jace. Not now."



Not when I stillhad a lot to do. Xylon was still very sick. Leaving now would be like abandoning him.



Jace held my shoulders, shaking me. "This is the only way, Lyric! Or would you rather stay back and get yourself killed? Would that be better?"



I shook my head.


No. I didn't want to die.



"I'll help you, Lyric." Jace's voice softened. "I know of a nice place you could hide. I'll take you there."


Tears streaked my cheeks as I thought of how ruined my life was about to become. I was about to lose everything.

###Chapter 55
JARIS



"Feel free to tell me about it. Everything, Jaris," Nivia said,her voice alone sounding soothing.



Few days ago, if someone had told me I'd be seeking out Nivia for help, I'd have punched them in the nose.


She was a popular psychological doctor.People came to her when they were passing through things they could not understand.



Being over sixty years old, Nivia was very experienced and well respected in our world. People say she had answers to every psychological problem.



I stood facing the window, my hand in my trouser pocket as I told her my problem.


"For more than fifteenyears, I have not been able to cum." Except that one time, five years ago. But l didn't mention that. "I am hardly even aroused or interested in a woman. But a week ago, I saw someone naked. And that very night, I came to the image of it."I shook my head. "I have not been able to get it off my mind. Worse, I keep cumming to that very image."
I did not have any fear of sharing this with Nivia. She was well known for keeping things confidential. What was said in her room remains in her room.



"Are we talking about a man or a woman?" She asked from where she was seated behind me.



"A woman."



"I see." I saw her bob through the reflection in the window.



"Tell me, Alpha; how exactly do you feel when you see this woman?"


Her question took me by surprise. I realized that I had never actually thought of it.


"I don't know," I shrugged. "She's beautiful. A lot of men are attracted to her. And...each time I see her with them, it gets on my nerves."



"So,you like her?"



"| don't," | snapped.


She betrayed me. I couldn't care for someone like her.


Nivia gave me a long stare. I caught her staring through the glass.


"What did she do to upset you, Alpha?" She wore a small smile. "It is obvious you are trying to deny your feelings because she hurt you."



I turned to her, letting her see the seriousness in my eyes as I said my next words. "I feel nothing for that woman. Honestly,all I want is to get rid of that image because I hate that they have such an effect on me."


She sighed as she looked down at her book where she scribbled something.



"Well, there is only one explanation for this. If this woman has this hold over you, it's only because she's your fated mate."



My countenance dropped. The words hit me, making me silent for a moment.



"That is not possible. I already have a fated mate."


Greta. That was my mate's name.


We'd already met eight years ago. But unfortunately,she went missing. Or maybe, ran away. She was terrified when she learned we were mates. She had always been afraid of I and my family. Although,mother had been doing all she could to find her so she could take her rightful place as my Luna.


It wasn't possible to have two fated mates. I thought they said Nivia was the best? 
"Only a fated mate can do something like this, Alpha,"she insisted. "Your wolf likes her. It welcomes her.That can only happen when it's your fated mate."



I never should've come to Nivia, because all she did was make things more complicated for me.


"It's not possible to have two fated mates." I grabbed my jacket from the arm of the chair I'd been sitting on."I'm afraid you were not helpful."



LYRIC



As soon as I reached Darkspire, I started packing up my bags. The plan was to leave at midnight when no one would see me.



Jace and I already agreed to meet up at the outskirts of Darkspire.



I hated that I was doing this. Hated that I was leaving everything behind. But Jace was right. It wasn't safe anymore.


I was nearly done with my bags when a hurried knock came on my door. I startled before going to get it.


It turned out to be one of the kids' nanny.



"I'm sorry. Their mother isn't around and-and I don't know who else to call. It's Xylon," she stuttered, her forehead damp with sweat.


My heart was in my throat as I ran to the kids' room
On the floor was Xylon, shaking profusely.



Please,no!



He was having another crisis.


But this one seemed worse. He had blood running through his nose.



Xyla was beside him, weeping profusely.


I forced myself to stay calm as I knelt beside him and told the nannies what to gather for me.



While the nannies hurried to get them, I lifted Xylon's head onto my legs and rubbed circles on his back and chest.



"It's fine. You'll be fine."



Half an hour later, Xylon was completely fine.Although, he was very weak and had his head on my legs.I managed to convince him to eat something. So,the nannies had gone to get them.



"I'm sorry," he muttered weakly, stupefying me.


Huh? "For what?"



"Bothering you." He was struggling to keep his eyes open.


Tears pooled in my eyes as I looked at his pitiful face.I sniffled and forced a chuckle. "Don't be silly, Xylon.There's nothing to be sorry for. It is my duty,remember?"



His eyes didn't open. I quickly checked his pulse and was relieved he was just sleeping.


'He's fine. There's nothing to worry about,' I told myself.



A tear dropped to my cheek. And another,until I was completely sobbing.


Gods, I couldn't leave him. Not when he was like this.Not when he was suffering this much.


I didn't care about my safety anymore. I was ready to stay back and help him, even if it meant losing my life.


****



I stayed longer with the kids and only left when they were both sleeping.



I was tired as I walked back to my room. I'd have to call Jace and tell him about the change of plan.



I paused when I got to my room and found the door open. Someone had been here. Or was still here. I went in, and to my surprise, it wwas Jaris. He was there in the center of the room, leaning against the dresser.


For a moment, I was relieved that it was just him and not some unwanted intruder. But my relief was short -lived when I noticed the anger in his eyes. And worse of it all, I knew the reason he was that way.


Before him were my bags, all packed and lined up.



He knows I was trying to leave.
###Chapter 56
LYRIC



And here I was, thinking this day couldn't get any worse for me.



I nervously twiddled with the fabric of my shirt, trying to conjure the best possible lies in my head. I was already in too much mess with Jaris to add this to it.


"Care to explain?" His voice was stone cold.



Goodness,he was beyond pissed.



My lips moved, but no words formed.


"Were you trying to run away?" He took a step toward me.



"No. I promise, it's not what you think."


"It's not what I think." He chuckled. "Well, your bags are here on the floor, all packed up. And it's night. So,maybe you want to explain what's going on."


Shit. He was never supposed to see this. No one was.I'd left the room in a hurry and didn't think I'd be that unfortunate. "What is wrong with you!?" He growled. "First, you do unexplainable things, and now this? You're trying to run away from our contract? Why? Do you have someone you'd rather be with? Have you had a lover all along?"


He glared at me like he had a name at the of his tongue.


"Please," I said rather wearily. "I know what it looks like, but I wasn't trying to flee."


Of course, he had every reason to suspect me.It did look like I was trying to flee. But how do I explain to him that I'd changed my mind? How do I even explain why I'd been trying to flee in the first place? It wouldn't make any sense.



Jaris was so pissed. He looked at me like I'd betrayed him. It was almost like that night at the temple when he glared at me like I was his enemy.


"And here I was, thinking you cared for my kids. For my son," he said low, his voice filled with disappointment. "We had an agreement for you to help them. Yet, you're willing to run away just for some other selfish interest."



No. I wasn't going to let him do this to me. His kids were the reason I was staying. I was risking my life for them! "I love your kids! They're the reason you still met me here!" | snapped.


His eyes darkened. "So, you do admit that you were trying to flee, then."


Shit! The emotional manipulation dawned on me when it was too late. Ugh! Jaris was a vermin.



He took my phone from my table, surprising me. Then,he walked past me, going toward the door.


"What do you need my phone for?" I asked,confused,but he didn't even look at me.



"I'm-I'm really sorry. It's not what you think."|couldn't believe I was apologizing to him for something.



Yes, I was wrong. But he'd hurt me as well and didn't even bother to explain himself like I have.


He didn't say a word as he reached the door, pulled out my key and walked out the front.



Hold on.



"Wh-What're you doing?"



His eyes were icier as they pinned me with a glare."Punishing  you. Keeping you locked here so you never think of this stupid idea, ever again."
No! He couldn't be serious!



"You can't do that to me." I started toward the door,but it was slammed shut in my face, and I heard the sound of the key going in next.


I turned the knob but the door wouldn't open. I was really trapped in here.


"Open the door!" I hit my palms against it, repeatedly "I'm not your prisoner! You can't do this to me!"


But no response came. Instead, I heard his receding footsteps.



****+****+



For two whole days, I was locked in my room by Jaris.


I didn't have access to my phone to call anyone, so l was stuck here at his will.


The only time I got to see people was when the maids came with food and drinks, and each time, there would be two guards at the door, making sure I didn't try to leave. They wouldn't even talk to me. I guess Jaris must have warned them not to so I wouldn't try to talk my way out of here.



I was frustrated and losing my mind. But I couldn't say I was  surprised. Everyone had always talked about Jaris being an emotionless monster. Unfortunately,I didn't have a choice in this stupid contract.



When I heard the door going open in the evening,I figured it'd be one of the maids bringing me some snacks or something. Surprisingly, I was well taken care of. But it didn't change the fact that | was a prisoner, and I hated it.


Unexpectedly, I found Jace walking through the door.Surprise filled my lungs in the form of a gasp.



"Jace?"



He opened his arms and I ran right in, feeling like an abandoned wolf who was finally meeting her family


"How-How did you get access?" Jaris wouldn't let me see anyone.


Just then, I caught Kael by the door.


"The bastard owed me a favour," Jace clarified



Oh.



"And that bastard is gonna fuck you up if you don't make it quick," Kael grumped.


Jace tilted himself so he could face Kael. "I really pity you when you have too much confidence in yourself.You can't fuck me up, dude. Get lost." "Right. You keep saying that and someday, you mnight learn the hard way." Kael shut the door.


I shook my head. These two could never agree.


"Thank you for coming to see me," my eyes were sad despite the smile I forced on my face.


"What the fuck is going on, Lyric? You never showed up, and I couldn't even reach you on phone. And when I came here, that fucker told me you were locked up.Good thing he owed me a favor."



I turned away from Jace, sinking my fingers into my hair. I told him what happened; how Jaris had caught me leaving. As expected, he was enraged.


"And so fucking what? You're not his slave, Lyric. He has no right to lock you up," he fumed.


"It's actually a breach of contract." He has the right to do worse to me.


"Please, spare me. This is nonsense. I could talk to my father."



"Jace,please don't. I don't wanna complicate things."


I sat down on the edge of the bed, staring at my non -manicurerd nails.


"| actually don't want to leave again. I just didn't have the time to tell you that night.



Jace looked at me like I'd just told him | was committing suicide.



"What're you saying, Lyric? Don't be stupid! These people are on your tail and will kill you when they find you. You can't be serious about staying back."


"I can't leave the kids, Jace! On that night, while I was gathering my bags, the boy had one of his crises again.This time, it was worse. If I hadn't been there to save him..." I shook my head, a chill running down my spine from the mental image of how much Xylon would've suffered.



"I'm sorry, but I'll never be able to bear it if something happens to that boy when I could've been there to save him. That would have been selfish of me."



Jace's voice was softer now. "Lyric, it's not selfish if you're trying to survive."


"I-I know. But I need to be there for him."


Right now, it was beyond what Jaris and I shared. Jaris and Marta aside, the kids had become my friends and I wanted to be there for them.
###Chapter 57
LYRIC



Jace sat next to me, his shoulders slumped in defeat.


"At least, tell me what you did, Ly. Why are these people after you? I need to understand how I can help."


I exhaled a long breath. He was right. If I needed his help,he should know what I did.


It was terrifying that I had to say this. I was letting out a very big secret, but I didn't have a choice.


"Three years ago, I was in Mystopia." It was where l met Penelope and had my twins. But I didn't mention that to Jace. It wasn't important.


"I got a job in a hospital, but I was under training and supervision. I hardly interacted with the patients there.Then, I noticed that the few times I did, the patients could easily get better." I bit my lip, hesitating for what I was to say next. "One day, I stumbled upon a certain room. Before then, I'd noticed that room was always locked, and not everyone could be granted access into it. But on that very day, the door was open.So,I went in and found a young man on the bed. "He was asleep, his face pale. He was in a coma." I still got the chills as I remembered what it felt like.



"I was curious to know what was wrong with him. But I also suspected that this man was someone important who the others had been hiding. I went forward-stupid me-and I-I touched him. I don't know;maybe I just wanted to know how cold or hot he was.But as soon as we made skin contact, he came awake.



"I was scared and quickly stepped back. And it was in that moment that my supervisor-Winnie-came into the room. The man went back to sleep again,looking pale like he didn't just open his eyes. My supervisor was very mad at me that day and even threatened to get me fired.



"But the next day, she called me to her officeand asked how l'd been able to pull him awake. She asked me if I could try to make him wake permanently.I wasn't sure of what I could do yet, but when she promised me a lot of money-which I needed-l agreed to give it a try.


"I was led on what to get for the man. I held his hand much longer, and to my surprise, he did wake up. But I didn't stay for long to hear what he and my supervisor said."


I shook my head, feeling guilty and stupid. "I don't know, but I think I made a terrible mistake, Jace. Something in me keeps screaming that that man was dangerous and was supposed to stay asleep. I don't even know how I had the power to wake him up. But..."I swallowed around the lump in my throat. This was the scarier part of the story. "The following day,my supervisor ended up dead."


I could still recall the fear I'd felt when the news reached me that she had been killed.



"Nobody knew who was responsible, but | realized that there was trouble. I had a gut feeling it had to do with the man that was awake. So, I ran. I ran to a different city and... with my discovery of my abilities,I worked on my scar and got them removed."I shrugged. "That's pretty much wvhat happened."



Jace was speechless for some time. He exhaled,wiping his hands against his face and propping them in his knees.


"Goodness, Lyric. You must've done something really dangerous. That man was clearly a prisoner, and you just released him when he was supposed to stay imprisoned."


My throat turned to dust. The more I realized I was wrong,the scarier it got. "I-I didn't know. And when my supervisor told me to-"


"Yeah, before she ended up dead," Jace cut me off. "No wonder they're after you. They want you to pay for what you did,just like her."



I buried my face in my palms, cold crushing my bones "|I don't know what to do, Jace. How do I mak<e them understand it wasn't intentional?"



Jace was silent for a couple of minutes. "Have you...tried to understand what you are?"



I lifted my face to look at him. "I have. Apparently, we have this thing in our family where some of us are gifted with these special healing abilities."



"I know. But don't you think yours is quite different?"


He was damn right. I'd been concerned about that as well.



Jace chuckled before revealing the heart-shattering truth. "Lyric, you're a Siphon."



My head spun.



"| d-I don't understand."



"It's obvious! You have this knowledge of what could work for everyone, and the healing process occurs only completely when you make contact with them."



I couldn't agree any less. The first instinct in me when I see a sick person is to touch them. I always had this feeling that they'd be better as soon as I touch them.


"You're not healing them through the normal way you know. You're siphoning their sicknesses from their body to yours. Only difference is, your body has been made for things like this. So, you don't feel it." He stood up,lifting and falling his hands. "Do you fucking know how special that is? We haven't seen a Siphon in hundreds of years!"


My stomach churned with dread.


No. It couldn't be. I loved being different, but not Siphon-kind of different.


"J-Jace, what do l do?" A tremor ran through my quiet voice as I stood up. I'd never been more scared in a long time. "I can't be a Siphon. I don't want to be!"



"Oh, girlfriend." Jace shook his head. There was no fun in his eyes. Just worry for me. "You already are.And the Executioners already know, which is the reason they're going all out to hunt you."



Siphons were more of a curse than a blessing in our world. They were forbidden, and every Siphon that had been born in the past was always killed.



"You do realize how dangerous you are, don't you?"Jace took my hands. "You could hurt people, Ly.Destroy people. You can siphon so much, not justa person's sickness." He looked down at our hands joined together. "If you focus, you can actually siphon oxygen out of me and I'll drop dead. You can siphon emotions, my reasoning, and even my memory!" He huffed, shaking his head. "Your kind has always been forbidden because you could do things that aren't allowed."



"But I didn't ask to be this!" My voice was filled with agony. "I don't want to be this, Jace. I don't want to be this dangerous to people."



I lowered my head, a tear slipping down. "I'm so scared,Jace."



"Hey," he cooed, coming closer and taking my hands again. "I know you, Ly. You're the sweetest defenseless girl I know. You won't want to hurt anyone.That's how I know you've got this."


More tears streaked down my cheeks as I looked at him. "But if the others get to know... I'll be dead."


"You won't. I won't let that happen." He squeezed my hands. "We'll both protect this secret with our lives,and I'll make sure no harm comes to you."

###Chapter 58

LYRIC


"Thank you," I whimpered, and he pulled me into a hug.


After a while, we disengaged as he stated an important point. "First things first, you have to stay as hidden as possible, Ly. I was super glad when you told me about the job at TCH, but you can't keep drawing attention to you by doing things others can't."


My heart sank. I'd seen this coming. I just didn't think I'd really hear of it.


"Only Siphons can do things others can't. And if you keep doing this, you'll draw attention to you until someone who knows what you are,figures you out.It won't also be long when the Executioners find you.You have to avoid trouble as much as you can. Alright?"


I sniffled as I nodded. It was going to be so hard. And here I was, happy that I'd gotten a job and I was going to save lives. How unfortunate that my gift turned out to be a curse.



****十＊＊＊＊十

I should have been here yesterday. But due to unforeseen circumstances, my trip was delayed.


I walked into the Central Palace and met with Luca at the entrance. He was happy to have me there and led me in with some other men that had been waiting.


We talked about a little on our way until we reached the prison gates where the men from the delivery agency were locked up.


The men looked pale and exhausted, and they shifted on their asses when they saw me.


"Which of them is the Manager?" | asked Luca while I kept my gaze on the men.


"The one at the far end." Luca pointed at him.



"Bring him to the interrogation room."



I did not miss the fear that crossed the man's face. He must feel like the most unluckiest man in the world.



I walked away to the interrogation room, and seconds Later, the large man was brought in to me.



He was placed on the chair opposite mine,although was standing. I intended to make this quick.


"Now, listen," I rolled up my sleeves. "I intend to make this as quick as possible. You're human, which means it'd be more than easy to break you. I don't even have to do much, and there's a high tendency you might not survive it."



The large man shuddered uncomfortably in his seat.He looked like someone that was bossy on a normal day, yet here he was, chained and trembling in the presence of another.



Quite pathetic.



"Please, we've told them everything we know.Honestly, if I could turn back the hands of time, I never would've given that cocksucker a job."He was angry as much as he was scared.



"Which brings us to the question," now, I took my seat. "When you were leaving, didn't you notice you were short of one member? I don't know about you,but I find it too convenient for that young man that none of you noticed he was missing."


"We-We did. But not at the moment. We didn't notice he was missing from the truck before we left,we only did when we had hit the road."



I waited for him to continue. "And?"



"I'm-I'm sorry, it may sound unprofessional, but I decided not to care. We thought, maybe, he must've been in a restroom when we left and was stuck behind.But we figured he'd find his way out." I nodded, despite the rage seething in my blood. If only they'd made sure. We wouldn't be here.


"Like I said," I tsked. "Too convenient for him."


I started with the torture, dragging some ugly cries out of him. But he didn't release any more information.



It took him passing out to get me to stop, then l realized he was telling the truth. It also made sense because they were a big agency. They wouldn't intentionally help someone kill the King and not try to run, at least. They must have been used.


Besides, an assassin with a mission as powerful as that would be smart enough to deceive people like that.



"So, what do we do next?" Luca asked as we both walked out of the interrogation room. "If we can't get the answers out of these guys, the murderer will go scoff free."



I was still bothered about something else. How did the assassin leave the palace?



I stopped walking and turned to him. "Can I watch the footage again? I need to check something."


A few minutes later, I was seated in the security office,going through all the footage surrounding the time of the King's death. The assassin never came to the Palace until he did with those men.



So,how did he leave?



I had a hint.



I went to the footage of the day of the King's funeral.I checked the surroundings. It took me a long time,but in the end, I got my answer.



"There he is!" Luca exclaimed beside me. "The asshole left during the funeral! When everyone was distracted and away from the Palace."



I glanced at him in surprise. Luca was a sixty year old man who had always been modest. Hearing him use words like 'asshole' was new to me.



In the footage, the assassin knew he stood a higher chance being caught if he tried to leave right after he murdered the king. So, he hid around somewhere in the Palace while nobody suspected there was even in an assassin in the house.



Then, he waited for the day of the funeral when everyone's attention was at the funeral hall. It was easier sneaking out then. The son of a bitch knew what he was doing.



"He must have been feeding and drinking during his stay here," I murmured as I watched more footage.



Unfortunately, there were no cameras inside the main palace. King Thaddeus always felt like it was an invasion of privacy. So, only the surroundings had cameras to see who goes in and out.


"Do you think someone might have been feeding him?Helping him?" Luca asked.



"Possibly. Or late at night, he'd crawl to the kitchen to steal food."



I clenched my jaw as I studied him climb out the fence on the funeral night. He was still very careful to protect his face from the camera.



"I have a feeling this guy must have had some sort of experience about the Palace," Luca said the exact words I had in mind. "The way he knew where the cameras were supposed to be, where to hide without being seen, and how to get food and drinks. A novice within these walls would've been caught. This guy must be something else."



I nodded in agreement. Luca had never been more accurate.



Our assassin was no stranger within these walls. So,there was a good chance King Thaddeus had been staring into the familiar face of his assassin when he got killed. Luca and I spoke some more on the topic, deciding to carry out more investigations and sweep the city for our guy.


When I left and was in the backseat of my car,headed home,I made a call I hadn't made in years. A call that was always unnerved me whenever I had to make it.


The issue of the assassin and how familiar he looked was making me uneasy. I just needed to be very sure.


The woman picked up when the call was about to end."Alpha Jaris. Greetings."



As always, her tone was clipped.


"Margaret. You know why I'm calling. Is he still there?"I demanded.



"Yes, of course. He's still locked up and asleep." After a heartbeat, she added;"you know you have nothing to worry about. Your brother is not getting out of here."
###Chapter 59
LYRIC



My appetite left with Jace after our painful conversation.



I was scared, and a tiny voice in my head kept mocking me that I might not be alive for very long.


I heard my door unlocking and snapped upright,waiting to see who'd enter.



It hadn't been long since the maids brought me food.So,who was-



Oh.



My thoughts took a pause. Swallowing hard, I rose to my feet as Jaris made his way in.


He was still wearing something corporate,which meant he must just be making his way home.But it was almost midnight. Why was he just coming back?


'It's none of your business, Lyric.'


"Good evening," I murmured.


It was the first time he was coming to see me since he locked me up. I couldn't believe he could be so cruel to do this to me.



I noticed his eyes linger on the tray of my untouched meal. He didn't seem pleased.


"Why haven't you eaten?" He asked coldly


"Nothing. Just didn't have the appetite."


"Seriously?" He huffed. "You're not eating so you can lie to people that I starved you."


I looked at him with disbelief. "I really don't get why you assume I'm a liar." I have never lied to you!



He said nothing, but his expression didn't get any softer.


He ambled toward the table, leaning against it.


He folded his brawny arms across his chest, and I forced myself not to look at how good it was.



"Why were you trying to run?" His voice was less scolding, more like he was curious. "Aside our contract,you were supposed to treat Xylon.I thought you liked the kids. Were you really going to abandon him just because of our differences?"



I shook my head. He really thought I was trying to flee because we were at loggerheads? Oh, he knew nothing.


"I'm sorry," I scratched my hairline with the tip of my finger. "I promise you, it's not what you think. I wasn't trying to flee because of our differences." I hated the fact that I was explaining myself and apologizing when few weeks ago, he had hurt me as well and didn't do anything to make me feel better.


"| know you might not believe it, but Xylon is the reason you caught me in the first place. And I intend to stay and finish my job on him." I chuckled. "I can't abandon a soul like that. Never."



For a long moment, he watched me with those accessing eyes of his. Those eyes that made me feel like I was being investigated.


"Why don't you tell me where you were headed,then?I deserve to know."



Okay. I've had enough.


"Can we just put this behind us?" My voice was a little serious. "I'm sorry, okay? Sorry I tried to flee. Sorry you caught me. I promise, it'll never happen again.Honestly, I'm just tired of this conversation."


His eyes darkened. "You think you have the right to be tired? I deserve an explanation, Lyric Harper!"


"Well, at least, I have and I've apologized! You didn't do any of these on our mating night. You embarrassed me in front of friends and family! At least, I haven't done any of that to you!"



He moved from the table, stepping towards me with eyes burning like hot coals.



This was my warning to keep shut. My warning to tell me I was crossing the line. But I'd been carrying this hurt with me for weeks!



I took a step back when he kept getting closer Eventually, I stood my ground, despite the fear clawing deep in my stomach.


We stood almost feet to feet, his dark eyes pinning mine.



"You know nothing, Lyric," his voice was like an ice cube. "You know nothing of the embarrassment you brought to me."



What? My voice was barely audible.


He turned away, heading for the door.



"If I did something, why don't you just tell me!?Because as far as I'm concerned, I'm the only one who has been your victim here!"


He didn't stop. Didn't look at me. "If you hated me this much, you shouldn't have brought the damn contract to me. My life is more hell than It's ever been!"



Of course, that was not true. But I was furious and not thinking straight.


He walked out the door, but I didn't hear the locks.


I hesitated for a moment before going closer. What.I turned the knob, the door opened. And more to my surprise, the key was right there on the keyhole.


He didn't lock me in. Did that mean I was free?



****+****+



JACE



Jace impatiently glanced at his time for what felt like the millionth time.



If there was one thing he hated, it was having to wait for anyone.



He picked his phone and keys to leave when Kael finally arrived.



"Fuck, man! You're late!" He hissed.



Kael remained calm as he took his seat, facing Jace's. "How ironic," the corner of his lips tilted up in a smile."A few days ago it was me begging to see you. Now,it's the other way around."


"You must have vocabulary problems because I didn't fucking beg," Jace forced himself not to growl. "Why were you so late? You were supposed to be here ten minutes ago."


"Dude, I know you have the brain of a child and all,but there's something called traffic. Besides, you only waited for ten minutes. Don't act like a lady hasn't kept you waiting for longer."


"No. People don't keep me waiting. It's forbidden in my rules."


Kael simply huffed as he reached for his half cup of wine and drank from it.



"Now, why the fuck would you do that?" Jace slammed his hands on the table, although it was light."Your stupid lips just kissed my glass."


He clicked his fingers toward a waitress, requesting for an extra glass.



"You're an ass. You should be thankful someone like me getsto kiss your glass. From the look of things,I don't think you get such privileges often." "Yeah,you wish."



Kael chuckled and emptied the drink.



Jace was always unnerved by this guy. He could act very cold, his mind capable of delivering the greater evil.



"Now, why did you call for me?" Kael asked as he dropped his empty glass on the table.



The waitress arrived with Jace's new glass which he started filling with the wine.



"I need your help."


"It's obvious. You wouldn't call me here for any other reason.Please,refill my glass."


Jace gave him the death glare. "I'm not your boy.You've got hands. Do it yourself."



"I fucking said please! How're you even the chairman's son? You're the complete opposite of what your father is. Seriously, I think I need to talk to him to change his son."


"And you? Do you even have a father I can talk to?"


Kael chuckled, although Jace didn't miss the dark glint in his eyes. "Look, you better fill that glass or I'm out of here." 
Jace growled low in the throat. He wished he could punch this guy so hard he wouldn't heal. But he was right. He did need his help.



Grudgingly, he refilled his glass and slid it to him.


He kept his gaze on Kael as he drank from it. "Careful.I might've poisoned it."



"Oh, you wouldn't dare."



Kael brought the wine to half before setting it down on the table.



"Okay. So,what help are we talking about?"

###Chapter 60
JACE



Jace adjusted in his seat. This was the real deal.



"I need you to help me move into Darkspire."



If Kael hadn't swallowed the drink he had in his mouth already,he'd have spilled it all over the table.



He wouldn't have been as shocked if Jace had told him he wanted to take down a certain Alpha. But moving in to Darkspire? To a different Pack? It was beyond ridiculous.



For Jace, it was very important. He was worried about Lyric and someone discovering her secret.He took the night they were supposed to elope as an instance.She had been caught and locked up by Jaris, yet he had no idea.If something bad were to happen to her while he was far away,he wouldn't have any idea until it was too late.



He needed to be close to her.



"Please, tell me you're drunk," Kael scoffed. "That's the only reasonable explanation for this madness."



"I wouldn't invite you here to drink from my glass if | wasn't serious. I'm damn serious about this, Kael."


"Well, you sound crazy. I'm not letting you into Darkspire. That's not possible."


"Why?" Jace leaned closer to the seat. "According to the laws of our Packs, a Pack is required to receive guests at anytime. Not accepting me would be discrimination and breaking the rules."



"A Pack is required to receive guests who are important and have a valid reason to be there.What is your reason,tell me. To stay close to the Alpha's mate?"



"No." Jace rubbed his hand against his face. "Believe me,Kael. Lyric and I could never be anything beyond friends. She's like a sister to me. And believe me,if l wanted her before Jaris did, I'd have gotten her. She doesn't want me either. As a matter of fact," he sighed, his face growing serious. "Lyric has never crossed my mind in that light."



Kael gave him one of his cold assessing looks. It was a look Jace hated, but it also meant he was confident his words.



"Well, let's assume you're telling the truth," he drank from his glass again. "I can't get you into Darkspire.You need to have a solid reason."



"Seriously, this is important. Lyric... she's been getting into a lot of trouble lately and needs ms around to "As much as I want to admire how protective you are as her friend, you still need a valid reason to come to Darkspire. Alpha Jaris won't approve of it unless it makes sense."



"Well, let's come up with one. Because l fucking need this to happen."


****十米米来米十



LYRIC



It was a new day. Yet, it came with the same burden.


I looked pale in the mirror, staring at my reflection wearing black corporate pants with a black top tucked into it, and my new favorite red lipstick.


Maybe I'd have looked stunning if I didn't look so sad.


On my dresser was my phone with the text clearly displayed:


"We were expecting you yesterday, Mrs. Dreadmoor.We hope we get to see you today. Please, do get back to us."


Since I discovered who I really was,I'd been troubled and contemplated quitting my new job at TCH or not.

 Jace was right. I needed to stop using my powers for everyone to see.



But what I'd been able to do was so good. I got to give life to a man who didn't have much hope.I wished I could continue doing it.


So,last night, I concluded on one thing-I didn't need to use my powers to do good. I could simply heal them with my basic knowledge and help them get better.



Grabbing my things, I headed for my car, hit the road and drove to Botanical Bliss first.


There, I got a pair of abyssal gloves. It was made for similar purposes-very thick and creating a barrier between my hands and the other person's skin. This way, I won't be siphoning anybody's powers when l touch them.



It was painful that I had to keep this side of me locked,but it was for the best. The only person I had to take care of was Xylon, and everything would be fine.


I reached TCH and headed to Guinevere's office. The woman was on a phone call when I entered.


"Lyric. You're here." She dropped the landline.


"Good morning, ma'am." I dipped my head. 
"You're quite late, I must say."


"l-I know, and I'm so sorry. Certain things came up.I just-"



"It's fine. I'm just glad you're here. Today," she stood up. "I'll be needing you to attend to a very delicate case. This man is an old time and has done a lot of good in our world. Unfortunately, he was poisoned with Kaltis, resulting in a failed heart. He is quite old,hence not healing quickly. I know you just resumed,but I have this great confidence that you can do it."



I swallowed hard, my heart beating painfully in my chest.



I can do it.



Of course, I can. If I wasn't trying to hide my true self,it'd have been a piece of cake.



I smiled to Guinevere, anyway. "Okay, ma'am." Even though I knew it was a lie.


"Good. Come, dear. I'll show you to your office."


I could tell that Guinevere was a very strict woman,yet she's been friendly with me.



She took me to my office which was qute big,well furnished with proper lightings, and very beautiful. My heart melted at the name tab on the table. 'Dr. Lyric.'


I was a doctor. Oh, damn it!


A smile spread across my face.


"That's the landline over there, and there's a book containing the various codes. You let me know if you need anything. Starting today, you'll be getting a schedule on the patients you're to attend to. I wish you the best of luck, Lyric."


I dipped my head. "Thank you, ma'am."



"Please, it's Dr. Guinevere."


My cheeks flushed as I nodded.



"I'll be taking you to your first patient by one p.m.For now just stay settled in your office." Guinevere reached the door but suddenly slept when she remembered something. "And oh, there's someone that wishes to see you, Dr.Lyric."







Thirty minutes later, the 'someone' did come. It felt good receiving a visitor for the first time in 'my' office.


But my happiness fell flat when the visitor turned out to be Alpha Zarek. Relief and anger crushed through me at once. Relief because I'd been trying to reach him for days and failing. Anger because he and Marta probably knew something I didn't.



"Lyric." He wore a small smile as he strode into the office,taking a seat.



"Alpha Zarek," I cleared my throat. "What an unexpected visit."



"Yeah."



He looked around my office, as of accessing it. "Nice place. And congrats on the job."


I ignored it. "What're you doing here?"


"Well, I've been wanting to meet you for days nowN.I was told it was you who helped my father get better and I wanted to personally thank you for it. You did a good job."



All I did was nod.



"| also wanted to ask, is there something you'd need for-"



"I didn't do it for a favour,". I cut him off, already knowing where he was headed. "But yes, maybe there's something you could dofor me." Thank goodness the idea struck my mind.


"Okay. What is it?"


"On the ninth of this month, Marta and I were in a Garden, having a discussion then, she left and I passed out from my drink. But I noticed you came into that same garden while I was still in. Do you mind explaining to me what you were doing there?"
###Chapter 61 
LYRIC



For someone as hard as Zarek, it was easy to see when he was tensed and uncomfortable.



Unfortunately, he did a good job masking it as quickly as it came. But it wasn't quick enough to fool me.


"What're you insinuating, Lyric?" He chuckled



"Alpha Zarek," I placed my hands on the desk and interlocked my fingers. "Ifyou really want to return the favour for healing your father, you should tell me the truth. What were you doing there that night?"


His face grew tender, hinting at a buried truth. He was hiding something. It was so clear now.



"I wasn't doing anything," he shrugged, his face turning to rock once more. "I actually came with my mate and wanted to see if there was a vacancy in there. You know, that is my favorite spot. But you were already there, asleep. So, all I did was leave."


Disappointment stabbed me in the heart.



I held his gaze for some time before | lowered them to my desk, separating my fingers. "Is that so?"



"Yes." His voice was thick. "You could ask my mate if you want. She was in the car, waiting, while I wvent to check."



He stood up, his chair scraping against the floor."Once again, thank you for helping my father. If you do need anything else in return, let me know."



He was out the door before I could say anything else.Why did it look like he was running away? Why wasn't I satisfied?







By one p.m. Guinevere was there to take me to my first patient. I was so nervous.


On our way, she gave me a file and briefed me on what I was expected to do.



When we reached the surgical ward, I found the patient lying there, waiting for someone to save him.Someone who was suppress to be me.


From what I'd learned so far, his case was really delicate as he needed the poison extracted from his cavity area. It was really complex and a single error could result in him dying. It would be disastrous to have his death on my hands.A patient had never died on me before. I didn't want it happening now.


There was a team of doctors watching outside,including Marta who gave me that death glare.


| focused on the patient and what I was about to do.l doned my personal gloves which I got from my lab coat. The assistants and scrub nurses also got ready.


Everything was set, but my mind wasn't. I'd never performed such surgery before. Without my siphoning powers to help me, I was scared. What if he dies on me?



A scalpel was handed to me. Yet, for more than a minute, I simply stared at it without using it.


"Doctor Lyric. Is everything okay?" I heard someone ask from the window.



I was backing the window, so they couldn't see the uncertain look in my face.



I was scared. So so scared.



Finally,my body betrayed me. My legs jerked, forcing me to stumble back. The scalpel slipped from my hand to the floor. "Ma'am, are you alright?" The assistants in the room held me.



"Lyric?" Doctor Guinevere rushed in.


She put a hand around my shoulder. "What is wrong with you?"


"I-| ddon't know. I don't feel too well." I touched my forehead.



Guinevere did same. "My goodness, you're burning up."


I was. I couldn't believe anxiety could have this effect on me.



"Please, take her to the staff Quarters. She needs to rest," Guinevere said as she handed me to a nurse.



Pain and shame held me tight. I disappointed them.


How unfortunate.







The nurse had her hand around me as she led me away from the surgical ward.


Approaching a diversion, I heard someone sobbing in the corner.



"I just hope he makes it. All he ever wanted was to see his grandchild. He's waited years, you know? And now that I'm finally pregnant, he's about to die. How do l survive this?"



When we reached the corner, I saw a young lady crying in the arms of a man around her age Something in my guts told me she was connected to the man I just abandoned.



Agony clutched me tighter in the chest as I let the nurse lead me away.







HOURS LATER.



It was dark.



The day doctors, including Guinevere had left,replaced by the night doctors. I was supposed to have left hours ago, but when Guinevere asked, I told her l was staying back to do some research.



I was very nervous about what I was about to do. This could turn bad for me, but l've come to understand that I couldn't sit back and watch someone die when I could've done something.



It was exactly eight p.m when I left my office to Mr.Owen's ward. He was still in the surgical ward.



Doctor Guinevere had told me earlier not to worry, that arrangements had been made for another doctor to perform surgery on him very early tomorrow. But it was still a risk.



TCH had the best doctors, but there were certain things that were beyond them. Things that were beyond the physical control.


With their mere hands, Mr. Owen might or might not survive, but with me, I was sure he would. So, why let them take the risk?



Despite how scared I was myself, I went into the surgical ward and gathered the tools I needed.


The man was deep asleep. Thank goodness his family wasn't around either.



I donned the normal gloves and set to work, starting with a Dreamweaver elixir to make sure his sleep continues.



It was more stressful conducting the surgery alone,but in less than two hours, I was done.



I took a deep breath of relief when I confirmed his vitals were okay.


He was fine. The surgery was successful.


Yes! I screamed in my head. I did it! I wanted to laugh out loud. Wanted to run around,screaming my progress.


But it was quite sad that I couldn't do any of that.My win stayed with me and me alone.
###Chapter 62
I headed home feeling very happy. Feeling accomplished.





I headed to my room and paused when I found someone standing outside my door. The passage was dimly lit. So, I had to go closerto get a proper view of his face.



"Jace?" | stopped in my tracks, squinting my eyes.


He pushed off from the wall where he leaned, giving me that annoying smirk of his. "Yes, my hopeless child!It is l!"



I laughed as I ran into his arms. But our hug was brief.I needed answers.



"It's-It's late. What're you doing here?" And more importantly,how does he plan on getting home?


"Yes, it's late. So, mind telling me why you're just coming home?"


"Oh, shut up, dad." I rolled my eyes. "I have a job now.Back to my question. What're you doing here?"



"Well," he shrugged. "You staring at your newest neighbor.Open the door, Ly." Wait,what? "I don't understand." | scoffed. "Please,stop with your-"



"I'm not joking. I got Kael to help me. Although," he furrowed his brows. "I still don't know what he had to say to Jaris to let me move in here."


"Hold on, Jace. Why would you move in?"


"Why else? To watch over your careless ass. You'll be here for a year. Your life is in danger at the moment.So,I need to be here to protect you when the worst happens."



My heart melted from the revelation.


"Oh, Jace," I made a pout. "You really shouldn't have bothered. I'll be fine, I promise."


"That's the exact thing people say before they get into trouble. Come on, the door."



His hand on the back of my neck,he pushed me toward the door. I chuckled and opened it.


"So, you and Kael are cool now?" I asked as I worked the keyhole.


"The moon forbid it. I was almost forced to go on my knees to beg that asshole to listen to me. I wonder how people deal with him. His type are the ones we need less in the world."



I laughed as I walked into the dark room with Jace following. I turned on the lights.



"How was your first day at TCH?" My smile dropped as soon as he asked.


I hesitated, dropping my bag on the bed before going to the dresser to take off my wristwatch.


"Boring. I was asked to heal a man but couldn't."



I refused to tell him the rest, that I snuck out and later healed him. I didn't think Jace would appreciate that.


He tapped me on the shoulder. "It's for the best, Lyric.People have been surviving before you. Let's just leave it at that."



I flashed him a wistful smile before looking away.



"Marta was clearly happy with what happened."I rolled my eyes, recalling the annoying look she had in her face."If it wouldn't have been unprofessional, I'm sure she'd have laughed."



"Marta. Who's Marta?"



"A rude, tiring lady. Jaris' baby mama."



"Oh. The mother of his twins. She works at TCH?""Unfortunately. She's actually the head doctor in my department."



"Ooh." He clicked his tongue. "And considering the fact that you're Jaris' mate, I bet she'd really make life hell for you."



"She has. Fortunately, her kids are nothing like her.They're the sweetest things I've ever met. Their birthdays are actually coming up in three weeks." I smiled, remembering when they made mention of it.



Jace clapped behind me.



A thought struck me. I turned quickly to Jace, my fingers trying to unhook my earrings. "Do you know her?"



He shook his head. "Nah. Never mether. But I do know there's someone with two kids for Jaris."



"Hm. I think she knows you, though." I told him what happened at the bar the other day. He seemed surprised.



"That's interesting." His brows were furrowed.actually never met her before. Unless I have but didn't know she was the one."



He seemed to think for some seconds. "Well, it's a good thing I'm here. I'm sure I'll get to meet her in no time."
 MARTA



Marta had extra work to do and had to stay back in the office,through the night.



When she was ready to leave and was shutting her windows, she noticed Lyric leaving.



This surprised her. It was her first day here, and she was barely seen. She shouldn't have too much work that'd require her to stay the night.



Something didn't sit right with her. Her whole act in the surgical ward...


Compelled,she followed her instincts and reached for Mr. Owen's room. She didn't even know why she was there. Lyric had clearly not been able to handle Mr.Owens earlier.Yet, Marta was compelled to check on the man.



Reaching his ward, she found the man asleep.Peacefully,so.


She went closer, inspecting him, and that was when she noticed the stitches on his chest.



"What?" She breathed. She ran her finger along the stitches, feeling how fresh they were.



It looked like a joke. Surgery had been done by the man. But by who? He wasn't scheduled for surgery until the next day.



In a few minutes, she was seated in front of the hospital's footage system. Normally, sha wasn't supposed to have access to those. But Marta had been in TCH for way too long to have her way with the tech men.



One of them stood by while she went through the footage. It didn't come as a shock when she saw Lyric entering the man's ward that evening. She already suspected it. But confirming it caused her a little unease.



She couldn't see what went on in the surgical ward,but Lyric stayed long enough for the surgery to be done. And when she was done and came out,she looked satisfied.



Unease prickled at her neck. How on earth did Lyric perform such complicated surgery on her own? And why did she do it in secret? It didn't make any sense.
###Chapter 63
JARIS



I had an early day at the office.


But before leaving, I decided to check on the kids.I'd returned very late last night and couldn't see them.


Reaching their door, I heard her voice. I slowed my steps,her voice bringing me the usual discomfort.



Seeing and hearing her was the constant reminder of what she does to my body. It was something I hated and wished I could get rid of.


I opened the doors and as soon as my presence was seen,she stopped talking.


She had been sitting on the edge of the bed, applying something on Xylon's chest and massaging. She's always been quite good with the kids. Which was why it puzzled me that she had plans of leaving.


'I know you might not believe it, but Xylon is the reason you caught me in the first place. And I intend to stay and finish my job on him. I chuckled. I can't abandon a soul like that. Never.'


Her words from two days stuck with me. Could there be any truth to that?



"Daddy!" Xyla ran to me, hugging me.



Xylon looked like he'd have the done same had Lyric not been holding him on the bed. But he smiled and waved at me.



"How was youur night?" I tousled Xyla's hair and went close to do the same to Xylon's. This brought me uncomfortably close to Lyric.



I noticed her lick her lips before she said, "Good morning,Alpha."


I simply gave her a curt nod before returning my gaze to Xyla who started talking. "You came home late,dad.Xylon and I waited to see you, but you didn't show up until we fell asleep in your room."



Fell asleep in my room. For some reason, I found that cute.



"Sorry, pumpkin. I had to take care of certain things.Are you done with your list?" I asked them to make an unlimited list of what they wanted for their birthdays.


"Not yet. Aunty Lyric is helping us with it."


I glanced at Lyric, our eyes locking for the briefest moments before she quickly looked away, like there was fire in mine. I've noticed the kids were freer with Lyric than they were with their mother. It was surprising.


She stood up, grabbing her things along. She gave a rare soft smile to Xylon as she helped himn sit up.



"Remember to take the meds when you get home from school, ok<ay?"



He nodded happily.


"Bye, Xyla." She tousled Xyla's hair.


How did she do that? Be so sweet to the kids, I mean.She often gave them smiles she didn't give to just anyone. And in return, the kids were sweet with her.



Her smile dropped when she faced me. Dipping her head,she headed for the door.


I was aware she'd almost passed out in the surgical ward yesterday. The sane me would've asked if she was alright.


But I didn't care. It'd be insane to care.


So,I let her leave.



****十＊＊＊＊＋



GUINEVERE


Arriving TCH that morning, Guinevere was headed to the President's office when Nina, Owen's granddaughter, ran to her with tear-filled eyes.



At first, Guinevere was scared, thinking something had happened to the man. But then she noticed the pregnant girl smiling.



"Oh, thank you. Thank you so much, Guinevere.You don't know what this means to us," Nina said as she pulled her into a hug.



The woman was taken by surprise. Her hands on both sides of the girl's shoulders, she pulled her away.


"What're you talking about, Kinky? I don't think l follow."She always called the girl her pet name from when she was a kid.



"I'm talking about grandpa! He's fine! The surgery was performed on him last night."



Guinevere felt like she'd just been told that the sun was pink.


That shouldn't be possible. Mr. Owens wasn't scheduled for surgery until that morning.


She followed Nina to his room and was shocked to see that it was true. The man was indeed better and laughing like he didn't have a care in the world.He was even happy to see Guinevere. She asked him some questions concerning his surgery, but he told her he had been asleep and didn't know anything of the doctor that had saved him.



When Guinevere left his room, she went straight for the tech room. It was delightful that Owens was okay now, but it was shocking that a doctor would operate on the man without informing anyone.


She gained access to the cameras from the tech guys and watched the footage with surprise. She saw someone go into Owen's ward at night. Someone she knew quite right but didn't expect would do something like that.







MARTA



Marta and Lyric arrived TCH the same time. Although,they kept a good distance between them and didn't communicate.



They were on the ground floor, walking toward the elevator when Guinevere approached them.


She stopped in front of Marta. "Doctor Monroe. I need you in my office.Now."


Her tone was strict this morning. Marta followed her to the office and took a seat when she told her to.



"Care to explain what you did?" Guinevere clasped her hands on the table.



Marta rose her brows. "Sorry?"


"I'm talking about Mr. Owen. You performed the surgery on him!" She scoffed. "It was meant to be performed this morning by a team of doctors. How did you do it on your own?"



Marta lowered her eyes to her legs.


"Marta, that's incredible. I'm glad you're able to pull this off. I'm just surprised you didn't tell anyone about it."



"I-I know. I guess I didn't want to bother the rest of you."


Guinevere went on, telling her about how pleased she was.



"Thank you, ma'am. But could we keep this between us for now? I wouldn't want the others to know I can perform this surgery on my own." She requested.



Guinevere furrowed her brows in surprise. "Why?"


"Well, you know how it is. I'm still trying to get better with the lone surgeries."


She wanted to understand Lyric first. Wanted to know how she's able to do the things she does all by herself.


"Right. I understand." Guinevere nodded. "But good job,Marta. Please keep it up."

###Chapter 64
 LYRIC


Work was extremely boring today. All I did was check patients' vitals. Guinevere thought I still wasn't strong enough and didn't give me any complex work to handle.



I was exhausted at the end of my shift. All I wanted was a good shower and a long sleep. But when l reached home, Kael approached me just before I'd open my door.


"Alpha Jaris wants you to accompany him to a meeting. It's in an hour." He told me after welcoming me.



What!?



"I-I don't think that'll be possible. I just go back and I'm -"



"I tried to tell him you'd be exhausted, but he insisted."



No. No way.


I stormed off, heading to his office. But he wasn't there. I went to his room instead, my mind storming like a cyclone. He ushered me in when I knocked on his door. I didn't like the idea of being alone with him in his bedroom,but I didn't have a choice.


He was rocking something on his table when i walked in.



"Good evening, Alpha." I was doing all I could to sound normal to keep the anger at bay just yet.


He merely glanced at me before looking away. "I believe Kael has passed the information across?"


"Yes! And I came to tell you that won't be possible.I just got back from the hospital, and I'm beyond exhausted!" You could be exhausted when you keep worrying.



Jaris sighed, his expression like one being pestered."I thought we had an understanding, Lyric. You're to accompany me to meetings and events. Or was l supposed to include 'without complaints' in the contract?"



There was something about the way he spoke that always unnerved me. He had the uncanny ability to drop bombshells of annoyance, all while maintaining a serenity that would make Buddha proud.


My anger heightened. "Well, the least you can do is inform me on time. I'm not a robot, Alpha. I have feelings and I get tired."


He continued with whatever it was he was doing on the table.



His silence was frustrating.


"Why don't you just take someone else?" I moved my hands up and down in exhaustion. Afterall, you took Marta to the Rhys' party.



He didn't say anything, only grating on my nerves.I soon realized what his silence meant.



Tears stung at the corner of my eyes. "This isn't fair.It's really not."



I stormed out of the room.







In less than an hour, I was fully dressedand went downstairs to meet Jaris.


Turned out he wasn't down yet. So, I had to wait for him. How funny that I was always doing the waiting.


I huffed as I took a seat. I was irked at the absurdity of attending such a ludicrous meeting. If only I had a choice.



Finally, 'the arrogant king' joined me.I rolled my eyes as I stood up and headed for the door. But | didn't miss the way his eyes lingered on my dress


Well, I was sure looking good in my ankle-length purple dress. My hair was flowing on my shoulders,and I had my red lipstick on.



We both got in the car. Kael drove while Nerion took the front passenger seat. And in no time, we hit the road.







I kept glaring out the window, feeling so mad that was sitting next to him right now and couldn't do anything. He was busy with his system and didn't seem to care about me.


We stopped at a traffic light, awaiting the pedestrians to cross over. Someone caught my attention;someone that made my heart stop in my chest.


My eyes widened in shock as the name escaped my lips."Penelope?"


She was right there, crossing over with the pedestrians.It looked like a dream to me.



For close to five years, I've been looking for her.I've been longing to know where my kids were buried. And now,she was right there! "Penelope!" I called again, louder this time, my hands on the windows.



Of course, she couldn't hear me. The car was soundproofed and tinted black.


Jaris and the others must be looking at me right now like I'd lost my mind. But I didn't care. Before I could stop myself, I opened the door and jumped out of the car.
###Chapter 65
LYRIC



"Lyric!" Jaris shouted my name, but I didn't spare him a glance.


Penelope was already across the road. It was her-short brown hair, body like a model even though she was an advanced woman.


Back when I was with her, I always let her know she was very beautiful.


It was a struggle crossing over to the other side of the road. I jostled against the crowd and managed to get over, but Penelope was already getting into a car.



No.



"Penelope!" | screamed.


But I didn't think she heard me. She wouldn't even look at me.



I tried to make my way toward her, but the crowd kept acting as a painful barrier, slowing me down.


My heart crashed over as I watched her car start moving. 
She was getting away. I was going to lose her!


The realization made me want to cry.


I continued struggling with the crowd but was forced to stop when a strong hand wrapped around my elbow,pulling me back.


"Lyric!" Jaris called with sternly. He looked pissed."What the hell are you doing?"


I shook my gead, turning back to Penelope. But I was too late. Her car was gone.



My eyes shone with tears as my loss registered in me.I lost her. After five years, I was so close for the first time.I wanted to know where my kids were.



"I need an explanation, Lyric. Why did you just run off like that? Do you realize how dangerouus it is? And who the hell is Penelope?" Jaris' harsh grip on me reminded me that he was pissed.


My lips parted but no words formed. All I could think about was the fact that I lost Penelope.


He took-or rather dragged-me back to the car. With every will in me, I fought back my tears. We still had the meeting to attend to. I couldn't ruin my face.


Kael and Nerion had also been out of the car but came back in with Jaris and me. Jaris turned on his seat to face me.



"Now, give me a damn explanation!" He rasped.



I closed my eyes, inhaling deeply and refusing to urge to sink my claws into my hair. It'd ruin my look.


"I'm sorry." I finally found something to say.


"You're going to have to do better than that. Who's Penelope? Who were you after?"



I looked him in the eye and a helpless tear finally came through. But it was just one.


Oh, Jaris. How do I tell him I was only fighting for our dead kids? To know where they'd been laid to rest so I could pay them visits.



Finding Penelope was beyond just finding my babies ' grave. I wanted to make up for all the pain I went through when I lost them.



I had nearly lost my mind and was so desperate to have them in my arms again. It was worse than a drug.


It hurt to do this alone. To know I was all alone.


"Please," I drew in a deep breath as I looked away."Can we just... Can we just go?" Jaris gave me a long stare. But after that, Kael started the car and we were back on the road.



I took my eyes to the window as I wiped the lone tear from my face.


****十＊＊＊＊＋


JARIS



No matter how hard I tried, it seemed I could never understand Lyric Harper.



I was confused by how panicked her jumping out of the car made me. Seeing her running there with her gown and heels while the cars got ready to hit the road made my stupid heart race.


Nobody should have this effect on me. And yet, I ran after her without a second thought.



I didn't see who she was after. Heck, there were too many people on the road. But this Penelope must be important enough for her to risk her life.



I fisted my hands, trying to remain calm as we drove to the meeting hall.


Only the Sovereign Alphas were present for the meeting. If I could have my way, I wouldn't come to these meetings at all. But what could an aspiring Alpha King do?



Lyric sat beside me, same way the Lunas of the other Alphas sat beside their men.


There were some shitty Alphas I wished I didn't have to see. People like Zarek and his mate, Chloe.


And of course,Lyric's shitty ex-Roderick.


He was with another woman-Nora, Lyric's sister.Looks like they both ended up together.


But it didn't look like the bastard had moved on yet as he kept glaring at Lyric and I. Like his glares could cause me any harm.



My eyes drifted toward Lyric from time to time. Her body was the only thing present. I doubted she couuld hear a single thing being said in this place or even acknowledge anyone.



She looked pale and a little shaken, her fingers interlocked under the table. Her eyes, they looked distant. I'd never seen Lyric this way before. Who the fuck was this Penelope woman? What did she mean to her?



After an excruciating couple of hours, the meeting finally came to an end. I had this stupid urge to grab Lyric's arm and pull her to her feet. But like I said, it was stupid. So, I didn't do it. She was not a baby. She could very much walk by herself.



I noticed she looked relieved as soon as we reached the car, like she didn't have to pretend anymore.


"Are you ready to talk now? Can you tell me who this woman is?" | demanded, a little calmer.


I didn't want to explode on her. She looked too pale,I doubted she'd be able to take any of it.


Yet, she still wouldn't utter a word. And it was getting on my nerves.



Exhaling a deep breath, I ordered Kael to drive us home.

###Chapter 66
JARIS



My mother came in not long after I got into my bedroom. I was almost tempted to order her to leave.This woman hardly came with good news



She asked customary questions like how my day went before dropping the unnerving reason she was there.



"Your sister ran away."



I was taking off my jacket and paused when her words reached me.



"But they managed to find her," she adds,calming me the hell down.



For Moon sake, she couldn't have said that sooner?


"Good," I mumbled, undoing my buttons next.


"But she wants to come home, and the asylum's thinking of releasing her.



Like this couldn't get any worse.


"Mother, please." I whirled around to face her. "I honestly can't deal with Maddy right now."Remove a 'd' and the 'y' form her name and you'll have mad. And it wasn't even an insult. She really was mad.



"I know, Jaris. But-"



"The last thing I need right now is Maddy on my neck.You know how it is with both of us."



She never shuts up about our brother. I can't deal with her.


"But she's been away for so long. I've missed her, Jaris.I want her home."



"You can visit her anytime you want. There's no restriction."



"I know. But it's not like having her here at home."


I closed my eyes as I held onto the table for support.I couldn't do this. I was so close to losing my mind.


"Maddy isn't coming home. With the Alpha King trials coming up, the last time I need is her kind of distraction. You know what she does to me when she's around."



"Oh, Jaris..." She grumbled.


Really, what is so hard to understand?

 
"She's not coming home, Mother at least, not now.I have things to do. Please."


I proceeded to take off my jewelry.


Mother spent a little more time in the room, silent.Then she huffed and left.







I took a shower and had a few more things to cover before retiring to bed. I was in the middle of work when Kael showed up, bringing more work to my table.


"She's at the bar. Drunk."



I didn't even need to ask to know who he was referring to. And it was exhausting that I was already so accustomed to the one person that was a pain in the ass.



"For how long now?" I stared down at the table as I asked.



"Since we got back. She left her room almost immediately and had been there ever since."


I growled low in the throat. Seriously, what was it with her always getting drunk?



I stood up with a grunt and in a couple of minutes,l was at the entrance of the bar. 
The place was a little filled up. It was night, and this was when most people had the time to make merry.



But Lyric was alone, asleep on the counter.


The light chatters of the people died down the moment they saw me. They stood up immediately,some going on their knees.


I strode up to Lyric, getting a clearer view of her face.She was sleeping with her lips slightly open and drooling. She looked like a fucking child.


I huffed. This girl has been a pest from the moment l saw her.



Kael stepped beside me. "Do you want me to carry her? Or should I simply wake her up?"


Huh? Wake a drink Lyric to walk on her own in front of all these people? It'd be beyond embarrassing.


"I'll do it." I ground my teeth.


As I gently lifted her head from the table and pulled her backward to my arms, I told myself I was only doing this to create a good impression. I wasn't the type that gave shit about people's opinions, but these were my people. A lot of them already thought I was wrong for arriving late to the mating ceremony-so late that all the guests had left, thinking the ceremony was over.



Maybe carrying Lyric in my arms wvould placate their thoughts. Or that's just what I wanted to believe.


I glanced at her face as I carried her in bridal style.Her hair was all over her face, further making her look wasted.She mumbled something but didn't even open her eyes.


She looked so innocent. Like she did most of the time.



Walking out of the bar with her, my mind drifted to the first day I'd seen her. She had been standing right next to her father, having those doe unsullied eyes like she couldn't hurt a fly and was afraid of getting hurt in return. I could still remember how shocked and nervous she looked when I walked into the room, and the quick disappointment that crossed her face when I walked out on them without uttering a word. She must've been really hurt.



But it was just like they said: the innocent ones could be the most dangerous.


I reached her room and laid her in bed. I couldn't begin to imagine the hangover she'd get in the morning from being this way.


I brushed some messy hair stands from her face,my fingers grazing her skin. She seemed to relax and mumble something under her breath. She was still unconscious. I wonder what must be going through her head.



Her hand gripped the collar of my shirt when I didn't expect. Her head tilted slightly, and this time, when she murmured, I could make out the words. "Please,stay."


My brows scrunched up in surprise. Could this have something to do with Penelope? Who was that woman,and what hold does she have over Lyric?


"You always leave," she slurred the words. "You always leave, Jaris." She tugged at the fabric, bringing me closer to her face. My chest was just barely an inch from her face. What in the moon's name was she doing?



More to my surprise, she buried her nose in my shirt,moaning softly.


Lyric Harper. She was talking about me. She called my name.


This did nothing to ease my confusion. What did she mean by that statement?



I pulled back so her face was free of my chest as l didn't want her to suffocate herself or something However, she only moaned from the loss. She squirmed on the bed, tilting her head up. She murmured more incoherent words under her breath.It was tiring.


I tried to pull away but her hand found my shirt again,pulling me back to her.


"Damn it," I cursed.



And I knew she wasn't the problem. She was drunk and defenseless. I could easily escape her grip if I wanted.Yet,here I was, allowing myself to be dragged by her.


'This isn't you, Jaris', my subconscious told me, trying to warn me that I was doing something stupid.


I should push myself away from her. Leave this room and go away.


Instead, I wanted to touch her face.Wanted to bury my fingers in my hair and inhale that fucking apple shampoo fragrance. I wanted to claim her lips and feel her body against mine.


This body.



This very one that had been grating on my nerves.


For the first time in as long as I could remember, my heartbeat accelerated. This was not right. Nothing ever fazed me. Yet, the prospect of being alone in a semi dark room with Lyric Harper was enough to take me out of ease.


Time moved sluggishly. Her lips were parted,begging for an invite.


'She's drunk, Jaris,' the evil subconscious said. 'She won't remember any of these by morning.


It was right. And even if it wasn't, even if there was a chance that she could wake up and remember whatI did to her, I didn't care anymore.


'It's just a taste.'



I crashed my lips on hers.
###Chapter 67

JARIS



She gaspoed, a light exhale escaping her.


The strong smell and taste of alcohol coated my tongue-Château Margaux,specifically. But other than that,she tasted mighty fine.


'It's just a taste.'



My hand gripped the back of her head, pulling her up to meet my kiss.


For someone who was drunk, she took it quite well.And fuck, it was beyond good.



It felt like a brainquake, shaking up my thoughts in the most exhilarating way


'It's just a taste.'


My hand flexed around her throat. If she wasn't so drunk, I'd have choked her. But that wouldn't be too good now,would it?



I moved the hand downward until I reached the hem of her dress. 'It's just a taste.'


Yet, I couldn't stop my fingers when they moved beneath her dress, caressing bare skin.


I pulled away from her lips to mutter a 'fuck.' Because that was exactly how I felt right now.


All I wanted was a fucking taste of her lips, yetl couldn't get enough. Because Lyric's lips were fucking addictive.



She tasted like the first sip of warm cocoa on a winter's night, rich and comforting. It was a mental marvel.



She moaned deeply, throwing her arms around my neck.



"Jaris..." Her voice was like a soft caress of sugar spun cotton, wrapping around me in warmth. Damn it. This woman was going to sound good in bed.



To my surporise, she rocked her hips to meet mine. She was desperate for this. Desperate for me.


I let my fingers wander further beneath her dress.I reached her thigh-the thick soft flesh-and there was nothing I didn't do to resist giving it a tight squeeze.


In the end,I failed. 
She released a breathy moan, her hand tightening around my shoulders. Had she been as horny for me like | was this whole time? This was a fucking discovery.


I know I should stop this. Not because it was wrong-hell, I'd never entirely care for right and went in my life-but because I shouldn't want her this way. Not after what she'd done to me.



Yet, I let my fingers keep wondering, all the way to her underwear, until it was beneath it, too.


She exhaled slowly, throwing her head back.She may be drunk, but she was clearly enjoying this. And something about that fact just fueled my needs.


Scorching shivers raced across my flesh, sending heat radiating from head to toe when my fingers found her core. I froze for a moment, letting it sink in.


I was touching Lyric Harper. Intimately.



Lyric might not be the only one that'd wake up to a change tomorrow. By morning, I'll ask myself what the fuck I just did.



But for now,however,I was lost.



I let out a low growl as I rubbed against her clit while nuzzling my lips against her cheek. She was soaking

 wet!



I was painfully hard. All I wanted was to pull out of my pants and claim Lyric right now, on this bed.


Before I could think better of it, I thrust a finger into her. She gasped, a small startled thing


I bet this wouldn't be her reaction if she was fully conscious right now.



She whimpered, her chest rising and falling in a slow pace.



Fuck,how was she so tight? She squeezed around my finger, her wetness coating me.



Sweat beaded my forehead as I imagined my dick replacing my finger. Imagine moving in a cunt this tight and wet. It'd be pure bliss.


I added another finger and fucked her, drawing small cries of pleasure from her. My eyes devoured her,all my nerves tingled to life, each one pulsating with vibrant energy.



I took her lower lip between my teeth and bite. She whimpered and I sucked right on it.


I did the same to her upper lip, then moved my lips to her throat where I kissed the hollows of her neck. 'Stop this, Jaris!'


No! It was too addictive!



I was pissed at the knowledge that I could do this all day. Nobody should have this effect on me. Nobody at all.



It was a weakness.



Her fingers dug into my back as her moans turned deeper. But they could hardly cause any harm considering the fact that I was wearing a shirt, and her moves were weak.



But I knew she wasn't doing it to get me off her. Like me,the pleasure was too much for her to handle.


"Oh, please..." she whimpered. "Don't... stop."


I recognized the sound of that. She was close to the top.


It was all the encouragement I needed.


I fastened my pace, rolling my thumb against her clit.In seconds, she exploded on my fingers, her cries loud enough to startle the shadows and make the night blush.



My own breathing got harsher, and before I could hit the brakes on my impulses, I sank my teeth into her neck, giving her a small bite.


Shit, no! The realization struck me like lightning.


I shouldn't have done that. It'd leave a mark.


She whimpered beneath me, coming down from her high.


When I wrenched my fingers free, she took a deep breath.



She was satiated. But I wasn't. No, I was far from it.



I wanted my cock to replace where my fingers had been. I wanted to feel her tight around me. I wanted to take her until she'd have to beg me to stop.


But that would be going too far. Not because it was wrong. But because I didn't want to.


So,despite how hard it was, I peeled myself off her,climbing off the bed.


"Jaris..." she breathed. She was more relaxed now,her body well spent. She'd probably have to skip work tomorrow 'cause I wasn't sure she was waking up anytime soon.


I brushed my fingers into my hair. The weight of everything crashed on me at once. It wasn't just what I did but what I still wanted to do,and if I stayed here any longer, I feared I'd really do it.


I stomped out of the room. Kael was right there, and even if he didn't say the words, he gave me those judgy eyes.


I ignored him and went to my room, slammed the door shut and hurried to the bathroom.



I shouldn't have done this. Not to Lyric. Not to the woman who had hurt and betrayed me when no one else would dare.



My erection came into my hand. The image of her beneath me and at the mercy of my pleasure to filled my head.


This time, the vision was more potent. More detailed.All it took was four jerks and I came in my hand.


I hissed, my hand holding onto the wall above me for support.



This was nothing like I'd felt before. The orgasm was explosive.
###Chapter 68

LYRIC



"Lyric. Lyric! Wake up, sleepyhead!" There was a rough tap against my shoulder.


My eyes fluttered open but quickly went shut from the light that nearly blinded me.


"Open your damn eyes, will you?"


I could recognize Jace's' voice from anywhere.



I opened my eyes again and tried to adjust to the brightness in the room.


"The windows," I mumbled. "Close them."


"No. They're staying open until you get your ass out of bed. Why are you still asleep? What are you,a toddler?"



My hand went over my forehead, feeling how hot it was. Was I running a temperature right now?



"My head..." I moaned.


It hurt. If I didn't know better, I'd think a party was taking place in it. "Of course, that is what happens when you stay up drinking into the night."


I managed to look at Jace. He was standing at the foot of the bed, scowling at me like he was a parent.


I sat up, dragging the duvet to my chest.


What happened...?


"What time is it?" I swallowed past the lump in my throat.



"One p.m, ma'am."



What!?



My eyes widened like saucers.



No!



That would explain why the sun was so bright.


"Jace! I'm supposed to be at TCH!"


"Well, I'm not the alcohol you drank. And if I hadn't come in now, you'd still be sleeping youur ass off."


I scrambled out of bed, only to find my legs slightly shaky. Then, it hit me-the discomfort between my legs. "What..." I couldn't form any words as I lowered myself on the edge of the bed.



Jace's brows scrunched up in concern. "What is it?"


"I don't... I don't know."


Suddenly, it came crashing on me-fragments of my dream.



It was unclear, but I was very sure it was Jaris. He was here with me, in my bed,touching me.


I shivered at the thought.



No. It wasn't possible. It was the second time I was having such weird dreams of Jaris. And that was what it was.Weird.



But today was different. Today, I could feel the discomfort in my legs.


I put my hand over my belly. It was almost as if I could still feel his touch.



"Lyric?" Jace held my shoulder.


I took a deep breath. "I'm fine. I just... I just need to make a call."



I didn't even know what I was going to say to my superior. I fidgeted with the neck of my dress as I stood by the window and made the call. I couldn't believe l actually slept in this dress.


I sucked in a breath when Guinevere picked the call.


"Uh... Hi, ma'am. I am- I'm so sorry. I know | was supposed to be there this morning. I was actually unwell and had to...."



I tumbled out an explanation. Goodness, I felt incompetent. I'd been so clumsy at work of late.



"It's fine, Lyric. You can actually take the day off,"Guinevere replied, surprising me.



Huh!?


"Oh," I tucked some strands of hair behind my ear.


Guinevere didn't look like someone who would tell you to take the day off when you call to apologize for coming late. How was I being lucky?


I thanked her and brushed my fingers through my hair when the call ended.



"Are you alright?" Jace asked from behind,clearly noticing my discomfort.


No, I wasn't. I was so restless. Deliciously so.Something didn't feel right with me. Still,I lie as I walked into the bathroom. "I'm fine."



It was even worse being in the bathtub. Each time l closed my eyes, I could feel his lips against mine, his hands touching me. Caressing me intimately.


It was even worse than the dream I had in that garden.This one felt real. Too real.


A grunt left my throat when I touched my clit. It didn't feel normal.



But I knew it wasn't possible. Nobody would dare touch me in here.


Although...how did I even end up in my bedroom last night? Who helped me?


Jace was no longer in the room when I returned.I looked for something simple to wear and was brushing my hair in the mirror when my eyes fell on the mark on my neck.



I gasped, my brush falling from my hand to the table.



No way!


I moved my hair aside to have an unrestricted view.There was a red mark on my neck, like teeth had sunk into it.



Dread pooled in my stomach. I might not be mistaken. Someone might've truly been here.


With shaky fingers, I tied my hair and stormed out of the room.



I was in the bar in no time, standing in front of the bartender who had become friendly with me. He'd been showing he a lot of respect since I became Luna,and coupled with the fact that he was a nice guy, it wasn't difficult becoming semi-friends with him.


"I know I passed out in myseat. Who took me?" My voice was raw with impatience.


The bartender looked hesitant before releasing the name. "Kael. I'm sure the Alpha must have ordered him to do so."



My throat tightened.



Kael took me to my room. And right after, I was touched.



No. Kael wouldn't do this to me. He didn't strike me like the kind of man...right?


I looked for him and met him in the gym. Of course,he was a gym lover. It was how he had so many muscles and a finely-tuned body.


He dipped his head when I stood beside him. But I wasn't there for pleasantries. "I was told it was you who helped me from the bar.What happened when you took me to my room?"



I didn't want to spell the question out to him.I understood how overwhelming it could be when someone gets accused of something they're not guilty of.


He furrowed his brows, seeming surprised. "Nothing.I laid you in bed and left. And nobody went into your room,either."



He sounded honest. Kael was an honest man. I didn't even know why I suspected him.


It just didn't feel right. Or was this mark on my neck merely a coincidence? Were the memories of someone touching me only a coincidence? Was it normal to have such vivid sex dreams?







The following morning, as I bathed for work,something strange happened.



For the first time, I did something I never thought I'd do.



My head was thrown back against the tub, my eyes closed as my fingers traveled to my core. My weird dream from the other night filled my head,sending shivers down my spine.


I was touched. In a good way.


And not just by anyone but Jaris.


Of course, it was him. His smell was unmistakable.



I could still hear his voice in my head from the one time he moaned.



His smell was intoxicating and delicious. His broad body on mine felt so good.


And when he touched me,right where I was touching myself,it was the best feeling.



I fastened my pace, rubbing my clit to the memory of my dream. My mouth fell open as I struggled to breathe. I came at the same time I did in my dream,and a scream filled the bathroom.



Holy smokes!



I was exhausted when I climbed down from my high.I couldn't even lift a finger.


This didn't make any sense. How could I come to the mere memory of this dream. Of something that wasn't real. But as I brushed my hair in front of the mirror, my fingers grazed the fading mark on my neck. The one thing that felt real.


My eyes were sad in the mirror as I reminded myself it wasn't possible. Jaris hated me and would never touch me this way. I was clearly the one with issues who wouldn't stop dreaming of him.



What was wrong with me?
###Chapter 69
LYRIC



My day at TCH was going fine.


I had surgery in two hours, but before then, I was excited to see Xylon who had come for his monthly check up.


I had my client's file in my hand and examined it as l headed to Xylon's room. It was the patient I'd be performing surgery on in a couple of hours. There was a lot I had to catch up on in his file.


"Hi, aunty!" Xyla's sweet voice reached my ears from the bed when I walked into the room.


She ran into me before I even got the chance to look at her.


"Hi, baby," I laughed, patting her on the back.


I lifted my eyes to look for Xylon and my smile dropped, sinking low into my stomach in a way that hurt.



My hands dropped to my sides, my eyes quickly darting to the floor. No one had mentioned he was here. I didn't brace myself for it."G...Good morning." I'd never dipped my head so clumsily before.



Lyric,please.


Unlike me who was suddenly flustered, Jaris was effortlessly calm as he sat on the edge of the bed,next to Xylon whose vitals were being checked by a nurse.



"Lyric." He gave a curt nod.


I tried to look at him but failed. I'd never been so nervous around Jaris. What was wrong with me?



My dream chose the wrong time to crash on me.Suddenly, seeing him in the room made it feel more real.



Touching me.Kissing me.Making me feel good.


I closed my eyes, shaking my head.


"Are you alright, aunty?" Sweet Xyla asked, snapping me back to reality.



Goodness.



"Of course, darling. I was just calculating something,"I stroked her hair.


Jaris' eyes were on me. I wasn't staring at him, but I could feel his eyes on me.


Coughing to clear the lump in my throat, I moved forward,going to meet Xylon. Unfortunately,however,it brought me closer to Jaris.



I did my best to ignore the fact that we were in close proximity.


"How're you doing, boy?" I tickled his ear, making him giggle.


Gods, his giggles were the cutest thing! How could one child be so adorable?



I chat a little with the kids until Xylon's checkup was done. I asked the nurse how he was and got a positive feedback from her.



Whatever I was doing with him at home was working.I had to keep it up.



I had my hand wrapped around XyLa's shoulder as we walked out of the room, Xylon and his father behind us.



"Okay. I have to get back to work. See you soon?"|dropped to a crouch before the kids.



"We could play Charades!" Xyla said excitedly.


Charades was a new game we had grown to love. "Sure! Get ready to cry 'cause I'll be winning today," I teased her.



"Xyla and I...won you the last time." Xylon answered,melting my heart.


He rarely spoke that when he did, it was a pleasure getting to hear him.


A nurse showed up behind me. "Excuse, ma'am.Your attention is needed."



I bleed to her before turning back to the kids. "So,make sure you're good.See you soon."


As I turned to leave, I made the mistake of glancing at Jaris.


Oh, I shouldn't have done that, because my body did that stupid thing where it reacted to my dream.


I also caught a glimpse of amusement in his face.He must be surprised that I was so good with the kids.


Well,even me was surprised. And it hurt me to know I'd have been a good mother had my own kids been alive.







It was thirty minutes to the surgery. I was walking alongside an assisting doctor, headed to the surgical ward while we both went through the process.


My steps came to a sudden pause when I found an unpleasant sight before me. It wasn't supposed to be unpleasant, yet I felt this twinge in my guts.


Before me, Marta, Jaris and the kids walked,heading toward the exit. Marta was talking to Jaris. I couldn't make out what was being said, but Jaris listened to her attentively.


They stopped at the revolving doors, and to my horror, Marta lifted her hands to his collars, arranging it.


She did that in public! In front of so many people.


Jaris was backing me, so I couldn't seehis reaction.But it must be something she was used to, otherwise,she wouldn't do it in public.


The agony took a jab at my heart.



Suddenly, so many eyes were on me, including the doctor standing beside me.



The situation was awkward. I, his mate,was standing aside while another woman fixed his collar for everyone to see.



Well,she wasn't just any woman. She was the mother of his kids! What was wrong with me? Like everyone else, Marta's eyes locked on mine.I expected the victorious smile that spread on her face.


Jaris lowered her hands from his shirt, then walked out the door with the kids. He didn't even turn for one second to look around. He probably had no idea I'd seen that.



The damage had already been done,coming with the painful realization that Marta was more important to Jaris than I was. Even on the night we got mated, he spent it with her.



Yet, it was I who wouldn't stop having these stupid dreams.



"Doctor Lyric? We should get going." The young doctor beside me brought me back to reality.


I blinked rapidly, shaking the thoughts off.
###Chapter 70
LYRIC



My patient was sick with Chrono-Flux Displacement and had been in this condition for eleven years.



Despite our strong immune system as wolves, there were still some unbeatable sicknesses and poisons.It was sad that some people even ended up losing their lives.



The team was ready when I walked into the ward.Guinevere and two other doctors stood outside the window,watching.



This was my second chance. I couldn't mess it up like I did the first time. The doctors woud definitely lose faith in me.



I stayed up late, rehearsing every process. I was wearing my abyssal gloves today as I didn't want to make contact. I won't be siphoning the man's sickness,but at least, the surgery would be successful.


I started the process, praying deeply not to panic like the last time.



Please,Lyric. You have to get this right. After an hour, the surgery ended.


It wasn't until I dropped my suture that I realized it was successful. I didn't flinch!


I laughed happily as I looked at the window. Outside,Marta had joined the doctors watching me.



Guinevere looked pleased.


Yes! I did it!



The patient would definitely take longer to heal compared to if I'd touched him, but he'd be fine.Even without me siphoning his sickness.


"Congratulations, Lyric. That was awesome,"Guinevere said when I walked out of the ward.



I dipped my head and headed for the restroom where I got rid of my gloves and washed my hands.


I felt better. Not entirely happy, but better.



I was headed for my office and was about to round a corner when I heard voices. More importantly,I heard my name.


"I'm telling you, he doesn't fee a thing for her. Marta is the one with kids for him. She's more important than Lyric," a female voice said.


"You're right. But why didn't he just make Marta his Luna,then? Sure, Lyric is prettier, but Marta is also very beautiful. She's intelligent. Hardworking. I'm sure she'd have made a better Luna."



A knot of nausea coiled tightly within me, twisting in protest against the unsettling things I heard.


"Do you think Lyric forced herself on him?" A new voice asked. "I mean, Jaris is the most powerful Alpha.Even I would throw myself at him at the slightest chance. Do you think it's possible Lyric's family was so power hungry,they forced her on him?"


"It makes sense. It'd explain why he was so late even to his own mating ceremony."


"Gosh. She's so shameless. How does she feel now that she's with a man who might never love her?"


My mind spun, overwhelmed by the relentless barrage of assumptions crashing around me. I couldn't believe this was what I'd been reduced to-someone who forced herself on Jaris?



The words cut through me, hurting as much as it did when I'd been called ugly all those years.


I stepped into the corner, letting them see me. The conversation stopped abruptly. There was an initial The three of them were fellow doctors like me.I couldn't believe they could hang around and gossip about someone who had been nice to them.



Of course, I'd been nice. I always greeted them with warm smiles when we bumped into each other. I've always admired them from afar. How could they be so cruel?



"Aren't there better things to do instead of hanging around and saying things that are of no concern to you?"



"Excuse me?" One of them scoffed. Kayla. She was the one I'd admired most among the trio. "We were only having a conversation. Don't you think it was wrong to have eavesdropped, Mrs. Dreadmoor?"



I didn't miss the way she called the second name with mockery. I put my hands into the pockets of my lab coat so I could fist them without them seeing. I didn't want them to see the effect they had on me.



The other two-Margot and Celine-simply gawked at me without any ounce of remorse.



"You think I'm the one at fault?" I huffed. "This is a professional space, doctor Kayla. You of all people should know more about work ethics." "Please," she rolled her eyes. "We were merely passing time. Besides, it isn't like a single lie was told,was it?"



"Kayla, I think we should just go." Celine tried to hold her hand,but the arrogant nurse didn't let her.



"What?" She scoffed. "I can't have someone point fingers at me like I did something wrong. We all talk about people, and not a single loir was said about her.


"We're right; her mate did come late to the ceremony.Have you seen the chemistry between him,Marta and the kids? They're like the perfect family. And this right here, if you ask me," her eyes burned with defiance as she looked down at me. "is like one of those women you'd call a home wrecker."



I was seething with rage. But this was a professional ground. There wasn't much I could do.



"I think you've said enough." I stepped toward her,trying to hide the pain in my voice. "Kayla Sky, there's no telling what I'd do if you say one more word about me."



"But you know it's the truth," Margot rolled her eyes."It's obvious you got mated to Alpha Jaris for power I wonder how you intend to live for the rest of your life,knowing his heart belongs to another." 
With that very painful stab, they walked out on me.


I ran to my office, locking the door and bursting into tears.



It freaking hurt. It hurt so much to hear the truth.



Because I wasn't so sure they were lies.



In what way would Jaris ever pick me over the mother of his kids? In what world would I ever be important to him?







At the end of my shift, I called Juan and asked if she was free for a drink. She was glad and invited me over.



Becky was around, and the three of us drank, made jokes, and just like that, most of my worries were forgotten. I'd really needed the distraction.
###Chapter 71
LYRIC



Two Days Later.


It was the most important day in our world.


The first of the three trials.


I stood before the mirror, staring at my bleak reflection. My hair and makeup looked perfect. Jaris had hired professionals to attend to me and ensure l looked my best.



Of course, it was important I looked my best. I'd be seated next to him as his Luna for everyone to see.He cared much for his reputation.


Despite the anticipation in the air, I couldn't help the feeling of unease that gnawed at my stomach. Just a while ago, while I bathed, I did that stupid uncomfortable thing again. I touched myself until l came, all to the memory of that weird dream.


I'd never been able to make myself cum before. But this...it was beyond anything I could explain. Beyond the memory.


Each time the dream came to mind, it always felt real.It was as if I could feel him on me. Feel his kisses, his stimulating touch, his passion.


It was too real to ignore. To real not to cum.


And it bothered me.



Yesterday, I even opened up to Jace about it. Told him I'd been having this disturbing dream and didn't know what it meant.



He wasn't of much help and simply teased me about being obsessed with Jaris who didn't like me.



I felt stuck. Confused.



Someone knocked, followed by my door opening.Only one person would knock and enter without waiting for my permission. "See who's looking like a doll!" Jace chuckled as he walked up to me.


He was outfitted in a handsome suit, his hair freshly-shaved.



I flashed him a small smile before looking away."Hi,Jace."



"Hm. Someone does not look happy. Tell me,cutie.What's making that pretty face sad?"


I rolled my eyes, then turned around so my back was against the dresser.


"You look good," I mumbled.


"Yeah," he frowned as he looked down at the suit."I actually didn't wwant to come to this, but that dickhead, Kael insisted I do or I risk being kicked out of Darkspire. You know, that man might really go missing one day."


I laughed-genuinely this time. "You two are crazy."


He picked us the glass of wine I'd been drinking and emptied it down his throat. "You know, you'd also become quite powerful when Jaris wins this thing.You'd become the Luna to every other Luna." He chuckled, obviously liking how it tasted on his tongue.


"Then, you'd have more people wanting to kiss your ass. You'd be respected everywhere you go.Hm.My little friend."


Unlike him who seemed pleased, my smile faded.The painful reality jabbed me in the chest, making me feel nothing but pain.


"You seem to be forgetting it's only for a year," the words were acrid on my tongue.


I cleared my throat and looked toward the window.


Dawning on Jace, his countenance dropped as he ran his hand through his face. "Fuck. Lyric, I'm...I'm sorry. I honestly don't know why I forgot."


Marta was going to be my replacement. Jaris only wanted me for a year before Marta took over. But why would he even want me for just a year? It didn't make much sense.


"It's fine." | forced a smile at Jace. "We should get going."







Reaching downstairs, one of the guards was there to lead me to Jaris who had been waiting in his Stretch SUV.



The air seemed to shift as soon as I settled beside him. i took a deep breath, forcing the oxygen to remain in my lungs.


"Greetings, Alpha." My voice lacked its usual warmth.


It was difficult to sound normal when I was hurting because of this very man.


We were both in the backseat, yet felt so far due to the distance between us.


Jaris looked stunning. I could tell from the brief glance I took at him. He also smelt good, of rich cologne. It was the very one I smelt in my dream.And that, on its own, was a torment.


"Hi, Lyric," he murmured without looking at me.


In a minute, we hit the road.






The trial was taking place in a much bigger hall. It was packed to the brim as the pack members of each participating Alpha were present.


Not everyone, though. Otherwise, there wouldn't be enough space for people to breathe.


Jaris and I were led in through the back entrance and onto the main stage where the participating Alphas and their Lunas sat. I did not miss the dissatisfied look that filled the faces of the other Alphas as soon as they saw Jaris.


They must be intimidated by his participation.Well,even I would've felt the same way.


Jaris' expression was as hard as rock as we were ledto take our seats. I found myself being a little nervous.


Jaris and I might have our differences. He might be an ass and hurt my feelings most of the times, but l still wanted him to win.


The hall was a little noisy as guests made their way in and tried to settle in. I used the distraction to stare at Jaris.



Man was undoubtedly handsome. Charming. He was the cutest male I'd ever seen, despite how rude he was.



My mind drifted to five years ago, on that magical night when he called me a name I'd never been called before.


'Your wish is my command, Princess.'


'Until tonight, I don't think I've ever met a lady as stunning as you, Princess.'


My breath froze in my throat. Those were the cutest things anyone had ever said to me. Even after so long, they sounded so clear in my head like they'd only been said yesterday.



'Do you think we could adjust our deal? I'd love to spend another day with you.'


More of his magical words.


I sniffled, dragging my eyes to my nails. I really needed to stop thinking about him if I didn't want to risk ruining my makeup and gaining people's attention.



I felt better when the chairman-Jace's father-came up and addressed the people. It was a welcomed distraction.


The hall became quiet. Some peace, finally.


He welcomed everyone, including the Alphas and their Lunas.



Then, he spoke about the first trial which he said was termed 'A King's Wisdom.



A large screen on the wall came on. There, we could see various rooms sliding past.


The Chairman explained what the rooms meant. The participating Alphas would be in it, each at a time.They were to escape the rooms within a given time.And we, the viewers, would be able to see all the decisions they make and the actions they take.


I've heard a lot about how tricky the trails could be.It was the first time I'd be getting to watch it.I considered it a privilege.


The participating Alphas were summoned. My eyes caught onto Roderick, only because he'd been staring at me. I hadn't even noticed he was present as I had been too busy stealing glances at Jaris.


Of course, Roderick Fletcher wouldn't miss this opportunity for anything in the world. Someone that thrived on power.


Alpha Zarek was there as well. That familiar feeling of unease wrapped around me. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't help the feeling that he was hiding something from me.

 The Chairman addressed the Alphas, giving them the simple rules of the trial. Firstly, they were forbidden from using their powers in any form.


He told them, "this is a trail for the wisest minds.It is to see how right you think."


Finally, he conveyed, "At this moment, you're to see yourselves as the Alpha King. Think as one. Act like one."



He wished them luck, and off they were. They were led away by some guards who took them through a narrow path.


I sucked in a deep breath as I rubbed my palms together. Some of them would fail this trial. I knew it.Not all could pass.


Deep down, I hoped Jaris would be among the winners.



On the stage now were the Lunas of the Alphas. We sat back and waited for the first Alphas to perform.

###Chapter 72

 JARIS



The Alpha trials were never easy. If there was one thing they did, they made it look easy. Easy enough for you to let your guard down and fail.


I waited in a separate hall with the others. Our phones were taken from us so there would be no form of communication, and all around us,there were guards, watching us like hawks.


One at a time, an Alpha was taken out of the hall to go through his own trial. It would take about twenty minutes before they return and take another.


The Alphas that had been taken to participate do not return to the hall. So, our numbers kept depreciating.


Roderick was taken. The asshole had been glaring non-stop at me. I wish he'd fail. It'd be a delight to see the disappointment in his face. We were just three left when they took me. I shot Zarek a glance before leaving. He didn't look pleased at all. Pleased that I was here.


Asshole.



I followed the two men who led me down a corridor,stopping in front of a red door.


One of the men addressed me. "This door connects to ten rooms. You have fifteen minutes to get out of all the rooms. All you have to do is find the key out of each of them. Each room carries a wall clock that displays how much time you have left. Good luck,Alpha Jaris Dreadmoor."


The door opened and a bright light greeted my face.l walked in without hesitation, bearing at the back of my mind that I had a minute and thirty seconds to get out of each room.



The door went closed behind me, and the lights dimmed. Much better.


Standing on a spot, I ran my eyes quickly around the jam-packed room.


First, I took note of the wall clock like he said. My time was at fourteen minutes, fifty-five seconds.


I found the camera. They were watching me. Seeing my every move.


Yet, in that moment, I didn't think of the hundreds of people watching me from the hall.


I thought of her.


Lyric Harper.


She was there with them, watching me as well.


I wonder, was she praying for me to win or lose?We've not been on the best of terms. I wouldn't be surprised if she wanted me to lose.



I set to work, running my eyes and hands through the things in the room.



I looked through the clothes on the floor but couldn't find any key. On the table were multiple empty jars. It was easy to see that there was no key.


I opened the drawer and found a small black purse.Opening it, I found a key.


I reached for the door and unlocked it. Hm. That was quite easy.


The door opened to a new room.


As soon as I walked in, the door to the old room behind me went shut.


The new one was not as messy as the previous one.So,it was easier to see through.


The table was empty, the drawers the same. The bed was neat. There was no key on it.


I checked under the bed and there it was. Stilleasy.


I unlocked the door to another room which was very messy. But in the end, I found the key.


Everything went smoothly until I reached the sixth room. I had eight minutes left.


RN GUIL I checked every corner but couldn't find a damn key.The jars on the table were filled with stupid things that didn't look like a key.


Wanting to be extra sure, I emptied all the jars on the table, yet no key fell out with the things that did.


"Damm it." I looked around the room. Where the hell was it?



Something clicked in my mind.


I turned back to the things I'd emptied on the table and found a yarn. In it was a needle.


I pulled the needle out, went to the door and inserted it into the keyhole.I hissed when the door opened.



There was no fucking key. Only a needle.



I ran out of the room to the next. This one was much easier. But the previous room had already taken two minutes of my time.



I made it to the seventh room which was only cleaner than the others. The bed in the room didn't even have a pillow on it.



The table was clean. So were the drawers. There was no place to look.


Except for the pile of clothes on the floor.


I picked the first cloth and realized all of them had a pocket. I'd have to sort through every pocket to find a key. My time would be exhausted by the time l finished.



I looked at the door and noticed the knob was slightly bent. Going to it, I tried to turn the knob and it clattered to the ground. The door creaked open. It was never locked.


"Smart assholes," I muttered to myself.


I ran into the eighth room. Unlike the other rooms,this one had a ceiling fan.


It was the first thing I checked.


The fan wasn't rotating. Sweeping my hand over the blades, I found the key on one of them. I opened the door to the ninth room which was quite messy. But the one thing that caught my attention was the chest on the table.



I tried to open it and discovered it was locked. So,I searched the room. But this time, I wasn't looking for the door key. I was looking for the pin to the chest.


I had one minute, twenty seconds left.


Shit.



I found the pin under the pillows and unlocked the chest. In it was the key.


I unlocked the door to the final room and came to an abrupt pause.


This room was completely clean-not a single piece of furniture in it. But there was a girl on her knees, her hands bound with a rope.



She was dressed in a shabby dress, like a slave would.



She kept her head low when she saw me. "Welcome, my King. I have the key here with me."


She opened her palms, showing me the key.


My brows furrowed in suspicion.


She addressed me as a King. That was the way the Alpha King was addressed.


The Chairman's words came to mind: 'At this moment, you're to see yourselves as the Alpha King!'


The girl on her knees spoke again. "You must hurry,my king. Your time is running out."


I looked at the clock. Fifty-nine seconds left.


This should be the easiest room so far. The key was right there in her palm. All I had to do was take it,open the door and leave.


Yet, something felt wrong. It was too easy.
###Chapter 73
JARIS



"Why are you tied?" | went closer to the girl.


"I have been this way for as long as I can remember,my king. I have been in captivity for so long I have grown accustomed to it.



She glanced at the wall. "My king, the clock is ticking." Her voice was filled with worry.



But I didn't even glance at it. Not anymore.



More of the Chairman's words came to mind.'this is a trial for the wisest minds. It is to see how right you think.



'you're to see yourselves as the Alpha King. Think as one. Act like one'



I was the Alpha King. The girl before him was one of his people. She had been in captivity for so long.


What kind of a king would I be if I abandoned her?


I dropped to one knee, grabbed her hand and started undoing the ropes.


I could easily tear the ropes apart with my Alpha strength, but one of the rules said not to use our powers in any form.


The girl gasped, her eyes going wide with shock.


"My King! You'll never be able to meet up!"


I glanced at the clock. Just ten seconds left.


The rope was too tight. But I didn't give up. I kept trying.


This was all a test. It was the people's responsibility to be concerned for their klng, which was the reason the girl was worried about the time. But it was my duty as their king to be more concerned about them.


I kept glancing at the clock. The seconds were going down.


I finally fred the ropes, but it came off the same time the alarm went off.


My time was up.



Damn it!



I didn't meet up.


My enthusiasm waned.


"Thank you, my king," the girl muttered.


She remained on her knees, her head bowed, her palms showing me the key.


Reluctantly, I took it from her, opened the door and stepped out.


I was greeted with a sight I did not expect. Not with what I'd done.



There were cheers and applauses, and these tiny ribbons floating in the air. I froze at the door,confused and wondering if they were celebrating my failure.
Luca walked up to me, holding a lanyard that clearly read '1st Trial Done.
For someone like me who was hardly ever confused,this got me.
"Congratulations, Alpha Jaris. You made it," Luca beamed and wore the lanyard over my neck.
"How?" I gave him a questioning look.
The Chairman walked up to me. "We never mentioned that the end aim of the trial is to make it out of the rooms in time. We only told you you had fifteen minutes. Didn't mean if you hadn't made it before fifteen minutes, you'd have lost. It was a trail for the wisest minds. We wanted to see how you'd act as a King when you happen upon your people in trouble, even if you are in a hurry to get somewhere."He dipped his head. "Congratulations, Alpha Jaris.You made it to the second round."

Cold relief washed over me, as well as astonishment.
These men were something else. Tricky as fuck.


I glanced down at the lanyard with renewed pride.So,I made it.


Bobbing my head, I made my way to my seat,next to a smiling Lyric. It dawned on me that she was happy.


"Congratulations, Alpha," she muttered in the faintest of voices, as though she was shy saying it.


Funnily creepy.


I simply inclined my head at her.


I looked at Roderick's seat. He wasn't there, neither was his partner.


＊＊＊＊十＊＊＊＊十



LYRIC



Perhaps, I should've found a way not to come to this trial at all. Because my stupid heart wouldn't stop beating since | watched Jaris on the screen.


I'd been so nervous for him as I watched him through the cameras. He was the third Alpha to have won so far,five failing before him.


The trial was quite challenging. Some of the Alphas didn't even make it to the tenth room to see the final task. Some that did-like Roderick -was too time-conscious to care about the girl on her knees. They just grabbed the key and opened the door.


Roderick had almost caused a fight when he was told he didn't pass the trial. He yelled about being tricked and not specifically told to save anyone.


He utterly embarrassed himself in front of everyone and stormed out of the hall.


Well,typical Roderick. Always caring only for himself.It would be a disaster to have someone like him as the Alpha King.


Watching Jaris execute wisdom and escaping all the rooms was mind-blowing. Now, my heart won't stop fluttering since he made it out of the final room.


I'd always known he was smart. But Jaris was not entirely kind. So, seeing him help the girl on her knees only proved how very/intelligent he was.


And well, what could I say? Women love intelligent men.


'Too bad there isn't a world where you two exist,Lyric.


The trial went on for the two remaining Alphas. Alpha Zarek passed, while the last Alpha failed.


That made four winners and six losers.


The hall erupted into cheers-coming from the members of the Alphas that had won.


A meeting was called for them and I had to accompany Jaris. In a separate room, the Alphas were addressed by the Chairman and representatives. A new date was announced for the second trial, and enough luck was dished out to them.



I caught Alpha Zarek staring at me, mutiple times.

But it wasn't carnal. Instead, he gave me that guilty look.



I couldn't exactly get what his problem was. If he had something to say, why couldn't he just spit it out already?


I felt nervous sitting next to Jaris during the ride home.If we were on good terms, I'd have given him a hug for his awesome performance.


But he was a rude jerk who might probably snap at me for even thinking of doing that to him.


Reaching Darkspire, we met a huge welcome party.Judging by Jaris' reaction, he didn't know about this.The members must have planned it ahead in anticipation for his win.


A red carpet was placed on the floor beneath the car doors where Jaris and I was supposed to step out from.They opened the door for us and we stepped out the same time, him from the left, and me from the right.


They shouted and clapped and threw RIBBONS in the air as we alighted. I laughed heartily, finding the whole show just adorable.


They weren't just celebrating Jaris. They were celebrating me as his Luna.


Luna Isolde was the first to walk up to us. She hugged Jaris and kissed him on the cheek."Congratulations, son. You were amazing."


Jaris simply nodded before pulling away from her hold.



Next came the kids, and Marta behind them.


"Daddy! I heard you won!" Xyla with the loudest voice.


"Oh, yes, darling. I did." Jaris carried them both in his arms, then planted a kiss on both their heads.


More people came to congratulate him. Walking on the red carpet, we were led to the large party hall.
###Chapter 74
LYRIC


The party was beyond magnificent. It was heart-warming to see how much Jaris was loved by his people.


There was a lot to eat, drink and talk about.The people of Darkspire were quite united. I could tell from how they gathered in groups and made jokes like one big family.


A family I'd never had.


"Hello, Luna." Someone nudged me from behind.


I rolled my eyes as Jace stood beside me.


"Hi, dad." I lifted my glass to my lips to take a sip,but he snatched the flute from me, drinking instead.


"I like how you pay me some respect. It shows l trained you well." "You're an asshole, Jace." I slapped him on the shoulder."You just coming?"


"Yeah. Had to stay back with my dad to discuss certain things."


Kael walked up to us, holding a flute that was almost empty.


"Congratulations, Lyric." His tone was clipped. The man was effortlessly grumpy even when he was attempting to be nice.


"For what?" I chuckled. "Alpha Jaris was the one who displayed his smartness, not me."


"Well, it's what they say. When the Alpha gets celebrated, so does his Luna."



His Luna.



The words warmed my heart more than I cared to admit.


I flicked my gaze toward Jaris in the corner,and there he was, staring back at me even though he was in the midst of six elders. I knew he was there because I'd been stealing glances at him the whole time.


He looked away as quickly as I did, but not before heat radiated through my core.


Gods, I needed to find a way to stop this. I couldn't keep doing this to myself.


Kael's eyes roamed over Jace's body. "Why don't you try to get a bigger size of this next time? I don't even understand if you lack the common knowledge of your measurement." He was referring to Jace's suit.



Jace glanced down at his suit and scoffed. "Dude,get out of my face before I smash yours against the wall."



Kael looked at me. "How do you cope being his friend, Lyric? I'd rather be alone than have to spend a second with someone like him who hates correction as much as he hates having a brain."


Oh,for Moon's sake! "Guys, this is a party. You can't do this here."


But Jace was not one to lose a barb. "It's hilarious that you think being alone is preferable when it clearly suits your personality so well."


I looked around the room. Or rather, looked at Jaris.He was staring at us-me.


I swallowed the tight lump in my throat, then whispered. "Alpha Jaris is watching."


Kael's features softened. He looked disgusted, then did something Jace and I would never have imagined. To our utmost shock, he lifted his hand to Jace's hair, stroking it.


My mouth fell open as Jace's brows shot up to his hairline. For three seconds, he was too shocked to react.



When he regained composure, he slapped Kael's hand away. "What the fuck, man? Have you lost it!?"


This time, I was speechless, my gaze flicking between the two men. Why would Kael do that in public?


"Relax. I hate it as much as you do." The detest in his voice didn't make me doubt him. "Like she said, Jaris was watching. I had to put on a show."


"What fucking show? What business does your show have with touching me?" Jace was trying to keep his temper down. If we weren't in a party, he'd have definitely reacted much worse.


"Why do you think you're here in Darkspire, standing close to and touching Lyric however you want?" Kael rasped. "You really think Jaris decided to be so generous?"


"Well, I asked what your excuse was to him, but you didn't fucking tell me."


"You're smart, Jace." Kael shrugged, but he was pissed. "I guess you should know now."


Seconds passed. The truth dawned on me same time Jace's jaw dropped. He must've realized it was well.


"No. Don't fucking say," he shook his head. "| ain't doing that shit with you? What are you,stupid?"


"Fuck, I'd never seen anyone more ungrateful than you, asshole." Kael gritted.


"What the hell are you saying? Are your brain cells that dumb that you couldn't come up with a better excuse?"



Kael stepped closer. "He asked, okay? He thought that was the only reason I'd want you here. It made sense when he brought it up. So I agreed for your sake. I told him I liked your stupid ass and wanted to have you close. That's the only reason he doesn't bother when you're with Lyric."


"Fucking hell!" Jace angrily dropped his glass on the table. His eyes blazed when he faced Kael again."Well, you're on your own, bud. And bear this in mind, the next time you touch me like you just did,I promise it'll be the last time you have fingers." Thank goodness the hall was heavy with music.I wouldn't want to imagine people's reaction to a conversation like this.


"Jace..." I tried to speak to him, but he walked out on us.


Woah. I hadn't seen Jace this mad in a while.






A while later, I went out to look for Jace. He had been gone for about fifteen minutes, making me worried.


Fortunately, I found him by the pool side, smoking.I froze. Jace doesn't smoke unless he's really pissed.Like,very very pissed.


At this point,I wanted to believe he was overreacting over what Kael did.



"Hey. Give me that." I gently took the cigarette from me.


Putting it on the floor, I extinguished it with my heels.


I crossed my arms as I faced him. "Don't you think your reaction was a little over the top? Kael was only trying to help."


"Please, Lyric. Don't start with me." He pinched the bridge of his nose, his eyes closed.


He was clearly trying to control his temper around me.


"Okay, dad." I huffed


There. That was enough to get a smile.


He took a deep breath, inserting his both hands into his pockets. He looked a bit calmer now.



"What happened?" My voice was mellow. "You know you can talk to me."


Something must have happened in the past to get such a reaction out of him.


"Forget it." He shook his head. "Sorry I took you out of the party. We should head back."


Hm. Jace being polite to me. He was definitely not himself.
I knew him well enough to know if he didn't want to talk about something, he wouldn't. So, I let it be for now.


Grabbing him by the jacket, we started walking back to the party. But we stopped when we bumped into Marta.


She was making a phone call and appeared shocked when she saw us.


It took me a moment to realize she wasn't being shocked at me, but the man beside me.


"Karen?" Jace called, squinting his eyes like he couldn't believe it.



My brows furrowed in surprise. What was he saying?"That's not...Karen."



Jace looked at me like I'd just told him the moon was pink.


Marta lowered the phone from her ear, but I wasn't even sure she'd ended the call. I'd never seen her this pale before. It was the exact way she looked when she had seen him in the bar.


"She is. I know her, Lyric. Do you know her?" Jace asked, having the tone of someone that had just met an old acquaintance.



"You don't know me," Marta spoke up, her voice a little shaky. She cleared her throat, and when she spoke again, she sounded more like herself."I don't know you either. She's right. I'm not Karen."


She clicked something on her phone, probably ending her call and turned to leave.


"What're you saying? Don't you remember me?"Jace chuckled. "It's me, Jace. I know it's been years but we met in-"


"I said I don't know you!" Her voice was near a shout,her eyes blazing fire.


Her mask slipped. She wasn't just furious. She was scared.



Time seemed to stretch between the two. Marta glared at me, then at Jace, and walked away. "What was that about?" | turned to Jace as soon as we were alone. "How's she Karen to you? That's Marta Monroe. Jaris' baby mama."


Jace's eyes rounded, disbelief glintingin them.


"She's the mother of the twins?"



"Yes. The very bitch I've been telling you about."


Jace shook his head, his eyes on the floor.


"Hey, what's wrong?" I touched his arm.


His forehead was creased. "Hold on, did you say the kids' birthday is in three weeks?"


"Yes?"



"What year were they born?"


"2020." His questions were putting me on the edge.

"Talk to me, Jace. What's going on?"


"That means.." he shook his head.not possible."





"What isn't possible?" "She being their mother, Lyric!" He darted his gaze at me. "I met Karen...or Marta in 2020, just around this time. And when I did meet her, she wasn't pregnant."
###Chapter 75 
LYRIC


Time went still for a long while.


My head spun from the revelation.


I shook my head, looking in the direction Marta had just taken.



"I-I think you're mistaken, Jace. Maybe you're mistaking the month or-"



"I can forget anything, but not Karen or what we shared in that brief moment. We met on the thirteen of June. Does that sound too precise for you?"



He took a deep breath, running his fingers through his hair. "While I was overseas, I met her in Oryndor.We happened to be in the same hotel. I was in the lounge area, drinking when she came up to me. She started the conversation, and well, I was bored and played along. Next thing, we both end up in my room."



I gasped, lifting a hand to my mouth. "Y-You had sex!?"


"Well, we wouldn't be reading in my room, Lyric. So,yes."



Goodness!



"She told me she'd simply been horny and wanted it to be a one-time stuff. But the next day, we had more sex. Look, what happened between us isn't the point here. The point is, Marta was never pregnant. She should have been eight months pregnant when I met her right? I touched that belly. And trust me when l say there were no twins in it."



"Oh, gods." My hand was on my chest. I feared I might have a panic attack. I looked at my best friend with all seriousness. "Please, tell me you're not mistaken. What if it's just someone that looks like her?" "Come on, Ly. Wouldn't this explain why she has been scared around me? We met in a very far country. We both didn't know each other and didn't expect we'd find ourselves here. That's the reason she's shocked. I'm thinking she must have traveled under the guise of birthing the kids outside the country. She must've been so desperate for Jaris'attention that she'd set up something like this to give him kids."


"Jace!" I squealed. This was no small revelation.My fingers were practically shaking. "If Marta wasn't pregnant... does this mean Xyla and Xylon do not belong to Jaris!?"


He shrugged, but I could see the sadness in his eyes too. "That's the bitter truth, Lyric. Jaris has been taking care of another man's kids."

Her hands wouldn't stop shaking on the wheel.Her face was streaked with tears, she considered it a miracle she didn't run into a car the entire drive.


She parked carelessly in the middle of the compound, jumped out of the car and ran into the house.


She's always hated her family home and only came when she was repeatedly summoned. But today, she came of her own accord. She was losing her mind and needed their help.


She barged into the living room and found her narcissistic sister kissing a man on the couch.One of their guards.


They quickly disengaged at her abrupt entrance,shocked.


"What the hell,Marta!?"


"Where's everyone? Where's grandma?" She panted.


"Grandma is upstairs. And why are you looking like your life is about to end?"


Any other day, Marta would've had a good time replying her sister. But not tonight.


She ran up the stairs and barged into her grandmother's room without knocking.


The woman had been sitting by the bed and looked around in fright.


"Marta Monroe. Have you finally lost it?" She rasped.She hated such abrupt entrance.


"Grandma please," Marta fell on her knees, fresh tears running down her cheeks. "I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. I don't-I don't know what to do."


Her grandmother regarded her with a cold expression. But since she hadn't yelled at her, Marta figured she must be interested in what she had to say.


"Now what trouble have you gotten yourself into?"Her voice was less scolding.


"It's about the kids. Someone... Someone is about to expose me."

###Chapter 76

 LYRIC



I laid in the bathtub, one leg splayed over the top with my head leaning backward.


It had been a long day. A crazy one. All I wanted to do was get some sleep.


Staring into nothing, I thought of Jace's discovery.I still had a hard time believing what he said. Of course, Jace was my best friend, and he'd never lie with something this serious. I just couldn't believe Marta could be that heartless and fearless.



How could she risk lying to the entire Darkspire? Like she was so certain the truth wouldn't reveal itself one day.


I tsked, thinking of the poor kids. Who were their real parents? And how would they feel getting to know that the parents they've come to love weren't theirs? What would Jaris do when he learns the truth?


So many questions, it frightened me.


I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath. I decided to think of something better. And of course, the only 'better' memory I could come up with was the one of him.


Before I could stop myself, my fingers were already on my wet core. I bit my lower lip, trying to suppress my moan, but in the end I failed. They came out just as shamelessly as I touched myself to a weird dream.


My scream echoed in the bathroom as I made myself cum. I panted heavily, squirming in the tub.


Coming down from my high, I was too exhausted to move a limb, and before I knew it, I was shedding tears.



I cried because it was too good. Cried because I wanted more but couldn't even have it. It was a stupid dream. How can a stupid dream have this effect on me?

JARIS


If Marta hadn't come in when she did, I was certain the pen would've snapped in my hand.


"Where were you, Marta? I called like an hour ago,"I growled.


I was running low on temper. Damn it This wasn't good.


"I'm... I'm sorry, Alpha. My grandmother called for me. I just got back and came running when I heard you summoned me."


I regarded her.


'Came running', yet she's had the time to change into one of her red lace nighties.


'Came running', yet she's had the time to shower and brush her hair, judging from how damp her hair looked.



'Came running,' yet she's had the time to apply purple lipstick on her lips.


Marta looked fucking gorgeous right now. Since we met, she's been desperate for my attention and had been doing all she could to get it.


She's put in more effort to seduce me than Lyric Harper has ever done. As a matter of fact, Lyric had never done anything seducing.


Yet, here I was, being tormented by my memory of her.


I stood up, my chair groaning as I did.


I was still wearing my suit pants and white top, only the jacket missing.


"Come here, Marta," I ordered impatiently.


She did, walking sensually.


The bulge in my pants was almost painful.


You can do this, Jaris. You can take control.


When she was close, I grabbed her by the neck, slamming my lips against hers. She moaned in response, throwing her arms around me and deepening the kiss.


I can do this-l repeatedly told myself. I can use Marta as a distraction. I can get Lyric out of my head.


Yet, as I let my hands roam over Marta's body, they didn't feel like 'hers'. They didn't bring out the kind of response Lyric did. Her hair didn't fucking smell like apple shampoo!


She was different. She wasn't strong enough to get Lyric out of my head.


No!



I pushed her to the edge of the table, wrapping her legs around my waist. Her hands were already working to unbutton my shirt.


This shouldn't be difficult. I was already as hard as rock since she came into the room. She was horny for me too. All I had to do was take out my dick and fuck her senseless. Get it all out. Even if I won't be able to cum, it'll bring me some kind of peace.


I wanted more than just jerking myself in the bathroom. I wanted to feel myself deep inside her cunt, moving my hips and filling her up with my cum.


What the hell has Lyric done to me? Why can't I think straight? Why can't I want anyone but her?


With a hiss, I pulled away from Marta, my thumb caressing my lower lip. My shirt was parted into two.Marta's eyes were heavy with lust. She looked like she wanted to cry from the loss of contact.


"Jaris..." She stretched her hand to touch me, to pull me close. But I didn't let her.


She wasn't Lyric. No one could ever be.


For a moment, I contemplated if it had to do with the mate bond? Could it be the reason I was so desperate for her?


Then, I remembered these delusions already started even before the mate bond. This... This was something different. "Get out, Marta," I rasped, turning toward the bathroom.



Her gasp was audible. "J-Jaris..."


I didn't give her the chance to speak. I know a lot must be going through her head. It was the second time I was giving her hope. But I was just as hopeless.


And as I pleasured myself with my hands in the bathroom, I came to a conclusion: I was done managing without Lyric Harper. The Moon knows I tried. I fucking tried to keep her out of the way. But now, I was done.


I was getting a taste of Lyric tomorrow.
###Chapter 77 
JACE



Jace waited on the passage leading to Marta's room.


He had been there for fifteen minutes, leaning against the wall and his hands crossed over his chest.



He had somewhere important to be that morning,but it could wait.Seeing Marta was more important.


Finally, she appeared from her room, making a phone call.


"No. He's not to be given more than two mm." She spoke into the phone. But that was before she saw Jace.



She came to an abrupt halt, her eyes glistening with shock. Jace  pushed away from the wall but kept his hands across his chest. He looked horribly intimidating this way.


Marta swallowed hard. Time seemed to stretch.


"I'll call you back," her voice was softer this time as she spoke into the phone before ending the call.


"Hi, Marta," Jace tipped his head toward her. "How have you been?"


He could clearly see her throat bob.


"Tell me," he went closer. "Did you choose Karen just because it was pretty? Or you really didn't want me to know who you were?"


Finally, she regained her footing. Her mean face was back. "I don't know who you're talking about."


She tried to move away, but Jace stepped into her way. "Uh-Uh. You don't get to do this, Marta. We're having this conversation."


"We have nothing to talk about!" She rasped. "Do l need to report you to the Alpha for harassment? Why won't you leave me alone? I am not Karen. I sure as hell have never seen you before."


She glared at him, from head to heel, then walked past him.


"You know why I'm so concerned, don't you?" Jace turned in her direction, but she didn't stop walking."I'm concerned because when we met, you were supposed to be pregnant. But you and I know you weren't."


Now,she stopped.


He walked up to her this time, standing in front of her again. "So, if you're so sure we haven't met before,I'm pretty sure you wouldn't mind performing a test on those kids. Especially when I bring it up to Jaris."


Her mask took a little tumble. Her fear was evident now. She could pass out at any moment if Jace didn't stop talking.


Her frightened eyes darted around the passage,making sure there was no one around.


When she spoke again, her voice was shaky and a "You?" Jace scoffed, staring down at her. "I didn't even know you were here until last night, Marta.I don't 'want' anything from you. I just want you to confirm I'm not lying. Do you remember me or not?"



Her eyes glistened, like she could shed a tear any minute. She looked around the passage, took a deep breath, and hissed. "Fine. I know. You. So what?"


Hm. Jace chuckled. She was still trying to be feisty even when the odds were not in her favor.


"Good. Then, you should remember that I'm aware you were never pregnant when you should be.How're the kids yours?"


She fisted her hands beside her. "You're delusional if you think I'd be lying to the Alpha all these years.He's the father of my kids. I gave birth a month before we met."



"Are you kidding me? We met in June, and the kids'birthday is coming up in July. How do the two relate?"



"T-There's a reason we fixed their birthday next month. They were born prematurely, so we kept them in an incubator and decided to make July their official birth month since it was the very moment they were meant to be delivered."


"Really? So, you expect he to believe you were sleeping around when you'd just given birth a month ago or less? It doesn't make any sense!"


"Well, it's my life and I'm telling you to mind your business!"



The atmosphere was taut with tension. Marta's chest heaved anxiously. She looked like she could strangle Jace to death with her bare hands if she could.



"Okay." He shrugged. "Like I said, I'm sure you wouldn't mind performing a test on the kids. You know, I'm also curious and want to be sure."


This time, it was his turn to walk away. Marta hesitated for a beat before she ran after him. "What do you want from me!?" She yelled in frustration. "What makes you think you can just come in here and ruin everything l've worked years for?"


Jace met her gaze. "Ooh. Careful, Marta. You sound like you're about to get caught for something."


She held his gaze with defiance. "My life is not perfect. But I've been working so hard to make sure I'm in a better place. I won't let you ruin me, Jace.If l have to die, I'll take you with me. You have my word."


As much as her eyes were stained with red and glistened with unshed tears, they also glinted with fury.



She walked out on him.







LYRIC


Sitting in my car, I watched Marta leave the house and knew she was done talking with Jace. Or maybe arguing.
 It didn't take long before Jace joined me in the car,taking the passenger seat.


"She denied it," he sighed.


That didn't surprise me. "I told you she would. This is quite heavy. No one would easily admit to something like that."


"That woman is unbelievable, Lyric! She's deceiving the Alpha and entire Darkspire with somebody else's kids! It's worse than fraud!"


I took a deep breath, staring out the window.


"I'm telling Jaris."


I snapped my head at Jace."What? Jace,no!"


"What do you mean 'no'?"


"Could you just... calm down a little? I still need to make my findings before I know what to do."


"Excuse me?" He tapped me on the head. "You sound like you made this discovery all by yourself.This is my discovery, Ly. I'm the one who gets to decide what to do."


"I-I know. But this is going too fast, I think." I drew a full breath. "Just calm down, okay? I'll ask some questions today, just to get our facts right. After that,we'll make our decision."


Jade eyed me suspiciously. "Are you worried about the kids?"



I kept my eyes on the steering, knowing he got me.


"You're worried Jaris might kick them out if he learns the truth."


I still couldn't say anything. The idea of Xyla and Xylon being hated by a man they've grown to love and recognize as their father was too uncomfortable for me. They wouldn't be the only ones to get hurt,but Jaris too. I've seen how he loves them. This news would break him more than it would the kids.



"Listen to me, Lyric. Those pumpkins are adorable.I wouldn't want to hurt them either. But you know how much I detest lies. I'm a man, Lyric. I won't sit back 
and watch my fellow man raise kids that aren't his."


"| know!" My voice was feeble. "Just give me a moment,Jace.Please.Can you?"


He rolled his eyes. "Get to work, Lyric," he muttered and left the car.



＊＊＊＊十



My spirit was crushed by the whole situation.


Reaching TCH, I tried to focus on work.


I had a couple of patients to attend to, and I did so,using my abyssal gloves. Their conditions weren't too critical. So, it was something my basic knowledge could help with.


Next to the ward of one of the patients I visited, there was a man with a critical condition.I saw him through the window and stopped to watch him.


He was asleep and looked like he'd been there for a long time.


When I asked the nurse with me, she told me had been in that coma for a month. According to her,he was suffering from Lunar Lungs Collapse. They'd been trying all they could to revive him and have given up hope on treating him. Even his own family had stopped visiting.


I felt so bad for him. The man looked old and frail.Being in a coma at this age... I didn't want to imagine how painful it must be for him.


I left with the nurse. But an hour later, when I was meant to be on break, I returned to the room.


'It'll be fine, Lyric. No one is watching. No one would be able to tell it was you.' I assured myself.


I took off my gloves and placed a hand on his neck and one on his forehead. He'd already been given the right medications, but the ailment was too strong and was fighting against the drugs.


So, all that needed to be done was to Siphon the sickness away. I wasn't supposed to do this, but he was an old helpless man. 
Closing my eyes, I focused on the ailment and felt heavier. I'd always felt this way whenever I touched sick people. I just never realized it was my body receiving the ailment. Good thing I never get to actually fall sick.


Being a Siphon would've been cool if it didn't have a dangerous side. If my kind wasn't haunted.


In a couple of minutes, I was done. I could feel that it was over.


I smiled down at the man. His face was already getting brighter.


"Hope to see you awake soon, sir." I smied down at him, my hand tapping his shoulder. I turned away to leave but a hand suddenly grabbed mine. I was startled.



Whipping around, I discovered it was the man. His eyes were open, weakly so. But he was staring at me.


Oh.He's awake.


I took a deep breath. He didn't have to give me such a scare.


"Cy...n", he muttered something I couldn't hear. He was still very weak.


"Sir? How're you feeling, sir?" I asked happily.


He uttered the word again. The third time, it was clearer:


"Si...phon."
###Chapter 78 

LYRIC



My eyes grew large, shining as brightly as the sun.


My world came spinning, crashing down and building up again just to crash even more painfully.


All this happened in seconds.


I opened my mouth to speak, but no words formed. I couldn't get my head straight.


"Siphon," he repeated, crystal clear this time.


"I-" I tried to swallow, but the ball of nerves was too much in my throat. I couldn't gulp.


I inhaled deeply and tried again. "I'll get someone to check on you."


It wasn't until I tried to run that I realized he was still holding my hand. Now that he was awake, the man was strong.


I panicked, my eyes darting to the door and back.


"Let me go." It was a plea. "Please."


He finally did, his eyes growing soft.


He breathed deeply, closing his eyes.


"Siphon," he repeated, even as it seemed like he was going back to sleep.


I didn't wait around to hear more. I sprinted out of the room, my heart pounding against my ribs.


I didn't stop until I was in the nearest restroom and shut the door.


Damn it. Damn it. Damn it!


I pulled at the root of my shirt, pacing the small room.


He knew what I was. But how... How could he easily tell? Did I make a mistake saving him?


Jace was right. I shouldn't have cared about saving anyone. I should've kept it hidden like I planned. I spent a long time in the restroom, too scared to go out. What if he was already screaming my secret to everyone?


A knock on my door startled me.


What the hell?



"Use the other rooms!" I shouted in frustration.



"Lyric."


I froze. Geez, it was Marta. What did she want?


My eyes rounded. Oh, no. What if she knows?


I quickly opened the door, eager to know if my life was doomed or not.


She regarded me coldly, like I was dirt in her way."You've been there for too long. What're you doing?"


Okay. It didn't seem like she knew.



I took a deep breath to calm my nerves.


"Why are you monitoring me?" I frowned. Did she see me run out of the man's room? Please tell me she didn't.


"Anyway, you can be dying for all I care. I came here to pass an important information across." She crossed her arms over her chest, and there she was-the bitchy Marta I knew.


She looked like a mean doctor in her lab coat.


"Tell your friend to steer clear from me. I don't know what his problem is, and I really don't care. Just tell him not to rub it off on me."


My mind drifted to the issue she had with Jace. Oh,right. She was in a shitty position right now.


"If you have an issue with Jace, you should settle it with him. What does that have to do with me?"I frowned.



Her expression turned into something else. Her eyes became darker, like a serpent about to spit out venom.



"You don't understand, do you?" Her voice was dangerously low. "You don't understand the implications,do you?"


This was a different side of Marta. I'd never seen her this vile before her.


Before I could brace myself for what to do next, she slapped me hard across the face.


My head reeled to the side, a gasp slipping past my throat as I put a hand over my mouth.


I was beyond shocked. Marta slapped me!


Her eyes were as wide and burning as that of a mad woman. Who would've thought that the issue with the kids would be enough to make Marta lose her mind?


"I'll ruin you, Lyric." She pointed an angry finger at me. "You and your worthless friend. I'll take you both to the ground and bury you so deep if you don't stay away from me and my family. My kids are my family,and I'll never let you jeopardize that. Let it sink!"


Before I could think better of it, my hands flew to her hair, roughly pulling at her roots. But despite the rage in my chest, I was still held back by the fact that this was a professional ground. We shouldn't be doing this here. Marta, however, didn't seem to care, and she used how reluctant my hold was to push me off.


"Don't ever lay your filthy hands on me," she snarled.


"Same goes for you, Marta!" I half-yelleld. "This should be the first and last time you ever think of hitting me. What do you think I am, stupid? If we weren't in TCH right now, I promise, you'd have been on the floor by now."


"Oh,spare me," she snorted. "This is only a little warning. You can be sure to expect more if you and your asshole of a friend don't stay away from my business."



She turned around to leave, but I grabbed her hand,bringing her back.


I let her see the seriousness in my eyes when I spoke to her. "Like I said, if you have an issue with Jace, go settle it with him. Don't expect me to keep quiet when he's trying to uncover an important truth." I tilted my head to the side. "Or isn't that the truth,Marta? Do you think he's lying?"


Her eyes turned to icicles. But I couldn't care less.


I released her wrist and walked away, still hating the fact that she had the nerves to slap me and I wasn't able to do much about it.

JARIS


I was at the office, reviewing some files with my CMO when Kael walked in.


His presence was thrilling and enough to make me dismiss the CMO in front of me.


"I believe you have the package?" I asked eagerly as he came to take the seat the CMO had just been spitting on.


He gave me that reluctant look before slipping his hand into his pocket and returning with a small pack of pills.



He dropped it on the table.


"Went through a lot of trouble to get this. You know it's forbidden."


I felt a cold sensation as I picked up the pack,observing the pack like it was a pack of gold.


"If it was truly forbidden, it'd stop being produced," I muttered without looking at him. "What about the second stuff?"


Again, he sighed, as if being reluctant with his answer. "It's in the car."



I nodded, satisfaction brimming inside me. "Go get the car ready, then. We're heading home."


He stood up and was about to open the door when he paused and looked at me. "You know you don't have to do this, right? It's not exactly... noble."


I was almost tempted to roll my eyes, bored with the conversation. "When have I ever been noble? You must be confusing my status for nobility."


"Come on, J. You know what I'm talking about."


"No, I don't, and I don't even want to know. Now,get going."


Kael wasn't a nice man. He'd done a lot of pretty bad things in his life. Yet, here he was, counselling me like some grandfather.


Laughable.


Using my landline, I called my assistant to come to the office. In seconds, she was there. I asked her to pack up my things and follow me to the car.


As soon as we reached Darkspire, I took the things from Kael and went into Lyric's room. Of course, I'd have a spare key with me.


It took me an hour to set up the first stuff, then droppeda single pill and a note on her dresser.


I stood with my hands in my pockets, staring at the pill. I tried. The Moon knows I tried for it not to come to this. Kael was right. This was wrong. But I couldn't bring myself to care anymore. I've never been a good man. No. I've done a lot of bad things that doesn't give me the privilegeto be called good.


You could say I'm a good leader, but not a good man.


And maybe, Lyric deserved this for messing with my head.
###Chapter 79
LYRIC



I was glad when my shift came to an end. My day had been ruined from the moment I healed that man that all I wanted to do was get home and have some sleep.


I passed by the room of the man I'd healed, just to peep through the window.


I couldn't help but wonder if he'd ratted me out already.How was he even able to tell what I was?


I slackened my steps when I neared the door and found Guinevere outside the room without another doctor. I couldn't make out what they were saying,but it bothered me.



What if the man had told them and they were thinking of the best way to capture me?
Oh, stop it, Lyric. Stop being so negative.


If only it was that easy.


The second doctor left before I got to the spot to meet Guinevere. I looked out for the woman's expression. This would determine if she knows something or not.


"Lyric. How was your day?" She sounded normal.


I took a deep breath. "I'm fine, Doctor Guinevere."


I faced the window. The man was asleep.


"Is he uh...better? I heard he was in a coma."


"Ah, yes. He miraculously woke up today."


"Oh." I nodded, my stomach tightening with nervousness. "How did that happen? I mean, did we have to do something special? Or did he-"


"It's all thanks to Marta," she cut me off, speaking in a whisper.


It took me a moment to wrap my head around the revelation. "Wait,what?"


"The man was her patient. And when I asked her, she said she had tried something new on him this morning which was the reason he regained consciousness."


My head spun, my mouth dropping open. What in the name of Selene? Marta was taking the glory for something she didn't do?


Now that I thought of it, Guinevere never asked questions concerning the surgery that was performed on Mr. Owens. I never wanted her to know it was me, but she never even tried to know who did it.



"I-I see." I blinked rapidly, coughing to clear the sudden heaviness in my throat.


"She's quite good. And she wants it to remain a secret. Doesn't want the whole attention, you know?"


Oh, for Selene's sake! Marta was more unbelievable than I thought. Of course, she'd want it to remain a secret because it wasn't her doing!


"Was she...also the one that performed surgery on Mr. Owens?" Guinevere looked at me when I asked."You know, I'd seenher go into the surgical ward but didn't know if..." I shrugged, wanting her to complete the statement.


I tried to remain calm, but inside, I was burning with rage.


Guinevere hesitated before nodding.


"Actually, yes. She performed the surgery alone and didn't want anyone to know about it."


My eyes widened like saucers.


Guinevere must think I'm shocked because I didn't know Marta could do such amazing things. She didn't know I was being shocked that Marta could be such a lying bitch!


She was taking the glory for what I did! And while I didn't want anyone knowing it was me, it still hurt to see someone lie confidently with my efforts. Could she be any worse?


"She's unbelievable," I huffed, but I didn't think Guinevere heard me.



"Did you say something,dear?"


I shook my head. I'd only be shooting myself in the leg if I told her Marta was lying.


"How's the man? Has he said anything since hewoke up?"


She explained to me that he'd mostly been sleeping and hadn't spoken much. She also told me who he was. He was just a regular member from a neighboring Pack.


"The few times he was awake, he's been insisting on meeting the doctor that saved him. So, Marta will be coming to see him soon."


My heart skipped a frantic beat. He wants to see me.


But now, Marta has claimed the glory.


No! What if he calls Marta what he called me? Or would he be able to tell that we're different?


Guinevere's phone rang, and she excused herself to pick it.


I stared at the man for some time. He was deep asleep. There was nothing I could do.






I returned home with this deep ache in my heart.I hated that I was this troubled.


Gods, I should've listened to Jace.


I dropped my bag on the bed and was about taking off my jewelry in front of the dresser when my eyes caught onto something on the table.


My brows furrowed as I picked it up, wanting to have a clear look at it. And when I read the note, my breath froze.
 
###Chapter 80 

MARTA



She walked into the patient's room with Guinevere.She had to wait around since the man was demanding for her and was called as soon as he was awake.


"Mr. Pete. How're you feeling?" She asked with a warm smile.



The man might have been sleeping for a long time,but he still looked dizzy.


He shifted his eyes to Guinevere. "I asked for the woman that healed me."



"You did. And she's in front of you," Guinevere furrowed her brows.



The man gave Marta a long stare before shaking his head. "She's not... She's not."

Chills spread through Marta's abdomen. This was the reason she had been reluctant to see him. But Guinevere kept insisting, saying their patient's satisfaction was important. And there wasn't much Marta could do to go against her superior.


She put up one of her best smiles as she addressed him again. "Sir, I understand that you've been in coma for a long time. You're probably confused and-"



"No. I saw her. I know what she looks like. I need to see her."



Marta's countenance fell. It was a good thing Guinevere was standing behind her and couldn't see the soured expression on her face.


"Mr. Rete, a lot of people come and go in this room.Nurses had to come in every single day to check on you. You're probably mistaking one of them for this woman. You're my patient, and I'm telling you, I was the one who brought you out of coma."


Still, the man shook his head, not convinced. He knew what the doctor looked like.


"She was beautiful," he voiced out, his eyes staring distantly at the ceiling. "Had green eyes, oval face,long hair." He sighed, his shoulders slumping."She was very beautiful. You're not her."


Marta's hands balled into fists.


"Could he be referring to Lyric?" Guinevere asked from behind, sending more fear to Marta's heart.


She could count the number of doctors that had those eyes, and judging from how beautiful the man claimed this person was, Guinevere could only think of Lyric.


"I-I don't think so," Marta stuttered, turning to the woman. "He's just very confused. I believe when he's rested enough, he'll see that he's mistaken."


The man shook his head, wanting to protest, but Marta put a hand on his shoulder. "You should sleep now,Mr.Pete."


But Guinevere spoke again, further complicating things for her. "Don't worry. I'll bring the doctor have in mind to you tomorrow. You'll tell me if she was the one or not."

'If you want to have more of that dream, take this.You have a choice.



I read the note over and over again, wanting to be sure I wasn't mistaken.



Who left this in my room? How can anyone even have access to my lockedroom?



More importantly, how does anyone know about my dream?



I paced the room for minutes, digging my fingers into my hair, trying to make sense of the note.


My dream.



The one with Jaris. The one where I wanted more.


Of course, I'd been craving for more since it happened. But this...this note didn't seem right. Did Jaris send it?


No, he didn't. Jaris didn't like me. He wouldn't want to have anything to do with me.


But what was this pill?


I took it out of the small pack and observed it in my palm. I'd never seen it before. What if it was something dangerous?







Hours passed.



I couldn't eat.


Even Jace could tell there was something wrong when he came to check up on me. He asked, but l couldn't tell him the truth I couldn't tell him l'd been having sex dreams with Jaris, and now,someone just offered to help me keep having those dreams. I'd planned on questioning the twins' nanny today to know about their birth, but the pill had completely taken over my mind.


Even until midnight, I couldn't sleep.


I stood in front of the dresser, holding the pill in my hand.What kind of dream would I have if I took this?How different would it be from the one that happened the last time?


Despite how dangerous it was to take something strange given by someone unknown, I couldn't deny the fact that I was curious and wanted this. We might be at loggerheads in reality, but I wanted to feel more of him in my dream. I wanted him to kiss me.Wanted him to touch me more than he did the last time.



If I die being curious...well. I shrugged.


I looked at the time.It was past midnight.


My door was locked. Nobody could come into the room. And even if they do, at least, I'd be able to see their face at last.

 I was only going to enjoy the dream. That's it.


Taking a deep breath, I popped the pill into my mouth and swallowed with water.
###Chapter 81

LYRIC



I was shocked by how sudden the effect was. My head swirled, the room going in circles.


What the...


I lost my balance and would have dropped to the floor if I wasn't standing near the dresser to grip it tight.


Oh, gods. What have I done? What did I take!?


The sensation was worse than being drunk. It was just as if I'd been drugged by something heavier than my body could take.


Dragging my legs and swinging my arms around, I managed to reach the bed. But I didn't get to climb it as I ended up on the floor, my head resting on the edge.

I closed my eyes, my heart pounding in my ears.


After a few minutes, it felt better.


Not just better,but euphoric.


I giggled at the insane sensation.


My entire body seemed to be at so much peace. It felt like I was stuck between sleep and consciousness.


Was I in the dream already? If I was, then where was he? Where was Jaris? Where was the man that hated me,yet made me feel good in my dreams?


I knew the moment my door opened.


＊＊＊＊＋＊＊＊＊十十



JARIS



I knew Lyric was being tormented, just like me. 1overheard her telling her friend about the dream and how bothered she was about it.


She wanted this as much as I did. But the both of us could never bring ourselves to face reality.We could never admit it to ourselves or ever let it happen in reality.


So, this was the only way to go about it. By leaving it in the dream.


And that was all it was ever going to be. A dream.


She was on the floor when I walked in, her head propped on the bed. She was dressed, ready for bed,wearing a black transparent lace nightie. I'd be lying if I said it didn't look good on her. Everything about Lyric looked 'good', and it bothered me.


Grabbing her in my arms, I placed her on the bed.She stirred awake, though her lids were still heavy.


"Jaris.." she moaned, lifting a hand to touch my cheek."You came."


Funny how she never called me 'Alpha' when she's like this. She was more audacious this way.


My name had no business sounding so seductive on her tongue. No one called it the way she does.
Lyric Harper. Who exactly was she?


I gently stroke her hair, taking note of her eyes as they go close.


She wrapped her arms around me, fueling my desire.


"Kiss me," it was below a whisper. If I wasn't so close to her, I wouldn't have heard. "Please."


My dick jerked in my pants.


I'd never do this with the conscious Lyric. She probably would never want to do it with me either.But in this little world we've just created, I wanted to do much more to her.


I wanted to claim her and make her feel like mine.


It was only going to remain here, in our illusion. By morning, she would feel me but would still think this was a dream.


But me? I'd be plagued with these memories all day.


When she pulled me with her hand arouInd me,I gave what she asked. I kissed her. Savagely. Hungrily.I didn't have much patience in me tonight.


I lowered her lace from her chest, freeing her boobs that had clearly been aching from my touch. I took each of them into my mouth, sucking and biting hungrily.


She moaned, her back arching off the bed.


"Yes.Yes.More."


My dick jerked again, screaming to be freed from my pants. Screaming to go into her.


But I wasn't ready. Not yet.


Claiming her lips again, I let my hand wander down her thigh, down, down, until it got to the G-string shielding her.


Pushing it aside, I parted her nether lips. She gasped in response.


"Fuck, Lyric. You're so wet," I muttered against her lips before giving the lower one a little bite.


It drove me insane that she was this wet for me. Not for anyone else, but me.


I pushed a finger in, and her soft whimper resonated round the room. I left her lips, trailing kisses down her chest to her abdomen.


I sucked on her navel, barely able to contain my moan as I drew out deep pleasure from her lower belly.


While I fingered her, I did well to rub my thumb against her swollen clit. Her back ifted off the bed,her toes curling.


"Please...." she whimpered, her arms tightening around me. "More... More..." She exploded into a scream as she came around my finger.


I felt her clit throb beneath my thumb, her toes curling. Lyric was too responsive! She was the fun type in bed.


I watched her beautiful face as she climbed down from her high, her lips parted. Her eyes were still closed when she reached for the hardness in my jeans. She moaned in protest when she was met with a barrier which was my cloth.


"Jaris..." The way she called my name. It was needy.


Who would've thought that Lyric would want me just as much as I wanted her? This was a nice combo.


I got rid of my jeans, but not my shirt. As soon as i was back on her, her hand wrapped around my erection, squeezing hard.



"Fuck, Lyric!" I hissed.


She bit her bottom lip, her heavy eyes struggling to look at me. She looked like an enticing femme fatale right now.


She continued squeezing and pulling me toward her wet entrance, small whimpers of need escaping her.This whole time, I'd been stalling, trying to rethink my decision. But she wasn't making it any easy on me.This might all be a dream in her head, but Lyric wanted me just as much as I wanted her. In a world where we might never be able to have this to
 ourselves, she secretly wanted this. And maybe i could live with that.


Rolling the condom on, I fisted myself in my hand before thrusting into her.


She gasped, her head falling back, her head going completely closed.


"Oh, Jace..." The way she moaned my name... It didn't make it any easy on me.


I drilled inside her, relishing in the feeling of finally having her wrapped around me. It was nothing likeI'd thought it'd be. It was far far better.


I'd been with a lot of women, yet none could rival Lyric right now. None was like her.


Sucking on the hollow of her neck, I forced myself to move, slowly. She was so tight, it begged the question of the last time she must have had sex.It was pure bliss.



As she wrapped her arms around me, holding me like she would for dear life, I cradled her head while I took

 her.


Tonight, it was just the two of us.


Tonight,nothing else mattered.


If Lyric hadn't betrayed me, I'd own up to this and give her a huge compliment tomorrow.


Because she was the best thing l've ever tasted.The best thing after five years.


For the first time, I didn't cum in my hand in my bathroom. I came inside Lyric Harper, the very core I've been idolizing for weeks.


For a long time, we laid still, our ragged breaths reverberating in the room. It wasn't until it dawned on me that I was still holding her like an egg or something before I regained my senses and pulled away.


She moaned from the loss of my body. Her eyes were closed now. No doubt, she was deeply asleep.

 
I fixed her lace, fixed her hair and tucked her into 
bed. I was just as spent as she was and badly needed to crash on the bed. If Lyric and I were a normal couple, I'd have fallen asleep next to her.


I got rid of the condom, fixed my pants, and opening the door, I stopped to stare at the woman in bed.I knew she was exhausted, as was I. Yet, she was so tempting, all I wanted to do was rid her of her clothes and take her again.


"Lyric Harper," I murmured under my breath. "What have you done to me?"

LYRIC



It happened.



The dream.



For over a minute since I woke up, I remained sitting in bed,replaying the dream in my head.


Someone did come.Someone that felt and sounded like Jaris. There was this continuous ache between my legs that I couldn't quite understand. But in the meantime,I focused on the unclear memories from my dream.


We had...sex.Good sex.


I gasped, my hand flying to my mouth. We really had sex. I think I need to have my head checked. Why would I keep having these sorts of dreams?


I decided to wash off in the bathroom. It wasn't until |took my first step that it dawned on me. I was very sore between my legs.


My eyes widened in horror as I fell back on the bed,staring in-between my legs. Was I supposed to feel the physical impact of my dream?
###Chapter 82

Dread settled in my stomach as I undressed to check myself. There was no smeared cum on me or anything. It didn't 'look' like l'd been touched. But l could 'feel' it. His arms around me. His mouth on mine.His smell.


This was too real to be a dream.


A few minutes later, I was with the ICT guys, asking them for a footage. Well, I was their Luna, and the moment I told them that someone might have broken into my room, they didn't hesitate to give me what l wanted.



I checked the footage, and it came as a punch to the gut when I couldn't find anything. No one had entered my room, not even while I was at work.


So, was it all a dream? Was that how the pill worked?It made everything feel real?
When I bathed that morning, I didn't try to pleasure myself. I already felt this deep satisfaction in my belly. This unexplainable peace.It bothered me.

JARIS


I had done a lot of bad things in life. Killed people for committing minor offenses, and hurt those I shouldn't have.


Yet, none had been as relieving as it was, having a taste of Lyric.


I might not have used the right approach, but I didn't even care anymore.


Last night was one of the best nights I have had in a while. I slept more peacefully and woke up feeling as a light as a newborn.


The last time I felt this way was five years ago.1didn't think it was possible for any other woman to make me feel the same way Princess made me felt back then. I thought that experience was gone forever,with her.


Throughout the meeting I had that morning,I couldn't stop thinking about her. Lyric.


It was upsetting how much space she occupied in my head, considering the fact that this lady and I are not even friends and might never be.


When the meeting finished and I headed downstairs with Nerion and my assistant, we came across a mall in the complex. It wasn't the first time I was having a meeting there, neither was it the first time I was walking past that mall. But it was the first time it drew my attention. Because I spotted a dress I knew would look good on her.


I stood, my hand gently in my shirt pocket as l observed the diamond-studded dress. I imagined her in it, her hair packed into a messy bun, her eyes dark and her lips stained with red. She'd look magnificent.



"Do you wish to get it for Marta?" Nerion asked beside me. It was all I could do not to roll my eyes at him and ask if he'd lost his mind. When have I ever gotten things for Marta myself?


Whenever she wanted to shop, I only gave her the card and let her do the rest herself.


I turned away from the show glass, resuming my walk out of the building with my entourage behind me. But as I did, I got an idea. The only time Lyric had gone shopping was for the mating ceremony.


Taking out my phone, I dialed Kael who I knew was in Darkspire.


"Kael. I need you to do something for me."

LYRIC



Jace kept me company through the morning.


We were in my room, him casually lying in my bed and talking random stuff after we just had breakfast.Someone knocked on the door, interrupting us. "I'll get it."


I stood up and opened the door, and on the other side was Kael. His eyes traveled past my shoulder,landing on Jace. His shoulders grew tense at once.


"Hi." I cleared my throat, bringing his eyes back to me.


"Lyric." Just like that, his serious expression was back. "Please, dress up. I've been asked to take you somewhere."


My brows furrowed. "Can I...know where? And who asked you?"


"Alpha Jaris. You can dress simple. I'll wait in the car."


He was gone before I could ask any question.


I closed the door, turning to Jace wth a look of 'this is what I have to go through in his hand.'


"He told you to dress simple. I don't think it's somewhere serious," Jace muttered, not looking at me.


His eyes looked distant, like he was thinking about something.







I met Kael in the car and got in the backseat.


"Can I know where we're going now?"


But the grumpy ass still didn't say a word.


We drove for some time and into a large shopping complex.Okay...


"The Alpha wants you to shop for new dresses," Kael finally said.


My brows shot to my hairline.


Okay.Was he kidding me?


"I don't... understand. Why? Are we going somewhere?"


He shook his head. "He just wants you to have them for other occasions." Getting out of the car, he opened my car door for me.I was forced to get out.


Now, I understood why he didn't tell mne about this in the pack. He knew I was likely to kick against it.


"I didn't even come with the black card!" I grumbled when it suddenly dawned on me on our way in.


"Don't worry. I have a substitute."


Right.


I had my arms crossed over my chest as we walked into the place. Two sales reps were quick to welcome me.


Kael stood back while they led me into the deeper part of the store, showing me their really pretty dresses.


They looked too expensive! How many could l possibly get from here? And why was Jaris doing this?


My stomach tightened when I thought of my last dream. Him sending me on this shopping spree wasn't helping at all.






For over an hour, I tried different dresses and ended up leaving with more than five bags. I'd wanted to stop a long time ago, but Kael showed up and told the ladies to get me more until he thought it was enough.


I was amazed.


I thanked him in the car, a part of me excited that I actually got the clothes. They were quite pretty.


I guess I'd have to thank Jaris later. As hard as it'd be.
###Chapter 83

LYRIC


Among the clothes I picked, corporate wears were among. And as I got ready to go to TCH,I wore one of them.


It was a grey knee-length dress, and I didn't think I'd ever been more in love with the color.


I went to TCH for my nightshift, my heart feeling lighter and warmer.



I wasn't new to this feeling. I was happy, and each time I was, there was always something to ruin my joy. This frightened me more than anything.


The warmth was quick to diminish when I ran into Marta on the ground floor. Right. What an awesome way to start my evening. Fortunately,she looked like she was leaving.

We walked past each other without saying a word,but that was until I recalled what I had in mind.


"Congratulations, Marta." I faked a smile as I turned to her.


She was on me in seconds,her face cold.


"I was told you have been performing a lot of wonders in the ward lately. First, it was Mr. Owen.Now it's Pete." I clicked by tongue. "You're a genius."


I didn't miss his uneasy she became. But it was Marta. She'd combust before she let someone see her guilty she was.


"Thank you. I've always been good at the game.It's the reason I've lasted in TCH and became a head doctor." She shrugged defiantly.


I forced my fake smile to stay on, even though all I wanted to do was tell her how much of a liar she was.Did she know I was the actual one behind the glory?Hopefully,not.


"That reminds me, Lyric," she stepped into my line of sight. "I've noticed your growing attachment to doctor Guinevere and would like to remind you that Guinevere is simply our supervisor. Over here, in our department, I'm your head, Lyric. So, I'd advise you start running things through me. You'll get your assignments through me, and if you have any questions, I'm the one to ask."


I bit the inside of my cheeks, forcing myself to stay calm.



"Do you understand, Lyric?" HHer gaze was piercing.


Ugh.I hated that bossy look in her face.


But I didn't give her the satisfaction of replying to her stupid words. So, I walked out on her, feeling her burning glare on my back.







Guinevere must have been keeping an eye out for me, because not long after I got into my office,she arrived.


We talked warmly for sometime before she told me about the patient demanding for me. It was enough to make my stomach drop.


Oh,gods.


I tried to bid my time with Guinevere, but it was impossible when she was hell bent on taking me to the man.


I felt a little assured that he hadn't told my secret yet.Otherwise, Guinevere's tone would have been different.



Maybe it was better I talk to him to know what he wanted and see how I could avoid him.


I was beyond nervous as I walked into the room.The man was awake, sitting up and eating. There was a woman before him. Judging from her age, I guessed she was his wife.



The man's eyes lit up the second he saw me. "It's her!"



I glanced at Guinevere, not missing the surprise in her face. "Did you treat him?" My stomach knotted with nerves. I licked my lips as l shook my head. "Let me talk to him."


The man dropped his plate. And to my greatest relief,he dismissed Guinevere and the woman before him,saying he wanted to speak to me in private.


I noticed his face lolked much better. On our way to the room, Guinevere mentioned he could be discharged the next day.


"What's the name?" He asked, his eyes raking over me.


I hesitated, then realized he could easily get it torn Guinevere if he wanted.



"Lyric."


"Lyric. I'm Pete." He sighed. "I wanted to thank you for saving me."


My throat ran dry. "I think you're mistaken, sir. 1wasn't-"


"You're a Siphon." He cut me off, the confidence in his tone chilling. "I saw your face.I know what you did."


I glanced at the door. We were alone. I could feel safe.


I didn't want to believe this man would be a threat in any way. He'd have exposed mne already,right?


"I know because, sixty years ago, my sister was one."His countenance fell, sadness marring lines on his forehead.



My eyes lit up, my brows scrunching.


Oh.



"Maelisa." His eyes were on the floor now,thoughtfully. "She was my little sister. My bestfriend.But our parents, the moment they knew what she was," his face grew tighter. "They handed her over themselves."



What?



My jaw dropped, a gasp slipping through. "They said she was a curse and meant more harm to them. They gladly took her to the King, and she was... she was..." Ye shook his head, unable to get the words out.


She was executed. There were no two ways about it.


In our world, Siphons were the greatest form of taboo. We've never been accepted. A weapon that could cause so much harm from mere touch.


The thought sent shivers down my spine.


"Before Maelisa was killed," he smiled. "She used to play with her gift a lot. She'd heal me each time I hurt myself or got sick. We didn't even know what she was yet. We only knew she could take ailment away by touching you."


Gift. I didn't miss that detail. He saw it as a gift, not a curse.



The gloom returned in his eyes when he looked at me. "What you carry is special, girl. But the world sees you as evil. You shouldn't be here. If Maelisa and I were grown enough to know better, we'd have run for the heels when we had the chance. Too bad our own parents betrayed us."


A tight ball formed in my throat. It was a difficulty to swallow.


I should run. Everyone keeps telling me. Yet, here l was, held back by something I couldn't explain.


"I didn't know there's been another Siphon in recent years,"I murmured.


"It's been sixty years. The King and his Alphas made sure to bury the truth. They didn't want the public to know and panic."



"I'm sorry about your sister." My eyes dropped to the floor. "I didn't ask to be this. If I could,I'd just want to be normal like everyone else."


"We can't really choose our fate, can we?" He shrugged. "You should take my advise, child. Run as fast as you can. These people, you might think you're helping them, but the moment they learn the truth, they'd treat you worse than a slave."


His eyes darkened. "I was there. I remember what they did to Maelisa. Nobody deserves to go through that for being something they could not control."


A cold liquid touched my cheek. I sniffled and realized I'd been crying.


I was in danger here. My kind would never be accepted.I should leave.


But Xylon... He was only getting better because of me. I didn't want to imagine what would happen if l abandon him.

###Chapter 84

LYRIC


Moments later, I left the man's room feeling more troubled. Guinevere was waiting just around the corner and watched me with beady eyes.


"Did you cry?" She looked confused.



I sniffled, shaking my head. "The man and I...we just had a light talk."


"So, what did he say? Did you treat him? I'm confused because Marta insisted it was her."



This was so difficult. But I needed to start clearing my tracks if I wanted to live.


"It was Marta. Yesterday, while going on my rounds,I briefly checked on Mr. Pete. I didn't know he was already regaining consciousness. That must've been when Marta already... you know? Worked on him. was the first doctor he saw. So, he just concluded it must be me." It was getting easier to lie by the day.


Definitely not a good thing.


"Oh. I see." Guinevere nodded. "Did he say anything else,though?"


I swallowed hard. "Yes. Just about how lonely it was when he was in coma. He's fine now."



We started walking, heading to our offices.


"Are you fine, Lyric? I noticed you've been trying not to limp," Guinevere asked, making my heart skip a beat.


Has it been obvious? How did I not notice?


"I...." I licked my lips. "It's nothing. I just hurt my leg this morning.But I'll be fine."


No. I was not fine. I needed to understand why my dream was having a physical effect on me. I got home by morning. I was exhausted and desired nothing but a warm bath and some sleep.


I got a text from Juan, asking me if I had plans for the evening or could spend time with them. I was distracted texting her back and didn't realize the person coming before me.


By the time I noticed and decided to look, my bag nearly fell from my hand.


Jaris.



He was so close. If I hadn't looked when I did,we'd have bumped into each other.


And that was what confused me. He was coming my way, knew I was distracted, yet didn't try to step out of the way. Did he want me to bump into him?


I adjusted the strap of my bag, lowering my eyes to the floor.


"Good morning, Alpha." I noticed his eyes lingering on my face.Well, there was nothing to look at. I was as exhausted as anyone could be.


He simply nodded and walked past me, not breaking his stride.



Kael was behind him and gave me a curt nod.


Seeing Kael,I realized I was forgetting something.


"Alpha!" I spun around.


He stopped walking and turned to him. This time,l was forced to look into his face. Geez. I was really hoping I wouldn't have to stare at him. It was killing;especially with the sexual memories flooding me.


"I-I wanted to thank you for yesterday. The clothes."I took a dry gulp when I finished.


I still found it a little strange that he did that. He was always so grumpy toward me that his acts of kindness felt suspicious.


Like the first time,he simply nodded and continued on his way. I was forced to roll my eyes. Grumpy ass.


It sent shivers down my spine at the thought of having sex with this man in the dream.



＊＊＊＊十



I bathed, ate and slept for a couple of hours.When I was well-rested, I headed to the kids' roomn,knowing I had something important to do.


Thankfully, the nanny I was hoping to meet was there. Mrs. Bastina had been taking care of the kids since they were born. If anyone could give me answers on their birth, it was her.


The kids, like always, were happy to see me. I helped them with their homework and chatted with Mrs.Bastina afterward.



Xylon was feeling much better. In no time, he'd be completely healed and I'd be free to go.


I was still surprised that my powers were yet to completely siphon his sickness away. When the kids were busy playing games,I confronted Mrs. Bastina with my very important question.


"Were you here when the kids were born?"


She replied without hesitation. "Not at all. But I was here even before Marta returned from Oryndor where she had the twins. I was already here and waiting to assist her."


I took a nervous gulp. Jace was right. She didn't have the twins in the country.


"Okay... But did you know when Marta was pregnant?"


"Of course," she chuckled. "I'd been working here as the head maid for six years before then.I was here even before Marta met with the Alpha. So,I know everything about her relationship with him. Including when she became pregnant."


She gazed up at the ceiling, a small smile touching her lips as if replaying the memory. "I remember everyone being so happy, then. It was a good time in Darkspire."


Yeah,I could imagine.


"And when did she leave the country?"


My question brought her down from her haze."Oh.When she was about four months gone. She and Luna Isolde were always having issues, you know?The Luna never really liked her despite being pregnant with her grandchildren. Marta was exhausted and insisted on having the kids in a calmer environment with her mother. Alpha Jaris did not object."



At four months, it was normal not to have a bump.So, if Marta wasn't pregnant, they wouldn't have any idea since she left at four months.



"Did anyone...actually ever see her with a bump?"


Mrs. Bastina's smile dropped. She finally realized my questions were heading in a specific direction.


"If you don't mind me asking, Luna, is there a problem?"



I bit the insides of my cheek for a second.


"Actually, no. I was just curious."


Okay. This was it. I had to stop here if I didn't want to look suspicious.



"Thank you for your time, Mrs. Bastina. I'l just get some rest."



I started toward the door.


"Of course, we all saw her pregnant." The woman's voice stopped me at the door. "From time to time,she sent pictures."



Right. Pictures of her possibly wearing a bump.


But she added. "There was even a time the Alpha had gone to visit her."


I bit my lip. For a moment, I thought this was it.The Alpha would have noticed it was fake if he was there,right?But what if she had been careful enough not to let him close enough to notice it was fake? Someone with a scheme like hers would undoubtedly be very smart.



I managed a smile at the woman. "Thank you."



＊＊＊＊十



To my horror, by the time I got to the room, a pack of pills was already there,waiting.


Whoever it was, they didn't just send one of them this time. They sent a whole pack. Like they expected me to keep taking it.


There was a small note beside it. 'Our little secret.'


This had gone beyond creepy. These pills don't just magically appear. Someone keeps dropping them here.


Yet, when I checked the cameras, I couldn't find anything. For Moon's sake, who was doing this to me? 

By nightfall, I was still staring at the pill, untouched.


What if none of this was a dream? And this stupid pill was only meant to convince me otherwise?


I gave it a long hard thought. There was only one way to find out if someone had been messing with my head.


I took the pill from the table but didn't swallow.I held it tight in my palm as I laid in boed.


Tonight, I'd understand if someone had been sneaking into my room or not and making me feel these things I think are dreams.


Tonight,I'll catch the culprit.

 ###Chapter 85

LYRIC


Sunlight streamed through the window, resting on my face.


I stirred awake from the discomfort, turning away from the sunlight and yawning.


My head was a little light. It took a moment longer for the memory to flood in.


Only this time...there was no memory.


I slept peacefully through the night.


He didn't come. Nobody made love to me.


Looking at the side of the bed, I found the pill there.


I brushed my fingers into my hair, completely down.


The dream didn't happen because I didn't take the pill. Did this mean all the memories truly did happen in my dream? None of it was physical?


＊＊＊＊十十



I was so disoriented that even Jace noticed while l was having lunch with him.


"Do you need a bigger spoon to turn your meal with?I could get one from the kitchen, you know?" He taunted.


I rolled my eyes, snapping out of my thoughts.


"I'm serious, Ly. For the past one minute, that's all you've been doing on this table. Now, are you gonna tell me what the hell is wrong with you?"


I finally took a bite from my fries. It was tasteless on my tongue.


I couldn't blame myself for not eating when my mind was plagued by these sex dreams.


"It's fine," I murmured.


He tried some more to get it out of me, but there was no way I was admitting to him that I'd been having sex dreams of a man who disliked me. It was too embarrassing.


"When are we telling the truth about the kids?" He asked a while later when he's given up on trying to get my problems out of me.


Here we go. Another problem.


"l-We just need time." I stabbed the mushroom with my fork.


"Time? Okay, how long sweetie? Five more years to match the kids' age? Or maybe we should wait until they're of legal age. That'll make it better won't it?"


"Jace..."


"I understand that you love the kids. Trust me, I could never mean harm to those cute little things. But we're talking about deceit, Lyric. Even they are being deceived into thinking they're with their family.Have you thought for once that their real family might be out there, mourning their loss? Marta must know where they come from. Wouldn't you want them to be reunited with their loved ones?"


Now, he did hit a sensitive spot.


I very well knew how much it hurt to lose a child. The children's parents might have been mourning their loss. Unless, they willingly gave the twins out. But we might never know if we don't try.


I just felt really bad for Xyla and Xylon. Their lives could take a drastic turn. Even Jaris might never forgive Marta. And worse, what if he grows to hate the kids? That man could be very unpredictable.


"You're right," I murmured, staring down at my plate.
"We should tell the truth."


Seconds passed.


"Goodness, Lyric. Are you crying?"


I lifted my gaze from my plate and realized I was. Oh,what is wrong with me?





 
In the end, even Jace had a hard time choosing a date to reveal the truth. But we concluded we'd get it done within the week,at least.


After lunch with him, I went for my appointment.


I was on a day off at TCH which was why I had the luxury of time.


I walked into Nivia's room and was warmly welcomed by her.


Nivia was one of the best psychological doctors.I was never really a fan of her type, but at this point,I didn't have a choice. I feared I'd lose my mind if l didn't get to understand what was wrong with me.


She offered me some tea and made me give her a brief history of what the problem was.


"Tell me all about it, dear. How did you meet this man?"



I stared at the space between my legs as I spoke."Five years ago. He took care of me when no one else did. It was just one night," a smile tugged at my lips. "But it was the best night I'd ever had." The memory was still very fresh like it happened yesterday. I still think of the very moment Jaris had taken off his mask and get goosebumps. And the magicaI moment he took mine off and called me 'Princess' when I'd expected him to mock me.


"But he hurt you." Nivia probed, her eyes studying me. "Didn't he?"



A tear slid down my cheek as I nodded. "He fixed me,then broke me."



"Okay, darling. Keep going. Now, you two met again and you think you're still in love with him?"


The question prompted me to hesitate and reflect.Was I still in love with Jaris wvhen I saw him again after five years?



I tried to remember my reaction the first day we met at his Pack. Of course, what was I saying? I'd been in love with Jaris every single day for the past five years.


I watched his lives grow inside me. I spent everyday wishing and hoping he'd find me. He never did.


"Yes," I whimpered. "I still do. But he doesn't love me anymore.He keeps hurting me."


Nivia nodded, scribbling down in her book.


"And now," I sniffled. "I keep having these dreams of him. They wouldn't stop. I don't even know what to do anymore."


"What kind of dreams?"


I nervously Fiddled with my fingers. "S-Sex dreams."


Nivia took down more notes.


"I wake up, feeling like it was real. Like I could still feel his touch on mne. I don't know what is wrong with me."


Nivia was silent for a while as she took in more note in her book. When she finally looked up at me again,she had an opinion.


"Darling, I think you're truly obsessed with this man.It's the only reason you'd be having these dreams of him.Have you considered telling him how you feel?"Huh?


For the first time since I walked in, I laughed genuinely.


Tell Jaris Dreadmoor how I felt? Not even if I get the instruction from the Moon goddess herself.


"It's not possible." I shook my head. "Both of us...we are always at a disagreement. I think we were cursed never to be together."


*+****+



I felt better by the time I left Nivia's place. She tried to convince me to open up to 'him' about how I felt,but in the end, I refused. There was no telling what Jaris would do to me if he gets to know I liked him.Our issues were probably going to escalate.


She also advised me to find a distraction so I could stop thinking of him. She advised me to hang out with friends, see a movie, read books. Just anything to take my mind off it. I thought I'd give it a try.


But when night came and I was alone in my room, I stared at the pack of pills in my hand.


Maybe the first step to healing would be to flush these down the toilet. But a strange part of me couldn't bring myself to do it.


How could I let go of the tiniest part I had or Jaris?These pills might be a mystery, but at least,they helped me satisfy some of my fantasies. Wouldn't it be foolish to just let it go?


Besides, none of it was real. I'd never do this physically with Jaris. It was all a dream.


Taking one out of the pack, I popped it in my mouth,and like the first time, the sensation came. I was at the brink of consciousness, aware of my surroundings but still not aware at the same time.


Then,he came.


He touched me and made love to me in one of the sweetest ways.Made me feel so good. How could I ever stop having these dreams of Jaris Dreadmoor?
###Chapter 86
JACE



What were the chances of bumping into someone you didn't wish to see?


For Jace, it was ninety.


He was at his father's complex, reviewing sales when a particular client walked in with a young, fine woman.



A client he hadn't spoken to in days.


Kael.



After the awkward incident at Jaris' party,Jace had been doing all he could to avoid meeting with Kael.It was stressful that everyday at Darkspire, he had to pray not to run into him.


He was sitting at the sales desk, the big book open in front of him. But his mind totally left the book and was occupied with Kael making his way into the shop with the beautiful lady's hand around his.


They both tensed when they locked eyes on each other.



The sales girls approached them immediately,offering them a warm welcome. But the woman beside Kael did the talking as he was busy staring at Jace.



It took all of Jace's willpower to end the awkward stare and rise to his feet.



"Kael. I'd love to say we're glad to have you here but,this is the women's section." He tried to sound as grumpy as he always did, only it wasn't too effective at the moment.


"I have eyes, Jace. I'm here for her."


The woman stopped talking with the sales girls to look at Jace. "Hi! Do you own the place?"


"You could say that." "Okay, cool. We're here to change my wardrobe, and I heard this is one of the best places for that."



She went with the sales girls to make some selections with Kael accompanying her.


Her hand remained around his. And somehow,Jace couldn't get his eyes off it.


It was none of his business. She was beautiful, and any man would be lucky to have her.


Of course, an asshole like Kael was capable of love.He was lucky to have someone like her.


He returned to his seat, going through the reports. A minute later, he was still stuck on one page. Of course, why wouldn't he when he couldn't stop staring at the couple in front of him.



His throat suddenly felt dry. He requested water from one of the girls, and the clumsy girl accidentally spilled some on him.



"Oh, my! I'm so sorry!" "What is wrong with you, Camille!?" Jace roared at her, thumping his fist against the table. "How many times will you keep making these stupid mistakes!?"


The lady startled, her hands shaking slightly."I'm sorry. It won't happen again."


She quickly grabbed a napkin to dab the water.


Looking at the couple again, Jace found Kael staring at him. Somehow, that infuriated him.


"Why don't you keep your eyes on the clothes?" He rasped.


Kael cocked a brow. The other girls in the shop looked at him with surprise.


That was when he realized. He was overreacting.


Damn it. He was never one to get easily angry. What was wrong with him today?


Concluding he needed some air, he angrily left the shop.


Just outside, Camille was wringing the napkin she had used on the water inside. She looked very sad.


Jace realized he was wrong for what he did. Camille was one of his best staff. He shouldn't have yelled at her like that.


"Camille." He placed a hand on her shoulder, making her look at him. "I didn't mean what I said,okay?I just got mad and-"


He paused when her eyes widened like she had seen something shocking. She was staring past his shoulder.



"Sir!" She screamed just before she flipped them around, trying to bring them both to the floor.


Gunshots rang through the air. Repeatedly. Then everything went blank.

"Prepare hin for triage!" I shouted at the nurses as we wheeled him on the stretcher.
"Clear the space! Make way!"


Blood.


My hands were covered with Jace's blood.


It wasn't the first time I was dealing with blood.But it was the first time it was someone closest to me. My bestfriend.


Jace was dying. The lady that had been shot alongside him was already dead on arrival. She was unlucky as the silver bullets had penetrated deep into her heart.


Jace got some in his chest, but his heart must be mildly wounded as he was still alive. But he was bleeding to death. We were losing him.


Guinevere came in to assist me and the nurses.


"We've administered some fluids but his vitals aren't stabilizing," I said, my heart racing as I prepped the equipment.


Guinevere accessed him. "The bullets must have penetrated his heart. We need to perform surgery to have them removed."


She was right. Without the surgery to remove the bullets, my powers won't work on him. I couldn't siphon physical things. So, there was no way he'd heal if I tried to siphon the pain away while the bullets were still physically stuck in his heart.


My hands shook as we rushed him to the surgical ward.Kael was waiting outside and came to us.


"How's he? Just tell me the truth!"


He was covered in blood. He had rushed into the hospital carrying Jace on his back.Considering how heavy Jace was, I knew it must have required a lot of strength.


"He'll be fine," I threw at him without a glance.


Reaching the surgical ward, doctor Guinevere prepared to perform the surgery.


"I'll do it." I doned the normal gloves. "I can do it." This was no time to hide my powers. It was Jace. It didn't matter if I got caught or not. I wasn't losing him.
###Chapter 87 

LYRIC


After an hour, the surgery was successful.


As soon as the bullets were out and my hands continued touching him, I felt him getting better.


The other doctors didn't know what was happening.Didn't know I was making everything faster with my powers.


"He'll be awake soon. He just needs some rest now,"I told the other doctors before leaving the ward.


I rushed to the restroom to wash my hands.I was still shaking, and before I knew it, I was in tears.


I almost lost Jace. If I hadn't been here to save him,it'd have been a whole different story.


Who would dare do this to him? Jace never stepped on people's toes. Why would anyone want him dead? 
I spent a long time in the restroom until I was calm enough to leave. Jace had been moved from the surgical ward to a normal room. He was still asleep,Kael beside him.


"Are you sure he'll be fine?" Kael asked in a raspy voice the moment I made my way in.


"Yeah. You don't have to worry."


I paused, actually taking the moment in. Kael being worried about Jace. It was strange. Though, it was a beautiful sight.


"Can you tell me what happened?"I inquired.


Kael took his time, going over the details. He was sure they'd come for Jace, because, had his late staff not flipped them over, he'd have been the one dead.


I felt so bad for the lady who didn't make it.


Just as he finished the narration, Jace stirred awake.

I gasped, running over to meet him."J-Jace! Are you alright?"


He let out a small grunt, his hand going to his chest,his eyes fluttering close.


"Tell me. Do you feel pain anywhere? Just tell me."


He hesitated for a moment before shaking his head.Then, he opened his eyes.


"I'm fine, Lyric. What happened?" He looked around."Camille..."



"You're fine." I breathed. "That's all that matters,Jace."


"You need to be stronger than this, you know? You gave everyone a scare," Kael said, making Jace to look at him.



"I didn't ask you to be here. Go back to your girlfriend, wherever she is." Jace was in pain, yet he couldn't miss the chance the talk back at Kael, even as he spoke weakly.


"What the hell? She's not my girlfriend. That's my sister,dummy."


I noticed Jace's surprise. His Adam Apple was visible as he swallowed."Whatever."



He looked at me. "Camille. Was she brought in as well? How's she?"


My countenance fell, the words too heavy to let out."I'm sorry. Sh-She was already dead on arrival."


"What?" His face crumpled up.


"I'm sorry, Jace."


He forced himself to sit up, even though I triedto stop him.


"Camille is dead!?" A tremor ran through his voice."Damn it!"


He buried his face in his palms, his shoulders shaking. She must have been a really good staff. Of course, she saved his life.


"It should have been me," he lifted his face from his palm to say. "They came for me,but Camille took the bullet instead."



His eyes smoldered with rage as he looked at me."We know who did this."



"Jace..."



"What're you talking about?" Kael stepped forward.

"You know who wants you dead?"


"Yes. And as a matter of fact, you know her too."


"Jace, no." I put a hand on his.


"No. Let me be, Lyric! If you had let me done this when I wanted to, maybe Camille wouldn't be dead.At least, she wouldn't try to kill me when everyone would have eyes on her."



My hand dropped from his, pain stabbing at my chest. He blamed me for this.


"Who are you referring to?" Kael insisted. "A life was lost here. You shouldn't hold back."


There was silence for a heartbeat."Wh-What're you doing?" I panicked whenever he rose from the bed.



"I'm going to Darkspire. I'm telling Jaris the truth."


Oh,gods.


"B-But you can't be on your feet already.You have to-"


"I feel perfectly fine, Lyric. I believe you also know that," he snapped at me.


My heart just kept getting hurt. It was the first tme Jace was really angry at me.


Well, maybe I deserved it. I stopped him from telling the truth and now his friend was dead.



He stormed out of the room with Kael following.And a minute later, I did the same.







Marta was on her off day. She was at Darkspire when we arrived. Jace went right to Jaris' office. Unfortunately, he was also home.



My eyes were swollen from how much I'd cried during the ride home. The kids were about to get heartbroken. Even Jaris was about to get heartbroken.Why did Marta have to do all of this?


I followed Jace to Jaris' office where he requested an audience.



"I have something important to share, but I need Marta present."


When Kael added that it was important, Jaris gave the go-head to send for Marta.


The Alpha kept staring at me but I couldn't even meet his gaze. He must probably be curious about me crying.


A while later, Marta walked back in with Kael and also Luna Isolde.



Goodness, this was about to get very messy. Marta couldn't hide her nervousness when she looked at Jace. I watched her try and fail to put on her mean look.



No. Today, she was fully terrified.


"She's here. What is it you have to share?" Jaris leaned back on his chair, but his expression was beyond curious.


"Marta here tried to kill me," Jace began. "My staff died trying to save me." He looked at Marta as he said this part. "Camille was a good girl. She didn't deserve that."


Marta held his stare until he looked away, taking them back to Jaris.


"She tried to kill me because I discovered something interesting about her."


"Stop this madness!" Marta finally spoke for the first time, her voice shaking.



Jace didn't even glance her way. "Alpha Jaris, Xylon and Xyla are not yours. Marta was never pregnant for you."
###Chapter 88

LYRIC


The room fell into heavy silence. Heads turned to Marta.



Luna Isolde sprang to her feet. "What!? What nonsense is this!?"



Jace continued with his narration. "Five years ago,on the thirteen of June, we met in Oryndor. I didn't know who she was, neither did she. But when I got to the Pack, I noticed she had been avoiding me. lt wasn't until I met her that I realized why." He looked at Marta. "When we met in Oryndor, she should have been eight months pregnant. But she was not. Her stomach was as flat as that of a model's."


My pulse quickened, like I was the one who just got exposed.


"No." Marta shook her head, going closer to him. "You are a bloody liar from the pit of hell.I have never met you before now. I'd never have anything to do with you!"



"Are you sure?" Jace tilted his head, his expression taunting. "Take a look at what you did to me, Marta.Too bad you missed."


Tensed silence filled the room as Marta and Jace engaged in a heated glare challenge.


"Marta!" Luna Isolde rasped. "What is he talking about? You better start explaining yourself. Tell me this is nonsense!"


"Of course, it is!" Her eyes glistened with tears as she whirled around to face the Luna. "I don't know this guy. He's just some worthless human trying to ruin things for us! Everyone saw me pregnant! I kept sending pictures! Even one time," she turned to Jaris."You came to visit, didn't you? You saw me pregnant.So,how could any of that be fake?"


I looked at Jaris. The Alpha remained eerily silent, as if he were carved from rock. He'd been like that sinceJaris made the revelation, and even if he was quiet, I knew better than to underestimate that kind of look.It was a mood that depicted how furious he was.


"Please!" Marta was in tears now. She too must be terrified of Jaris' mood. "He's lying."


She suddenly turned to me. "Is this you? Are you looking for a way to kick me and my kids out? I can understand if you're desperate, Lyric, but coming after my poor kids? How shameless can you be?"


Wait, what? My jaw dropped, and it took me a moment to get myself together.


"Have you gone crazy? You think I'd come up with something this huge just to sabotage you? You think I'd risk everything for a lie?"


Now I was mad at her. How could she try to pin the whole thing on me?



Jaris stood up, and the tension in the room amplified.Even Marta seemed to hold her breath as she watched him walk from his table. He pinned her with his stare, his jaw set on a hard line. Time seemed to stretch, until finally, he stood toe to toe with Marta.



More tears spilled her cheeks, her breath unsteady.


For a moment, he simply looked at her, his eyes dark and unreadable.



"Do not lie tome, Marta." His voice was like ice when he spoke.


I couldn't help but shiver from where I stood.This wasn't looking good. Jaris was mad furious and was only trying so hard to control it.


"Is he telling the truth?" He completed his question.


Marta shook her head so hard I thought she'd get dizzy. "I swear to you, they are all lies! I'd never lie to you, Jaris. Xylon and Xyla are ours."


Jaris nodded, but anyone could tell his calmness was deceptive. "You wouldn't mind a DNA test, then,would you?" The sudden fear that crept onto Marta's face was evident. It almost gave her away.


"...I..." She wiped tears from her face. "Jaris, that isn't necessary. We don't have to waste any time on what this nuisance said."


Jaris lifted his hand to her cheek, gently stroking it."Marta," he called calmly. "If I find out you're lying to me," he shook his head. "It'll not just be the worst mistake of your life. It'll be the one that ends you."


I noticed her shiver. She was too scared to say another word.


Moving away from her, Jaris met Jace. "And you, if |find out all of these were a lie, you'll regret you ever knew me."



Jaris looked too threatening. He looked every bit like the terrifying Alpha he was. The ruthless man who killed people without second thoughts. The one who ripped out that poor boy's heart at the club months ago because he thought they were forcing themselves on me. At this point, I was scared for Jace. I really did hope he was telling the truth.


"You have nothing to worry about. I have a reputation and wouldn't come up with something like this if it were a lie," Jace replied.


Jaris held his gaze for a moment before he moved away from him.


"Call Beatrix," he said to Kael on his way out."Tell her I need her here to take my samples and that of the kids."


Marta covered her mouth with her palms just as Jaris left the room. She was visibly shaking.


This didn't look good.


****+****+



MARTA


She ran into the living room and found her parents and grandmother together.


They looked at her in surprise, obviously from how

 teary she was.


"Marta,what is-"


"Who did you hire?" She cut her grandmother off from speaking, her voice raw with pain and age.


The old woman looked at the others in surprise."What is the problem? He's dead."


"No, his staff is. She was the one who ended up dead, while the son of a bitch survived! And now,he's gone to Jaris with the truth!"


"What?" Her mother rose to her feet. "Wh-What did you just say?"


"Jaris knows?" Her grandmother's eyes rounded in panic.


"Yes! And he just took the kids' sample for a DNA.What am I supposed to do?"


Her bag slipped from her hand to the floor, followed by her burying her face in hrr palms.


"Jaris knows," she sobbed. "He knows the truth. A-

 And in a couple of days, the result will be out and I'll be fully exposed. I'll be done for! He'll kill me!"


She sobbed profusely.


Her grandmother stood up, marched toward her, and before Marta knew it, she was struck hard across the face.


"This is your fault, you shameless whore!" She spat."If only you had closed those things you call legs. If only you didn't go sleeping around when you were supposed to be pregnant, we wouldn't be in this situation."



Marta wept more as she straightened, yer hand over her hurting cheek.


"Now, who are we supposed to get out of this one?After everything we've done! How hard we've worked! You had to ruin it."



"I didn't know! Oryndor was far away! How was I supposed to know that the one the stranger | was going to sleep with would end up coming to Darkspire five years later!?"


Her grandmother struck her again, harder this time.She whimpered as her head reeled from the impact.


"That's the point, stupid child! You are not supposed to know. You are supposed to be careful!"


She angrily placed her hands on her thighs as she turned away, pacing the room.


"W-We need to come up with something," Marta's mother brushed her fingers through her hair."Who took the samples? Maybe we could get to know who this doctor or nurse is?"



"It's not possible," Marta shook her head. "She's Jaris' aunt. She'd never go against him."


And that was when the Monroe family knew they were truly fucked.
###Chapter 89 

LYRIC



Things were not fine. The aftermath of the situation was exactly why l'd been scared of revealing the truth.



Since the previous day after the samples were taken,Jaris hadn't been home. What bothered me the most was the fact that the twins were very sad and worried.



They didn't exactly know what the problem was, but they knew their father was mad about something and hadn't been home because of it.



"Aunty, do you think daddy will come home today?"Xyla asked, lifting her head from her drawing book to look at me.



I stuttered for words. "He's not taking our calls. And we were supposed to show him some pictures," she made a pout.


Xylon nodded, showing his agreement.


My heart clenched painfully. Jaris hadn't been taking their calls? Was that necessary?


This-This was exactly what I feared. The whole thing affecting the kids. I was scared Jaris would stop loving these kids.


"Don't worry. I'm sure he's jau very busy. Daddy will be home, okay?" I ruffled their hair.


Xylon took up his writing tab, and after a few seconds, showed me what he wrote on it. "Can you take us to him?"



"Do you know where he is?" Xyla asked.


My mouth opened and closed for sometime, unable to come up with a response.


"I uh...I don't really know if-"


"Please, aunty. We're worried about him." "I'm sorry, honey, but I don't know where he is."


The kids exchanged glances.


"We think we might do," Xyla whispered. "Daddy has a private vacation home. We think that's where he goes to when he's mad."



Oh.


"B-But we don't know where it is,". Xylon spoke with difficulty.


Against my will, I found myself asking around for Jaris' vacation home. I was actually scared of what his reaction might be if I showed up with his kids, but I think he was wrong for ignoring them. They didn't have a hand in any of these. He shouldn't let them suffer for the mistakes of their mother.



I had to contact Kael to get the truth. He was reluctant, of course. Then I reminded him of when I helped him with Jace and made him understand he owed me a favour. Turned our the guy was more reasonable than I thought.Although he did warn me never to mention to Jaris that I got the info from him.


I wore a simple pair of jeans and a black top. Just before I left the room, I slipped the scan out of my drawer to look at it.


A longing smile painted my lips as I traced the edges with my fingers.


My babies. Our babies.


Perhaps, if they were alive, things would be different for Jaris. Maybe he wouldn't feel much like a loser.


I tucked the picture back into my drawer before leaving the room.







Marta wasn't home-she hadn't been since morning and nobody knew where she was. So, I couldn't tell her I was taking the kids to Jaris.


Hopefully,the nanny would when she asks.


It was about two hours drive to get to the location Kael had given me.The place was so quiet and private, with numerous flowers and trees decorating the pathway.


When we reached the gate, the securities fortunately let us in after recognizing the kids and me.


I drove through for a couple of minutes before I reached the main house. The mansion,actually.

I took out a moment to admire the beauty of the place. It was beyond stunning! Who would've known that Jaris had something like that just wasting around as a vacation home?


I exited the car with the kids, my eyes still darting around the place. There were four cars in thelot,cars that weren't in Darkspire. So, obviously,aside the numerous cars in Darkspire, he had extra ones just waiting here.


In the corner of the compound was a huge waterfall,the a coming out of the mouth of a built-up wolf.It was magnificent.


The mansion looked like a vacation home indeed, because it looked so peaceful.


Holding the kids' hands, I walked to the front door and knocked.


A young woman in an apron opened up almost immediately.


"Good evening, ma'am." She dipped her head. Her eyes beamed when she saw the kids. "Xyla! Xylon!How're you,dearests?"


"We're fine Ms. Reyes," Xyla answered while Xylon nodded.


"Is Alpha Jaris in?" I brought the woman's attention back to me.



"Oh. Yes, he-does he know you're coming?"


Just as she asked, I noticed a movement behind her.Then,Jaris appeared.


He stood behind the woman, his impressive height towering over her.

 
I'd do anything to see the expression on my face.I'd bet I looked like a child drooling at her favorite snack.


The Alpha was wearing simple black pants with a black turtleneck top. His hands were casually slipped into his pockets, and if it wasn't the most simple,yet charming sight I'd seen.


I tried to shut them out-the memories-but failed woefully. They hit me like a storm, filling my every senses.


I felt his lips on mine, his hands all over my body, his sweet scent, his moans.


I cleared my throat and dragged my eyes to the floor.What was wrong with me?


"Daddy!" Xyla and Xylon chorused as they ran to him.


The woman had stepped out of the way, giving them access to the grumpy-looking Alpha. To my relief, he welcomed them with a bright look.


Thank goodness. I'd been scared he'd push them off or something. "Hey. How're you doing?" He dropped to a crouch,tousling their hair.


"We're fine, daddy. We were worried about you."


He smiled and straightened up. "Why don't you go with Mrs. Reyes? She'll give you some milk in the kitchen."


When he looked at me, his eyes were hard. "With me,Lyric."
###Chapter 90

LYRIC


Okay...why was he sweet with the kids and not with me?


Adjusting the strep of my bag over my shoulder, I went after him.


The inside was more beautiful than I imagined with a black theme.



I didn't want to imagine the amount of money that must have been put into this place.


I continued walking behind Jace until we reached an office. Oh. So, he had a home office here as well.


"What're you doing here?" His voice was icy.


I couldn't hold his stare and was forced to lower mine to the floor. He didn't look like the man that had been happy to see his kids a while ago. "I asked a question," he clipped.


Fuck this,Lyric. Stop showing him your weakness.


"The kids wanted to see you." My voice came out stronger, my eyes snapping to meet his.


"I came here for a purpose. To be alone."


"W-Well, I'm sorry, but you heard them.They were worried about you."


"And you think it is in your right to be the one to bring them to me?"



His words touched a nerve."Marta wasn't home. And maybe if you were taking their calls, this wouldn't have happened. I understand that you're angry and all, but you shouldn't take it out on the kids. They don't deserve this."



"Stop trying to lecture me. You know nothing!"He yelled at me, making me yelp.


Fear and hurt ran through me. I was only trying to help.What exactly was my offense!? I'm sorry," I gritted. "It was a mistake coming here.I'll just take them and leave."


I started for the door.


"Damn it. Stop right there!" He sounded less angry.


I forced myself to stop moving.


My fingers tightened around the strap of my bag.1didn't turn around to face him.


"You know me, Lyric." He was calmer now but sounded frustrated. "I love them. The last thing l want to do is ignore them."


I turned to him, and the look in his face made me worried. For the first time, I saw beyond his ruthlessness and grumpiness. No, he didn't look like any of that right now. Right now, he appeared very sad.



It was a first.



"I have been through a lot of shit, you know? But paternity fraud has never been one of them. And it's never been something I thought I'd get from Marta."He brushed his fingers through his hair.


"When the twins came, I felt beyond happy. They're the most important to me. Getting to learn that they might not actually be mine... I have the right to be fucking upset, Lyric. And I don't want to be alone because I'm avoiding them. I want to be alone because I don't even know how to deal with them right now."


I shrugged. "You handled them pretty well out there."


"I could barely try," he scoffed.


He leaned against his table, pinching the bride of his nose.


"I don't know. I don't wanna hurt them."


Wow. Seeing Alpha Jaris like this was actually a rare sight. It was quite sad too.


For a moment, I was speechless. I didn't want to say anything that'd make things worse. "T-The kids don't even need you to do much. They just want to be around you-that's all."



He said nothing.


"Please, Alpha. Until the test is done, they're still your kids at least. Don't do this to them when they know nothing about it."


He swept his hand over his face, and he was back-the mean,ruthless Alpha.


He pushed away from the table, walked past me and out of the office.



I released a deep breath before going after him.







Fortunately, Jaris heeded my advise and tried to act naturally around the kids. Mrs. Reyes-who I got to know was the house help and had been the one taking care of the house even when he was away-already made dinner and served the table for all of us. The kids joked about their birthday choices at the table. Xyla was a talkative and would argue for minutes whenever her brother countered one of her ideas.



My heart warmed at the sight of Jaris laughing a few times when the kids said or did something funny.



I was surprised when Mrs. Reyes came down and said she was leaving. I'd thought she'd be sleeping in or something. Jaris meant it when he said he wanted to be alone.



The kids,however, had a different plan in mind.


"Can we sleep over, daddy?" It was Xylon who asked.



"Yes! Tomorrow's weekend, daddy. We don't have no school! We could sleep!" Xyla was ecstatic.


"l-I love the vacation home."



I glanced up at Jaris, and at the same time, he was staring at me. The kids looked too happy and hopeful.How would he turn them down like this? "Of course. This is our home." His smnile did not quite reach his eyes. I had a feeling the statement 'our home' must have gotten to him.


It'd stop being their home when the DNA result comes out in a couple of days and the kids turn out not his. I was so afraid of him hating them.


"Ye!!!" Xyla jumped on her feet. "Thank you,daddy!"She touched my hand on the table. "You should stay,aunty.Stay!"


What?


I withdrew my hand from hers. "N-Not at all, darling.I'll just leave after this."


"You can stay if you want."


I froze.It was Jaris.



Our eyes locked.


"There are a lot of rooms here. If the kids want you around..." He shrugged.
###Chapter 91
LYRIC



My lips parted but no words formed. Jaris was asking me to stay. He might not be straightforward about it,but he wanted me to stay.



When I still didn't say a word, Xyla started another conversation. And fortunately, the conversation drifted from me.




····


So,I did stay.


The twins and I spent some time watching a movie in the home cinema. Yup. Jaris had a freaking cinema built into his mansion.



The twins slept off before the end of the second movie. I had to carry them one after the other to their rooms.



When I was done laying them both in beds and tucking them in, I turned to the door and startled when I found Jaris leaning against the doorframe.



Geez! That gave me quite a stare. "Good job." He tipped his head toward the kids.


I glanced back at them, not helping the smile that spread on my lips. Well, wwhat could I say? | enjoyed taking care of them.


"How has Xylon been of recent?" He asked.


"He's great. He hasn't had any of his epistles of recent.In no time,he should be completely fine."


His eyes lingered on the kids on the bed."Thank you,Lyric."


"Oh, it's nothing. We had an agreement, remember?was supposed to take care of him and-"


"For bringing them over," he clarified.


My heart fluttered.


Oh, Jaris! You need to stop doing this! Stop playing with my emotions! You can't be sweet when you want to be, then go on to hurt me after and make me conflicted.



I blinked rapidly and smiled. "It's my pleasure."


He stepped away fromn the door.


"There are some clothes in the closet of your room.They belong to Marta, but you can pick something from there."



I nodded, listening to my heart race as he walked out the door.







In my very large and well-furnitured room,I stood in front of the dresser, helplessly staring at the pills in my hand.



Yes, as stupid as it looked, I did come with them.


I don't know, a part of me had expected this would happen and I would somehow need to sleep with the kids. I didn't want to be stranded without the pills if that happened.


I was getting addicted to these dreams, it was starting to bother me. But there was only little I could do when Jaris was so hot and the only time I got to be with him was in my head. In these dreams.


With slightly shaky fingers, I popped one into my mouth.



****	＊＊＊本十



JARIS



I watched the footage from my phone. When she took that pill-I couldn't explain what I felt. I had my suspicions that those pills would be with her and she might want to take it. That's the reason I installed a camera when she was in the cinema with the kids.



It was the same thing I did with her room back in Darkspire. It was how l'd gotten to know she didn't take the pills four nights ago and was hoping to see if it was all a dream or not.



I had to install the camera to know when she took the pills or did not. Because the last thing I wanted was jumping into Lyric's room in the middle of the night while she was awake.



The cameras were so tiny, she couldn't see them.And the only time I looked at them was at night to know if she'd taken the pills or not. As much as I'd love to look at her at other times, I wanted to give her some privacy.



The joy I felt when she took the pill could not be overemphasized.I needed the distraction.



Lyric Harper might not know it, but she had been making me happy in a lot of ways of recent.


I kissed her in bed, enjoying how happy she was to have me here. She moaned into my lips,running her hands through my chest. 
She was always so responsive to this. It made me wonder if she'd ever do this without the pill. Did she like me in reality? Or does everything end in the dream?


I had a feeling she'd never forgive me if she ever gets to know about this, though. I just didn't know how bad it was going to get.



I undressed her in no time, got her on her hands and knees, and thrust into her.



She had the best moan. The way she screamed when I went balls-deep inside her sent blood rushing faster in my cock.


"Oh, Jaris...!" Her fingers gripped the bedsheet tight.


"Yes?" I gritted, hardly able to recognize my own voice. "Do you want me to stop, Lyric?"



"No! No! Never!"



I took her savagely, as hungry as I was.


For a long time, I satisfied the both of us. In the end,we came multiple times.







I woke up late in the morning. Not that it mattered.The office didn't open during the weekends. I felt better like I always did after my time with Lyric.I couldn't believe I'd be managing to live without this for years.



I freshened upo in the bathroom and went downstairs to see what was happening. From the staircase, I could already hear the aroma and laughter coming from the kitchen.



I slackened my steps as I got close, listening to my kids laugh.



My kids.



By tomorrow, that was likely to change. 2


For a man with my position, I'd seen a lot of things.But Jace's accusation was bigger than I'd ever expected. Not even in a million years would I have thought Marta would dare play the paternity fraud on me.



Plus, I had actually seen her pregnant.



But maybe that was the problem. I only 'saw'. I never touched her. And the whole time, she always had clothes on.



What if Jace was right? What if she had been careful enough to deceive all of us? The dark thoughts of what I'd do to Marta had taken a temporary spot in my mind. But most importantly what would I do with the kids?


My thoughts came to a pause when I reached the entrance of the kitchen.



Lyric was frying something in the pan. Xyla was sitting on the kitchen counters playing with a spatula, and Xylon was sitting on one of the stools facing the kitchen island, just before Xyla.


A foreign feeling tugged at my heart as I took in the sight. It was the first time I was having something like this-a woman cooking in my kitchen, surrounded by my kids who laughed at whatever she said.


Right there, I looked like a man watching his family make breakfast. I knew this wasn't new to a lot of people who had lovey families, but I'd never given a thought to it and had no idea it could actually 'look good.'

###Chapter 92


JARIS



"Daddy!" Xyla screamed when she noticed me from the counter.



I didn't miss the color that crept onto Lyric's nose the moment she saw me. Why did she always have this reaction around me?



A dark thought settled in my mind: Did she also have this reaction when she let Zarek touch her?



I pushed the thought aside, deciding to enjoy the moment.



I went closer to the kids, taking Xylon into my arms while I planted a kiss on Xyla's hair.



"Good morning, Alpha." Lyric dipped her head,her nose still pink.


I was starting to grow irritated with her calling me 'Alpha.' In her dream mode, she always called me by my name. I think I liked that better.


"How was your night, Lyric?"| regarded.


I noticed the color reached her ears as well. But now. I think she was embarrassed about something. About having those 'dreams,'maybe?


"It-It was fine." She quickly went back to stirring what was in the pan.


"Daddy see! We are making breakfast!" Xyla said excitedly.


I glanced at the pile of waffles and pancakes.


"I thought you didn't like waffles?" I drew my brows at her.



"Yes! But aunty promised I'd like hers. So, I want to give it a try."


It was still amusing to me how well Lyric handled the kids. I've never seen them this free and happy around Marta or even their nannies. What was it with Lyric?


"So, what did you learn? Can you make waffles on your own?" | teased.



"Yes,daddy! All you have to-"


"Liar!" Xylon cut her off, laughing.


"I'm not lying! I can make waffles!!" Xyla glared daggers at him. Then, she went ahead to state the recipe. "Is that correct, chef?" I looked at Lyric who was already laughing. Even I knew the answer to my question. I didn't need to hold a spoon in the kitchen to know my dear daughter had just said gibberish.



"Yes! Yes, of course, I'm right!" Xyla clapped for herself.







Thirty minutes later, we all ate on the table.


And just like that, the burden from two days ago was gone. I didn't worry about the DNA but focused on the precious moment before me, which was all thanks to her.



If she hadn't taken the bold step to bring the kids to me,none of this would've happened.



I was starting to get confused about Lyric. She could make everything feel good one minute, and the next,she was ruining it. Why did she have to go sleep with Zarek? Why... why did she have to ruin the perfect moment we were building?



No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't forget that. It was the constant reminder that she could do it again to another man.Somneone else would get to see her smile, see her laugh. Her her moan. While none of that should bother me,it did.



The sound of my phone ringing interrupted the moment. I'd been getting a lot of calls since two days ago,most of which lignored, but when I saw the name on my screen, I knew it had to be important.


"Hey, Patrick." I dropped my fork.


Patrick was a Deputy for the Packs. He oversaw inter -Pack crimes and mostly helped to keep everyone in check.



He never called for pleasure, only when there was something important.


"Alpha Jaris. I think you might want to come down to Willow Way," he said.



Willow Way was not too far from my Pack. As a matter of fact, every member of Darkspire had to travel through that road before getting to the Pack.



"Why? What happened?"


He hesitated. "It has to do with some of your guys.Just get down, please."


I dropped the call, breakfast already tasting sour in my mouth.



"Did something happen?" Lyric's eyes were filled with concern as she asked.


"Yes. I'll be back."



I went upstairs, changed and was soon out of the house.







Five of my people had been killed. They all seemed to have been in one car as there was only one found by the side of the road while the bodies littered everywhere.



"We think they must have been driving in this car,"Patrick said as he walked me to the car which was turned upside down. "Then, something must have hit them. Although, there is no sign of a car crash anywhere. So it's possible someone or a group of persons must have lifted the car off the road while they were driving."



"While they were driving?" I knitted my brows in his direction. "It shouldn't be possible for a wolf to do something like that. They'd have been run over by the car. Unless the car wasn't in motion."



"That's the only possible explanation, Alpha Jaris.Because as we can see, the car was turned over. Then,the men were dragged out and murdered. And that's where the problem is." He led me to one of the bodies, squatted and tilted their head for me to see. "Take a look at this. Bite marks. It looks like someone had sucked on them.Those bloodsucking creatures are a myth and do not exist, and to further prove it, these claw marks indicate that this had been done by a wolf." He pointed at the claw marks on the victim's hand.


He was right. Those were wolf claws.



"So, a wolf clearly did this. But why would they bite another wolf? We only bite humans when we want to kill them, but the bite of a wolf can't kill another wolf.And strangely," he frowned, his eyes lost staring at the corpse. "It's the only marks they have on them.There's nothing else indicating how these men were killed."



The atmosphere suddenly became uncomfortable for me. I adjusted the neck of my shirt, the fabric suddenly choking.



I didn't like this one bit. Majorly because it was looking too familiar. But it shouldn't be possible.



"I need to know who did this, Patrick. These are my men." I looked at the faces of the victims on the ground and named them. They were born into Darkspire. I couldn't begin toimagine how devastated their families would be. "I'm working on it, Alpha J. I also want these bastards found."



I made arrangements for the bodies to be taken to Darkspire. But | couldn't go back there. Not yet.


On my way back to the vacation home, I called 'her'again.Margaret.


She didn't take the first call. So, I had to call again.


"Alpha J-"



"Where was your phone, Margaret? You know how much I hate waiting." I couldn't help the irritation that filled my voice.


"I-I'm sorry, Alpha. The first call ended before I could get to the phone."


"My brother." I adjusted the neck of my shirt again.Why was it so tight. "I want a photo."


"Oh." She hesitated. "Is there a reason, Alpha?"


"I need to see him and be sure he is in there."



"I see. O-Okay,Alpha. Unfortunately, I am not at the location right now.But-"


"Margaret, I need that photo within the hour. Not even a second late." I dropped the call, my hand tightening around the steering.
###Chapter 93 

LYRIC



I was reading a book on my phone when a text popped on my screen, freezing the air in my lungs.


'Hi, Lyric. Have you missed me?'


It was from Roderick, and it was accompanied with a photo of me at the airport from when I newly came into the country.



What the hell? He had taken a photo of me that day?


But most importantly, why was he texting me?



The doorbell ringing interrupted my thoughts.



I scrambled off the bed and into the living room to check who it was. The kids were in their room, playing a video game.



Who could possibly be visiting Jaris?



I opened the door and was met with surprise when l found Marta.



Unlike her, she didn't have any makeup on. Her hair looked like it had been hurriedly brushed and parked. Her eyes were swollen, indicating she had been crying.


Wow. Marta Monroe looking pale. It was a rare sight.


She looked at me from head to heel with disgust. In her state, that didn't look good on her.



"Where are my kids?" Her voice came out croaky



"They're-"



"What're you even doing here?"


I looked away. Gods, I wasn't mentally prepared for this.



"And how dare you take my kids without my permission, Lyric? Have you lost it? If you need kids to control,go get yours."



My eyes snapped at her.Seriously?


"That's dumb coming from you, Marta. And I don't think you're in any position to make such remarks.You know, considering the fact that these kids are not even yours."



Her eyes darkened just before she slapped me. This time, I didn't hesitate. I hit her back and pushed her so hard she almost fell on her butts.



"I thought I was clear when I told you never to lay your filthy hands on me!?" I yelled.


She chuckled as she brushed her fingers into her hair.But I could see tears glistening in her eyes.


"Oh, Lyric." She laughed. "Dear Lyric. How bold you have become."



I was about to retort something when a car pulled up behind Marta. It was one of Jaris' cars. Marta also turned around for a look, and we watched as Jaris stepped out of the car.



He paused for a moment, his gaze lingering on Marta.Then,he continued walking,wearing a frown.



"Jaris..." Gone was the feisty look on Marta's face.Now shw looked pathetic.



"What're you doing here?" Jaris asked coldly as he stopped before her.



"I-I'm sorry. I just came to see the kids."



Jaris nodded, then looked at me. "Bring the kids out to her."



"What? Jaris, come on. I can see them inside."


"Let's be clear, Marta. The only reason I'm not kicking you out is because the kids are here and you have the right to see them. Don't ever make the mistake of thinking you can come anywhere near me."



Her eyes glistened with tears. "This isn't fair,you know?Just letting a random guy ruin our lives."



Jaris' gaze was colder when he looked at me again."I told you to get the kids."



He huffed and walked past me before I even went into the house. He went into the kitchen and Marta didn't dare come in with us.



I got the kids and left them with Marta outside the house before going to meet Jaris in the kitchen.He seemed really pissed. He'd been that way since he exited his car. Did it just have to do with Marta?


"Are-Are you alright, Alpha?" I leaned against the wall,remembering he'd gotten an urgent call that made him leave the house.



"I am," he grumped.



"Are you sure? You don't look-" I stopped when he sighed.


Okay. Maybe I was bothering him.


"There was an attack on some of our people," he mumbled, going back tos to stirring what was in the cup. Ooh. Jaris was opening up to me.


But did he say an attack?



"How? What happened?"



He went ahead to tell me about a Rebel attack that happened in a strange way. He sounded really pissed about it. Well, of course. Jaris hated when people messed with him.



"I'm sorry. I'm sure they'll be found and justice will be served," I assured him.



I heard the door opening and returned to the living room to find Marta bringing the kids in



Oh,seriously.



"Marta, come on. He told you not to come in."



"Get out of my face, bitch. I'm only bringing my kids in."



My mouth dropped open, shocked at the fact that she used an unfiltered curse word in front of the kids.I don't even think she noticed.



She stepped closer to me, speaking in a lowered tone so only me could hear.-"1won't let this happen. This whole thing you're trying to do-stealing my kids' trust and attention and wanting to play the boss of Jaris'home." She scoffed. "I'll die before I let youI take my place,Lyric. Let this sink."


I shook my head in disbelief. "With everything going on, that's all you're concerned about? Position? Do you even care about the well-being of your kids? Are you concerned about how all of these would affect them?"



"Please, shut up. Stop trying to play mummy here."



"Seriously, you need help, Marta. I wouldn't be surprised if you really bought these kids to claim your position beside Jaris. After all, that's all that matters to you."


Her eyes turned darker. She looked like she was about to hit me, but Jaris' voice rang through the air.


"Marta.Out."



She balled her hands into fists as she looked at him."Jaris-"



"Don't make me do something nasty in front of the kids."



The kids looked so confused. They kept sliding their gaze from one face to another, probably wondering what was going on.


Okay. They've seen enough. "Come on, now," I took their hands. "Let's go play games."


I took them upstairs, leaving Jaris and his baby mama to sort themselves. Although, considering who Jaris was, I was sure it wouldn't take him anything to kick Marta out.







The evening went pretty smooth.



The kids demanded ice cream, and instead of ordering one,Jaris suggested we all go out to get it.


I was surprised and enthralled when he asked me to come along.



I sat in the front seat next to him while the kids played with their tabs in the backseat. Along the way,they got into an argument over a headset. They had identical headsets and only one was in the car. Xyla claimed it was hers, but Xylon insisted it was also his.



Before we knew it, Xyla was already crying as Xylon was the one holding strongly to the headset and wouldn't let it go.


"Come on, honey. It's okay. The second one must be at home. When we get back, you can use it." I turned partially to rub her legs. "No! This one's mine. I wvant it!" She tuned the volume of her cry.


Jaris simply sighed and shook his head.


"Seriously, I think it'd have been much better if they'd gotten different colors," I whispered to him.


"Not my fault. The store only had one color left when I went to get it," he answered without taking his eyes off the road.



I thought real hard on a solution. Neither of them was sure who owned it, and one would be hurt if the other got to use it.


Gently, I took it from Xylon.


"There. No one is using it, okay? When we get home,I'll give it back."


Xylon made a pout but didn't protest. Xyla stopped crying.



Geez! Kids could be really dramatic.



Settling back in my seat and staring out the window,I thought of the ones I lost. I imagined them being Xylon and Xyla. I imagined us in this very position-Jaris driving, me in the passenger seat, and the kids fighting in the backseat. A small smile touched my lips

 at the realization of how beautiful my life would've been.



Unfortunately, we couldn't always get what we wanted in life.







We reached the ice cream truck and the kids ended up ordering for more things.



We spent some time in the park, which was really fun.I almost didn't want us to go back.



Later that night, I took the pill and Jaris came to me in my dream. He made sweet love to me, completing my day.



****十



We were having breakfast when Jaris got a call. I noticed him hesitate before taking the call.



"Beatrix."



I knew that name. That was the doctor performing the DNA test.



My spine straightened, my curiosity going to its peak.


"Good. Have it delivered here." Jaris ended the call.


"Is that..." I glanced at the kids. He simply nodded before returning to his meal.


A while later, Beatrix arrived with the result. She said hello to the kids before leaving, because Jaris asked her to leave.



I stood alone at the dining with him as he opened the envelope. For the first time, I saw Jaris Dreadmoor nervous.



He took out the result, and I watched as his eyes moved around the paper.


For a long moment, he was quiet, his eyes still on the paper.


"Wh-What does it say?" I couldn't believe my voice was almost shaking.



His jaw clenched as he folded the paper and fixed it back into the envelope.



"Get the kids. We're going to the Pack." His voice was like ice as he spoke and walked away.
###Chapter 94
LYRIC



Jaris wouldn't say a word the entire ride home. But he looked pissed. Very pissed.



Did that mean the result wasn't good? Were the kids not his?



When we reached the Pack, he asked for Jace and Marta. But while Jace was in, Marta wasn't. He called her and ordered her to get to the Pack House immediately.



"What's going on?" Jace asked when we were alone on the balcony.



"| don't know. The results are out, and he's been acting all weird."



My mind went to the kids who were already in their room. Was this the point where their lives went bad?Gods. What would Jaris do about them not being his?



After waiting for a long time, Marta did come. We all met in Jaris' office.



Luna Isolde, Kael, Nerion and some other guards were there as well. Marta looked so scared. Jaris, seated in front of his table, had his hands clasped together. It took him sometime before he spoke.


"The results are out."



The tension in the room rose.



He stood up, his eyes pinned on Marta as he walked toward her.



A small whimper left her lips as she took a step back.She was nearly shaking.



"Jaris,please..."



Jaris stopped in front of her, tucking his hands in his pockets. "I'm sorry, Marta. For doubting you."



Time froze in place. Confusion filled the faces of everyone.



"You were right. I never should've listened to him." He looked at Jace.



Okay. What was going on? What was the result?



"Jaris, talk to me. What is the result?" Luna Isolde demanded impatiently.


  
"The kids are mine." Jaris kept his heated gaze on Jace."The result was positive." I didn't miss the shock and confusion that covered Marta's face. Jace's mouth dropped open in shock. My heart flipped in both relief, surprise and fear.



I was scared for Jace as much as I was confused. Did he lie about the whole thing?



In a split second, Jaris was onto Jace, punching him in the face. I ran to them immediately, holding Jace back from retaliating in any way.


"Fuck, don't touch me like that!" Jace growled,his lip bleeding.



Jaris was still pissed. "You dare lie to me."



"I didn't. Okay?! I don't know how the hell the test came back positive, but I know what I saw. Marta was never pregnant."


"Jace, you keep lying and I'll do things that'll mnake your father weep."



I put my hands on Jace's chest, trying to calm him down. This didn't look good. I didn't even know how to feel.



"Lock him up!" Jaris ordered the guards in the room



They were on Jace in a minute, dragging him away



Oh,goodness."Alpha Jaris, please!" | quickly went to Jaris who was already walking back to his seat.



Marta burst into tears, burying her face in her palms.Luna Isolde shook her head and walked out.



"P-Please. I think this was all a misunderstanding," I pleaded with Jaris.



I knew it wouldn't mean well for Jace if he was locked up here. Jaris could hurt him in a lot of ways. And the Alpha wasn't a good man.



"Everyone, out!" Jaris ordered, angrily grabbing a file from the table.



"Thank you," Marta whimpered. "Thank you for giving me your trust again, Jaris. I am so glad you finally see the truth."



She hurried out of the office. Nerion went next, but Kael stayed behind with me.



"Alpha,please..."



"Your friend is not getting away with this, Lyric." Jaris glared at me. "Do you even know what I went through for the last four days? I was torn between liking and avoiding my own kids. Do you know how hard it was to avoid their calls when they called because I didn't know what to say to them? Because I was conflicted?" "Iknow,Alpha! l was at the house, remember? It's just..."I huffed. "Jace wouldn't do this. It's... It's not like him to lie about things. He's never lied to me."



"Well, it's obvious you don't know your friend."



"Please.J-Just get him out and we can talk about this."



"And what makes you think I want to talk about this?"His stare turned serious.



He looked too cold. Gone was the sweet man I'd been with for the past two days. This one didn't care.



"Please-"



"I asked everyone to leave, Lyric!" He rasped.



I shuddered from the hostility in his voice. I finally turned and left.



****十＊＊＊＊＋



MARTA



Marta was home again. She was with her family when she got called by Jaris, demanding she came over.



She had contemporary running away, but her grandmother forced her to go answer to him, lettìng her understand that Jaris would come after the entire family if she did run. 
They assured her they'd come up with an excuse to rescue her from Jaris' wrath.



What Marta never expected was for the test to come out in her favour.


No. She knew something was wrong.



Jace hadn't been lying. She was never pregnant for Jaris but had gotten the kids from someone in Oryndor. That result should've never been a match.


"What did you do?" She asked her parents as soon as she found them in the living room. Her grandmother was just climbing down the stairs.



"How're you here? I thought you'd be locked up or something?" The aged woman asked.


"Did you do something,Grandma?"



"Something like what?"


"Like... manipulating the result or something. Did you find a way to get to the doctor?"


"What're you saying? We all agreed that was impossible."


"What the hell is going on? Talk to us!" Her father urged. Marta brushed her fingers through her hair as she started pacing the room. The whole situation was making her lose her mind.



"Marta..."



"The result was positive!" She shouted, stopping to look at her. "T-The DNA. The kids belong to Jaris."


A heavy silence blanketed the room. They all looked at each other in awe.
###Chapter 95

"What?" Her mother murmured. "How's that-How's that possible?"



"They can't be his, Marta. We bought them,remember? Or did someone manipulate the results?"


"Beatrix is Jaris' aunt. She'd definitely want to know if her nephew was being deceived, and if he was, she'd expose it. She wouldn't cover up for us for any reason."Marta pulled at the roots of her hair. "This isn't right.Something isn't right."



"Hold on," Her grandmother took a seat. "Are you trying to say the kids we arranged for and bought in a far away country are actually Jaris' kids? How in hell is that possible? Who's their mother,then?"



"I-I don't know, grandma. But this can't begood."Marta's eyes were wide with panic. "How did I end up with Jaris' kids? How is another woman pregnant for him and...and he knows nothing about it?"



"More importantly, who's the mother of the twins?How could she possibly let go of them when they belonged to someone like Jaris?"



"We need to find her." Marta pinched the bridge of her nose, frustrated. "We need to understand what's going on. Grandma, we need to find the woman that sold the twins to us."



"Well, we've all been trying to find Penelope for the past four days, right? There's still no sign of her."


"Okay. But we need to find her so she can tell us who the mother of the children is."



She stood in front of the window, fisting her hands.



Now, to Lyric and Jace. She was going to make them pay. They almost ruined her life. If she hadn't been this lucky, Jaris would've probably killed her by now.


She was going to make them regret trying to ruin her.


＊＊＊＊十＋＊＊＊＊十



KAEL



Kael walked through the rows of cells. As he did, the people locked up stretched out their hands to him through the bars, teasing him to touch them.



Behind him were two maids, carrying trays of assorted foods and drinks.



He stopped in front of the cell he came for, where there was a guard guarding it. "Open it."



The guard was hesitant. "Beta Kael, I'd love to, but the Alpha specifically said no one should bring him food or water unless he permits it."


For some reason, that seemed to infuriate Kael even more.


"Don't make me ask again, Michai. Open the damn gate."



"But what am I supposed to do when the Alpha finds out about this?"



"Well, who's going tell himn? You? 'Cause if you don't,then he's not going to know nothing."


The guard glanced at the maids behind him.


"They won't be saying a word, either. You have my word for it."



Taking a deep breath, the guard got the keys and opened the metal gate. Kael went in with the maids.



Seated on the floor was Jace, head in his hand. Kael paused for a moment. He'd never seen Jace look that way before. So frustrated. He must have overheard him talking with the guard, yet he didn't even try to lift his head as he made his way in.He wordlessly ordered the maids to drop the trays on the floor and leave.



"Jace." He called when they were alone.



Reluctantly, Jace looked up at him. He released a deep breath as he leaned his head against the wall.


"What're you doing here, grump? Come to mock me?"



"Shut up and start eating," Kael's voice was serious."Have you had anything to eat since yesterday?"



"What are you now? My mum?"


"Don't make me hit you in the head, Jace. I'm being serious."



"Hit me in the head and there'll be blood on this floor.And trust me, it won't be mine."



Rolling his eyes, Kael sat on the floor, facing him. Jace gave him a surprised look. The floor was dirty and all.He didn't think Kael would go so low for him.


He looked at the trays of appetizing meals. Well, he was starving.


"Thanks," he mumbled before drawing them closer to himself. The first thing he grabbed was the pack of apple juice. It wasn't until he was halfway that he regarded Kael with amazement. "Hold on, how did you know this was my favorite? Or is it mere coincidence?"



"Go with mere coincidence." Kael tipped his head.



Jace scoffed and grabbed something else from the tray to eat.



"What happened, Jace? You sounded so sure that Marta was guilty of what you accused. How did you turn out to be the liar?"



"Honestly, I don't know." He pinched the bridge of his nose. "I don't-I don't understand any of this. I could swear on my life that Marta was never pregnant.Or...did she really have an immature birth?"



"Nah. Marta gave birth in the month of July. At the right time."



"You see? Exactly!" Jace opened his palms to him."So,when I met her in June, she was supposed to be pregnant. But she wasn't, man. I'm telling you.Something-Something is wrong here."


Silence blanketed them. Then, slowly, Jace continued eating.



"I know you must think I'm a clown," he mumbled,not looking at him."Go on. Call me names. Tell me I'm a liar. I'm a-"



"You know if I wanted to do that, you wouldn't be the one to tell me." Kael flicked his gaze at him. "As much as I know you're an asshole, I know you'd never stoop so low. You must've been sure before you made the accusation."



Jace looked at him astonishment. "So, you... believe me?"



"Look, right now, we should be more concerned about getting you out. I'm still trying to talk to Jaris.You know he's very pissed as he thinks you lied to him.But one way or the other, we'll get to him."


****十十****



JARIS



I angrily paced my office, my phone in my hand,listening to the beep.



She still won't pick up. The damn woman was ignoring my calls.



I called her two more times and when I still didn't get a response, I went for my second plan.


I called the second number, and after a few seconds,it was answered. "Hello?" The little girl's voice came on the phone.


"Hey, Jamie. How're you doing?”


"I'm fine. Who's calling?"


"I'm trying to reach mummy. Is she with you? Can you give her the phone?"


She hesitated before shouting an"Okay!"



"And Jamie, tell mummy that this uncle is going to take all your candies if she doesn't take the phone from you." She should know what that means.



The child doesn't say anything in response, but soon after her, I heard her talking to her mother.


"He said he'll take all my candies away, mummy."


I heard Margaret mutter some curse words before taking the phone, finally.



"A-Alpha Jaris-"



"While I laid in bed, did you know the thoughts I had of you?" I cut her off. My blood was flowing faster,my need to kill growing stronger.


"I thought of traveling all the way to burn down your house,Margaret. I also thought of just taking you out and hanging you on a cross. I wanted to watch you suffer. I wanted to do so many things to you, Margaret And trust me, I still will-if you don't tell me why the hell you've been avoiding my calls, and why I haven't seen the pictures I asked for."


"Please," she was sobbing. Oh, to hell with her tears "I'm so-I'm so sorry, Alpha Jaris. I just didn't know what to say to you."


"What do you mean you don't-"


"He escaped!" She let out at last.


And that was when I really saw it-red. Everything snapped.
###Chapter 96

JARIS



I stopped at a spot, my fingers going into my hair and pulling at my roots. I was trying-trying so hard to remain calm. Because I knew if I had to really snap,only the innocent ones around me would get to suffer.



"What did you just say, Margaret?" I could hardly even hear myself.



"I'm so sorry. It was one of the women that was supposed to keep an eye on him. She was one of us,and we trusted her. We were just as shocked when we discovered she had him released." She was still sobbing. She was scared. And oh, she had the right to be. Because right now, I was really thinking about going over and doing all the things I imaginedlast night.



"How did she release him unconscious? It's impossible for him to get out of his condition."



"| know. But she got help. We were just as surprised,Alpha. This strange lady, she was able to heal him in mere minutes. We-We suspect she's a Siphon."



My ears rang. A Siphon!? No. No way.



"What're you saying? Siphons don't exist anymore."They were forbidden. Only death awaited a Siphon.


"They do, Alpha. At least, this very lady does.The Executioners have been secretly looking for her for some time now. She's the reason your brother escaped."


"Margaret,how long has this been?"


"It's-It's been over a year, Alpha."



"And you're just telling me!? Are you stupid?!"



"I'm so sorry," she whimpered. "We just didn't want to face your wrath. We've been trying so hard to find him."



Oh,the fools!



"Where's she? The woman that betrayed you."



"She's dead already. We killed her as soon as we discovered what she did."



Oh,now I wish they didn't. I'd have loved nothing more than to make her suffer myself.



"Your move was stupid, Margaret. As soon as he was out,  you should've told me!" I kicked the table. "I know. I'm sorry, Alpha. I'm so sorry. I thought we could handle it on our own."



Damn it, I need to punch something. Or someone.


"I need the details of the Siphon. Give me every single thing you have on her. And don't think I'm done with you. You and your incompetent people are definitely going to pay for this."



I ended the call with an angry huff and sent for my mum. She needed to know what was happening with her son.

For three days, I'd been trying to get Jaris to have Jace released. But he wouldn't even listen to me anymore.


So, I did something I knew would get him upset but was necessary.I reported the issue to Jace's father.


As soon as the Chairman heard that his son was imprisoned, he rushed over.


I stood at the balcony, watching Jaris and the Chairman argue.


"Get him out, Alpha Jaris. I'd hate to say it again." Jace's father was naturally intimidating, and right now,he was furious. But Jaris didn't seem to care.



"Your son committed an offense in my Pack. He gets punished by my rules, Lyon. You of all people should know this is how it works."



"Well, I don't care, Jaris. He's my son! And he's been there for days.I need you to get him out. This instant."


Jaris shrugged, nonchalantly. "I'm afraid I can't really do that."



"Jaris, let him go,". Luna Isolde said, walking into the group. "Come on, son. The boy was foolish,yes. But let's respect the fact that he's Lyon's son. Just let him go."



It took three more elders to come talk to Jaris before he finally decided to listen. Goodness, the boy was stubborn. It was a miracle he was actually a good leader to the Pack.



As soon as Jace was brought out, his father went to him,holding his shoulders.


"Are you okay, son? Were you hurt?"


"I'm fine." He grumped.


I also went close and gave him a tight hug. I'd been visiting him everyday since he was locked up, but seeing him out here was different. Relieving.


"I'm so sorry you went through this," I whispered before pulling out of his hold.



I didn't exactly know what went wrong, but I've known Jace long enough to know he wouldn't just lie with something that serious.



Jaris stepped up to him, the look in eyes her making it obvious he wasn't happy that Jace was free. He probably wanted him to suffer more.



"Take note, Jace Ashford, this is the last time you'll set foot in my Pack. The next time you do, there'll be no one to save you."



Jace clenched his jaw. He looked like he had something to retort, but his father's hand on his shoulder stopped him.



I felt cold liquid on my cheek, and when I touched it,I discovered I'd been crying.



This didn't go the way we planned. Now, Jace would no longer be here with me in Darkspire.


"Come on," his father urged. "They'll bring your things to the car."



Jace turned and started walking away. Then, he paused and looked back at Jaris. "I understand you're mad and all. Maybe I'd be too if somebody lied about my kids and gave me a scare. But I. Didn't. Lie." He shook his head. "You need to look deeper, Alpha Jaris.If the DNA result accurately said positive, then it's possible those kids came from someone who was truly pregnant for you. But it was never Marta."


My heart lodged in my throat. I expected Jaris to snap.Jace was still crossing the line.


But to my surprise, Jaris didn't. Instead, his brows furrowed, as if he was surprised.



Jace continued walking with his father, not sparing another glance back.
###Chapter 97
I walked out of the patient's room, carrying the chart in my hand and going through it.



I instructed the nurse beside me on what to do to one of the patients in the chart.



I came to a pause when someone stopped in front of me. I was forced to lift my head from the book, and in front of me was Marta.



Oh,great.



"Do you need something, Doctor Monroe?" | resisted the urge to roll my eyes.


"Yes." She had a dubious smile on her face. "How has life been without your best friend being close to you?"



I widened my eyes at her. Was she really going to do this in front of a nurse.



Turning to the nurse beside me, I dismissed her.



"What is wrong with you, Marta?" I shook my head.



"Why don't you tell me? I mean, it's been two days since he was kicked out of the pack. How do you think that makes me feel?" Her smile stretched. "ReallyI walked out of the patient's room, carrying the chart in my hand and going through it.



I instructed the nurse beside me on what to do to one of the patients in the chart.

"Why don't you tell me? I mean, it's been two days since he was kicked out of the pack. How do you think that makes me feel?" Her smile stretched. "Really good."



I didn't have the time for this.



Shaking my head, I walked past her.


"If I were you, I'd be very careful, Lyric." I stopped walking. "I'm not one of those bitches who would attack you without warning you. Right now, I'm telling you to watch your back. Because you and your stupid friend will pay for what you did to me."


"And what exactly did we do?" I snapped at her."All we wanted to do was reveal the truth."



"Which turned out to be a lie. You almost took my kids from me. You almost took Jaris from me!" She came forward, her feet nearly touching mine.



"I'm going to make you pay. I'll make you regret trying to cross me. You'll see."



I had mixed emotions as I watched her leave. I was angry, but I couldn't deny being uncomfortable.Marta could be crazy sometimes.I know it.







I spent extra hours at the hospital trying to arrange some things. Before I knew it, I was exhausted and passed out on my desk. The nap was so sweet and peaceful.


When I finally woke up, I gasped at the time.


What the hell?! It was past ten! How did I sleep for so long?


I quickly gathered my things and left the office.


On my way to the car, I checked my phone and found several missed calls and texts from Jaris.



JARIS: Where are you, Lyric? Do you even know what the time is?



It was sent thirty minutes ago.



I rolled my eyes. Funny how he was concerned when he'd ignored me for three days when Jace was locked up.


I tried to call him back but couldn't reach him.


Settling in my car, my phone lit up with a text.


My face went from cool to mad when I saw the sender and the message.



Roderick: How was work today, Ly? Do you need someone to tell all about it?



Why was the asshole texting me? Like the first time, I didn't reply. I wasn't going to give him the satisfaction.



I started my car and hit the road.


I vibed to a song as I drove with ease.


Everything was peaceful.



Until it wasn't.



I came to a halt when I noticed two cars in front of me that were turned upside down. Beside them were people on the floor.



It looked like an accident.



But then, I looked closely, and what I saw made my blood freeze.



No.



On the victims were other people that had their fangs in their necks. They seemed like wolves judging from the yellow glint of their eyes.



But what unsettled me was the fact that they seemed to be sucking from the necks of the victims on the ground.


What were they sucking off? Their blood?My heart thundered in my chest as I watched the terrific scene. This wasn't normal. None of it was.Wolves shouldn't be sucking from other wolves. What was the meaning of this?


In seconds, a million thoughts crossed my mind.I contemplated calling Jaris. But before I could reach my phone, one of the strange wolves turned his head at me.



My eyes rounded, my heart stopped working and my lips parted without a sound coming out.


I didn't think. I shifted into gear, turned the wheel and made a quick u-turn. But from the corner of my eyes,I saw them coming after me.



No. No. No.



I drove as fast as I could, but they were also fast,and in no time, they were ahead of me.



What were they doing? They shouldn't be in front of a moving car!


My hands shook on the steering as I stepped on the gas pedal. Maybe I could run over them.


But I didn't have the chance as, to my surprise, they flipped my car over when I reached them. I screamed so hard as I landed roughly with my car. My entire body crashed along with it, heavy pains hitting me everywhere.


For a moment, I thought I'd pass out. Or worse, die.Not having a wolf was terrible. There was no backup for me.



My car was turned upside down when it stopped moving. They kicked my door open and dragged me out to the ground, but not before I managed to grab something from the back of my seat.


"No..." I whimpered, sharp pains still shooting through my body.



Who were they? How could they be this powerful to do this?



"Wow. She's a fine one," one of them said.



I was laying on the ground while the three of them stood hovering over me. They didn't look familiar in any way, and they had blood on their lips. Clearly,they'd been sucking the blood of those people on the ground.



Did the same fate await me? Were they going to suck my blood as well? Kill me?


The thought brought tears to my eyes. This whole thing was terrifying. No wolf should be able to do this.


"You should taste her first," one said to another. "I doubt I'll be able to stop when I start."


They chuckled and the one that had been spoken to started coming closer.

###Chapter 98
LYRIC


"No, please." I tried to sit up, but they kicked me on the shoulder, forcing me back down. I landed with a painful grunt.


The other got on top of me, his legs on either side of my waist. I felt disgusted immediately.


He grabbed my neck, and as quickly as | could,I pushed open the silver pocket knife I'd taken from my seat and stabbed him in the neck.



He growled as he stumbled back, away from me.



"Fucking bitch!" One of the other two rasped and kicked me in the belly.



I curled into a ball, my hand flying to my midriff as a low growl left me.



"Please! Please,I don't want any trouble," I whimpered,but they weren't listening.


The one I'd stabbed was writhing on the ground. No doubt he wasn't going to make it.



One of the two guys remaining grabbed my hair and dragged me to my feet. He punched me in the ribs this time.



My face contorted in agony as the pain radiated throughout my body.



Tears fell from my eyes, and in that moment, I thought of using my powers.



Like Jace said, being a Siphon, I could do a lot of things-including siphoning someone's oxygen. I could kill these men right now and save myself.



But aside the fact that I never wanted to use my power to harm people, I also didn't know how to do it.All I knew was siphoning illnesses. I knew nothing about siphoning anything else.



I decided to give it a try. I grabbed the man's hand in my hair and wished I could take his oxygen away. But I didn't even know what I was doing. It didn't work.


The second wolf punched me across the face, making me to release a painful cry. I'd have dropped to my knees, but the other still holding my hair wouldn't let me.



He was about hitting me again when a car pulled over in front of us.



I wanted to cry in relief. This had to be some sort of help.Right? I was right. It just wasn't who I'd have ever expected.


Coming out of the car was Alpha Zarek and three guards. They looked at the scene with confusion and shock.



The two wolves with me most know that they were outnumbered because they tried to get them to leave."Keep driving. I won't say it again."



I whimpered at the thought of Alpha Zarek actually leaving me in their hands. He had no reason to help me.



His brows tightened as he took in my beaten form. My hand was still holding my midriff and I was sure there might be bruises on my body.


"Let her go. Now." His voice was like steel when he spoke.



The boy shoved me to the ground, making me bruise my elbow.


"I tried to warn you," he shrugged, looking at Zarek."We'll just go back to her when we finish with you."


The fight started. The strange wolves fought with frightening strength, but in the end, Zarek and his guards managed to defeat them. I was already on my feet before Zarek came to me.


"Are you okay? Were you hurt too much?"He held my shoulders, giving me a thorough look.


I simply nodded, too shocked to form words. I nearly died! If he hadn't done when he did, I'd have died! By some strange blood sucking wolves!



He looked at my car on the road and shook his head."Were you heading home?"



Another nod.



I wrapped my arms around myself, looking around uncomfortably. What if there were more? What if I don't make it this time?



"Come on. I'll take you to the pack."


On a normal day, I'd have never agreed to be anywhere near this Alpha. But tonight, I didn't even hesitate.



I quickly grabbed my bag and phone and hurried to the front seat of his car, still looking around for any danger.



His guards didn't drive with us as he ordered them to take care of the bodies and try to know where those men came from. He also asked them to get my car to someone who could fix it.



He was overly nice. I should've stopped him. But not tonight. Tonight, I was too shocked to speak.


It was the second time I'd been so close to death.The first time was when l'd been burnt on the face with silver. I was so young, and it had been so painful l thought I was going to die.


But the fear I felt tonight was even more than I'd felt that day. Tonight, I really almost died.



"You should go to your Pack doctor as soon as you get home," Zarek said after a while. "But who were those people? What happened?"



It wasn't until I sniffled that I realized I'd been crying.But fortunately, since we were away from the scene,I could find my voice.


"I don't know. They just... I mean, I just bumped into them on the road, sucking off those people. Then,they attacked me and tried to do the same with me."



I could feel Zarek's surprise as he looked at me."What do you mean sucking off?"



I sniffled again. "Their blood."



"| don't understand. How's that possible?"

 "I don't understand either."



My mind drifted to the attack Jaris had told me about few days ago. Back then, he only said they'd found bite marks on the necks of the victims. He didn't mention their blood being sucked. Was it possible the attack had been done by these same people? What if those bite marks were there because their blood had been sucked?



In my whole years of existence, I'd never heard of a wolf that could suck from another. It shouldn't even be possible.



We were soon approaching the gates of Darkspire.I felt more safe now that I was home.


"Thank you," I mumbled. "For saving me."



"It's nothing,Lyric."



The guards stopped him at the gates, but there was someone else out there. Jaris, Kael and two other guards.



I felt so much better seeing Jaris. I couldn't wait to tell him about the attack.



"Thank you. You don't have to go in. I'll just take it from here," I said as I reached for my bag. "Are you sure?"



"Yeah, you've done a lot tonight. Thanks."


I left the car,going to meet Jaris who seemed to have been having a deep conversation with his people. But he stopped as he watched me approach.


I noticed the dark glint in his eyes. He looked pissed.Maybe he was because I was home late and he had been trying to reach me.



"Alpha-"



"Where have you been, Lyric?" He cut me off, his voice like steel.

###Chapter 99 

LYRIC



I hesitated for a moment, trying to think of the best way to handle his mood.



"I've been calling for fuck knows how long! You didn't return any of my calls! I was fucking worried,and this whole time,you were with him?! Are you for real?"



I glanced at the car behind me. Alpha Zarek was still there. His glass wasn't tainted, so we could see him.


"No! It's-It's not what you think. I tried to call back but-"



"What is wrong with you, Lyric? Do you really have no self-control? How can you be this loose?"



His words struck me deep in the heart that my jaw dropped to the floor.



Kael shifted uncomfortably and turned to the guards with him.



"Let's go,"he whispered.



I watched as they walked off, leaving me with the unreasonable side of Jaris. "How can you even say that?" I scoffed. "I don't sleep around, Alpha Jaris! So, you have no right to use those words on me!"



Now that we were alone, I felt that I could finally raise my voice. Although it came more from pain than frustration.



"Oh, spare me!" He scoffed. "You don't even know what you do. You're that desperate for sex, aren't you?It isn't just me!"



For a moment, I feared I'd have a heart failure. What was he talking about?



He sounded like I was a whore. A shameless whore he hated.



"| don't..." | shook my head, tears pouring down. "I don't understand. How can you-"



"Before we signed this agreement, I told you how important my image is," He stepped toward me,anger emanating from his pore. "I told you l didn't give a fuck how loose you were. But I made you understand I didn't want you fucking around while we were together. All you have to do is wait, Lyric! If you're so desperate for men, you fucking wait until we're done!Then,I won't stop you."



"You don't even know what happened!" I yelled at him "How can you just lay these stupid accusations against me? What is wrong with you?!" | didn't mind the fact that I was using a curse word on him. I was so pissed and hurt.



"You know what? Why don't you go back to the car with him? I'm sure you're dying to spend the night with him, huh? Go back, Lyric! You probably have more men you want to sleep with."


Everything seemed to stop. My heart. The air. Time.


For a moment, I couldn't even see Jaris in front of me as everything wvent blank. I thought I was going to pass out.


But seconds later, everything returned to normal. I could see Jaris again. I could breathe again. But my heart wasn't the same. It wasn't beating right.


I looked at Jaris now and could only see a stranger.Since I met him, he had said a lot of hurtful things to me; things that made me cry.



But none of them had been like this. None of them had tortured me this much.



It was as painful as dying.



| dragged my eyes from his face to the ground beneath his feet. So many retorts rested on my tongue. But | couldn't find the strength to push them out.



"You're unbelievable." It was all I could manage to say.


I turned around to leave but stopped dead in my tracks. No. I couldn't leave like this.



I turned back to him. He was still staring at me, his eyes as hot as mine.



"I don't know where you get these speculations from,and I don't even care. Not anymore. But know this,Jaris," Yeah, I called him by his name. To hell with the respect. "My whole life, I have only ever slept with one man, and it's the worst mistake of my life."


I let my hatred burn through as I turned and walked away, going past Zarek's car. I heard him come out of the car.



"Lyric!"


But I didn't turn. I was done with everyone. I was done with everything.



＊＊＊＊十十



JARIS



I felt a bitter taste on my tongue, and a heavy ache in my heart. For the first time, she called me by my name while she was conscious. But it rolled off her tongue with deep hatred.



Rage. Hatred. Confliction.



I felt it all at once.



For hours, the boys and I had been looking for her.I was worried that something bad might have happened.



Yet, it seemed she was with Zarek alI along.



I knew how she sounded. She was clearly trying to deny it. But I knew better. She slept with him before we got mated. Who was to say she hadn't been doing the same after then?



A car stopped by the road to drop off one of our Pack members. I angrily watched as she got inside herself.


For weeks, we've been on an 'okay' level. It was painful to know I wasn't exclusive to her body. That after everything we shared, she still went running to her side lover.



Zarek stormed toward me.



Oh,now that I thought of it, the asshole was still here.He was insane if he thought he'd be getting out of here unhurt.

 I wanted to hurt him. So so bad.



"What is wrong with you, Jaris?!" He growled at me.


I saw red as I looked at him. I balled mny hands into fists, thinking of the best way to hurt him.



"How can you be so unreasonable? Do you even know what happened to her?"



I punched him before he could say anymore.



Oh, fuck the asshole. It was all his fault. If he hadn't set up that stupid bet. If he hadn't tempted Lyric to fall for him, none of these would've happened.



"Look,you need to calm the fuck down," he growled,not even touching the part of his face I'd punched.



I was trying so hard to think straight, but it was extremely difficult with the asshole in front of me.



"I'll kill you, Zarek," I hissed. "I promise you,if you don't get away from me right now-"



"Look, I'd rather pick grass than be anywhere near you But you're being unfair to Lyric. She didn't deserve what you just did!"



"Oh, really?" I stepped toward him. "You think you're in any position to say that considering what you've done?" "Exactly! What 'l've' done. Not what 'she' did." He spoke like I was missing something. But I knew his words could only be a lie. He was an asshole who was going to die by my hands someday.



I glared at him from head to toe, wishing there were no witnesses to see me kill him.



"Get away from here," I spat, just before | turned around to leave.



"Lyric and I never had sex!"



His words froze me.
###Chapter 100
Now what was he playing at?


I turned slowly to look at him, my anger burning hotter.



He shook his head, appearing conflicted with what he was about to say.



"I only wanted to rile you up, Jaris. I wanted to get back at you for what you did with Chloe.Fuck,I never thought I'd actually be doing this-trying to speak on her behalf. But unlike you, I've got a heart, and I just realized she's a good girl and doesn't deserve this. She doesn't even know what happened that night."



"If you're saying something, you speak fast, Zarek."My words dripped with impatience. I was losing it. But it was majorly because he was making me curious.



"I tried to get her the normal way, but she didn't fall for it. She wouldn't even talk to me. So, I lured her to the garden where her drink was poisoned. It gave her illusions. She was supposed to see the face of the man she truly craved after taking the drink. So, when I showed up, she saw your face on mine.



"I was shocked when she called your name. I mean you two had just met. How could she be in love with you already? So, all those times she was kissing me she thought she was kissing you."


I was completely numb. I couldn't utter a word and could only watch as he reached for his phone in his back pocket. Tapping the screen a few times, he turned it to me to display the video on the screen.



"This is the original clip. Unmuted," he said as the video played on the phone.



I could hear her now. All she moaned the entire time while holding and kissing Zarek was my name.



My brows drew together in confusion.



"Why do you think the video was muted in the first place?" He pulled the phone away, tucking it back into his pocket.


"It was because I didn't want to hear that, Jaris. I don't know how she happened to fall for you so quickly, but she's loved you since then. And if it came down to choosing, she'd have never let me anywhere near her.And the worst part, she thinks it was all a dream. She doesn't know anything of it."


The shock I felt was like nothing I'd felt in years. Not even when Jace accused Marta of cheating.

 
I lowered my gaze to the floor and the ground seemed to spin.



"And about tonight," Zarek's voice grew angrier."Didn't you stop to think about the fact that she didn't return in her car? She was attacked on her way home,man! By some bloodsucking wolves! They turned her car over and she'd have died had I not been there to save her. She was so damn scared and only wanted to get home. From the look of things, she was eager to share them with you. But what did you do? You publicly accused her of cheating with the one man that had saved her life. You didn't even give her the chance to explain herself."



He stepped back and tsked, shaking his head as if in disappointment. "You're terrible, man."



Then,he was gone.


I barely even registered it. All I could focus on was the fact that I'd been wrong to Lyric the whole time.



A foreign feeling settled deep in my chest. It took me a moment to realize it was regret.



What have I done? How did this happen?


Everything came crashing down-how I humiliated her at the temple because I thoughnt she slept with Zarek.How rude and cold I was to her. And just now, I'd hurt her in the worst way possible. She cried so hard! "Fuck!" I snapped, pulling at my roots.


Kael and the others came to me.



"What's going on?" Kael asked like a friend concerned



I rubbed my hand over my face, a sudden ache developing in my head.



Lyric never slept with Zarek. She only kissed him because she thought it was me. She'd never cheated on me. She loved me this whole time.



I reached for my phone and tried to call her,but this time,her line was switched off.



Damn it.



"Get the car ready, Kael," I instructed without looking at him. "Now."



****	****



For a long time, we drove down the road, but we couldn't tell wwhich part Lyric had taken. There was no trace of her.



Where could she possibly go? There was no way she'd go back to the hospital. So, that narrowed the search down to hotels.


 
"Check every hotel in the city, starting from the ones closest to the Pack," I instructed. "She's got to be around somewhere. No one is sleeping tonight until we've found her."
